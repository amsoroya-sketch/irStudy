      "text": "Taking calls at night is one of the traditional duties of medical \nstudents and residents in teaching hospitals. On Call Principles \nand Protocols is designed to facilitate the transition of medical \nstudents and residents from the classroom to the hospital set-\nting. We believe that the initiation of the medical student to \nhospital practice need not be one of trial and error and need \nnot be recalled as a time of stress and uncertainty.\nThe fifth edition of On Call Principles and Protocols pro-\nvides referenced updates for the assessment and management \nof common problems for which medical students and resi-\ndents are called at night. A separate chapter on the diagnosis \nand management of stroke has been added in this edition. \nThe popular On Call Formulary, a quick reference of com-\nmonly prescribed medications, has also been expanded and \nupdated.\nWe have been careful to maintain an approach that pro-\nvides both instruction and reference while emphasizing the \nrational thought processes required for optimal patient care in \nspecific clinical situations. In this edition of On Call Principles \nand Protocols, medications are in green type and, where appro-\npriate, the thought processes behind management decisions \nand instructions are indented.\nIt is our belief that this structured approach deserves \ngreater emphasis in the undergraduate years, and we are \nhopeful that it will help students in their introduction to clin-\nical medicine.\nPreface\nvii\n",

A state-\nment on AIDS is included because of the small risk that caring \nfor HIV-infected patients poses to healthcare workers.\nThe second section contains the common calls associated \nwith patient-related problems. Each problem is approached \nfrom its inception, beginning with the relevant questions that \nshould be asked over the phone, the temporary orders that \nshould be given, and the major life-threatening problems to \nbe considered as one approaches the bedside. The names and \ndoses of medication are in green for easy location and ref-\nerence. The rationales behind questions that are asked are \nindented, and the thoughts behind management decisions \nthat are recommended are set off with a vertical green line.\nEach chapter in the second edition is divided as follows:\nPHONE CALL\nQuestions\nPertinent questions that should be asked to assess the urgency \nof the situation.\nStructure of the Book\n",

Traditionally, a physician approaches the diagno-\nsis and management of a patient's problems with an ordered, \nstructured system (e.g., history taking, physical examination, \nand review of available investigations) before formulating \nthe provisional and differential diagnoses and the manage-\nment plan. The history taking and physical examination may \ntake 30 to 40 minutes for a patient with a single problem \nwho is visiting a family physician for the first time, or they \nmay take 60 to 90 minutes for a patient with multiple com-\nplaints. Clearly, if the patient arrives at the emergency depart-\nment unconscious, having been found on the street, the chief \nissue is coma, and the history of current illness is limited to \nthe minimal information provided by the ambulance atten-\ndants or by the contents of the patient's wallet. In this sit-\nuation, physicians are trained to proceed concurrently with \nexamination, investigation, and treatment. How this should \nbe achieved is not always clear, although there is agreement \non the steps that should be completed within the initial 5 to \n10 minutes.\nThe physician first confronts on-call problem solving in \nthe final years of medical school. At this stage, the structured \nhistory taking and physical examination direct the student's \napproach in evaluating a patient. When on call, the medical \nstudent is faced with well-defined problems (e.g., fall out of \nbed, fever, chest pain) and yet may feel ill equipped to begin \nclinical problem solving unless the complete history and physical \nexamination have been obtained. Anything less is a task only \npartially completed; however, not every on-call problem can \nApproach to the \nDiagnosis and \nManagement of \nOn-Call Problems\n1\n",

It is intended as a practical guide to assist in \n­efficient clinical problem solving when on call. The clinical \nchapters are divided into four parts:\n1.\t Phone call\n2.\t Elevator thoughts\n3.\t Major threat to life\n4.\t Bedside\nPhone call \t\n\b\nMost problems confronting the physician on call are first \ncommunicated by telephone. The physician must be able to \ndetermine the severity of the problem on the basis of this \ninformation because it is not always possible to assess the \npatient at the bedside immediately. Patients must be evalu-\nated in order of priority. The phone call section of each chapter \nis divided into three parts:\n1.\t Questions\n2.\t Orders\n3.\t Informing the registered nurse (RN)\nThe questions are intended to assist in determining the \nurgency of the problem. Orders that will expedite the inves-\ntigation and management of urgent situations are suggested. \nFinally, the RN is informed of the physician's anticipated time \nof arrival at the bedside and the responsibilities of the nurse \nin the interim.\nElevator thoughts\b\nThe physician on call is usually not in the immediate vicin-\nity when he or she is informed of a problem that necessitates \nassessment, but the time spent traveling to the ward (up to \n10 minutes in some large hospitals) can be used efficiently \nto consider the differential diagnosis of the problem. Because \ntravel time is often spent in elevators, the term elevator thoughts \nhas been coined to summarize the directed differential diag-\nnosis. The lists of differential diagnosis that are presented are \nnot exhaustive; rather, they focus on the most common or \nmost serious (life-threatening) causes that should be consid-\nered in hospitalized patients.\n",

Rather than arriving at the bedside with a memo-\nrized list of possible diagnoses, it is more useful and relevant \nto appreciate the one or two most likely threats to life and \nuse them to direct questions and the physical examination. \nThis  process ensures that the most serious life-threatening \npossibility in each clinical scenario is both considered and \nsought in the initial evaluation of the patient.\nBedside\b\nThe protocols for what to do on arrival at the patient's \nbedside are divided into the following parts:\n• Quick-look test\n• Airway and vital signs\n• Selective history\n• Selective physical examination\n• Selective chart review\n• Management\nThe bedside assessment begins with the quick-look test, \nwhich is a rapid visual assessment that may enable the physi-\ncian to categorize the patient's condition in terms of severity: \nwell (comfortable), sick (uncomfortable or distressed), or criti-\ncal (about to die). Next is an assessment of the airway and vital \nsigns, which is important in the evaluation of any potentially \nsick patient. Because of the nature of the various problems \nthat must be assessed when a physician is on call, the order of \nthe remaining parts is not uniform. For example, the selective \nphysical examination may either precede or follow the selec-\ntive history and chart review, and either of these may be super-\nseded by management if the clinical situation dictates.\nOccasionally, the “Selective Physical Examination” and \n“Management” sections are subdivided, allowing the reader \nto focus on urgent, life-threatening problems and leaving the \nless urgent problems to be reviewed later.\nIt is hoped that the principles and protocols offered will \nprovide a logical, efficient system for the assessment and \nmanagement of common on-call problems.\n",

In \nmany instances, you will not know the patient you are asked to \nsee, and you may not be involved in his or her continuing care \nafter your night on call. Some problems can be handled safely \nover the telephone, but in the majority of situations, a selective \nhistory and physical examination are necessary to diagnose and \ntreat the problem correctly. Documentation is recommended \nfor every patient you examine. If the problem is straightfor-\nward, a brief note is sufficient; if the problem is complicated, \nhowever, your note should be concise but complete.\nBegin by recording the date, time, and who you are. \nFor example:\nAug. 10, 2010, 0200H. “Medical student on-call note” or “Resident \non-call note.”\nState who called you and at what time you were called. For \nexample:\nCalled to see patient by RN at 0130H because the patient “fell \nout of bed.”\nIf your assessment was delayed by more urgent problems, \nsay so. A brief one- or two-sentence summary of the patient's \nadmission diagnosis and major medical problems should fol-\nlow. For example:\nThis 74-year-old woman with a history of chronic renal failure, \ntype 2 diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis was admitted \n10 days ago with increasing joint pain.\nNext, describe the history of present illness (HPI)—the “fall \nout of bed”—from the viewpoint of both the patient and any \nwitnesses.

As a medical student and intern, and \nlater as a practicing physician, you will find that this skill \nplays a key role in choosing the appropriate investigation and \nmanagement in many clinical situations.\nIdeally, this skill is learned at the patient's bedside. However, \nsome background knowledge will help you in the accurate \nassessment and interpretation of a patient's volume status.\nFirst, terminology must be clarified. The human body is \ncomposed mostly of water (Figure 3–1). In fact, total body \nwater (TBW) makes up 60% of the weight of the adult male \nbody. Of this, two thirds is intracellular fluid and one third \nis extracellular fluid (i.e., water that is outside of cells). Of \nthe extracellular fluid, two thirds is interstitial fluid, such \nas fluid bathing the cells, cerebrospinal fluid, and intraocu-\nlar fluid. Only 7% of total body weight is intravascular fluid \n(plasma). Clinically, it is the extracellular fluid, consisting \nof intravascular and interstitial fluids, that physicians assess \nwhen determining the volume status of a patient.\nAssessment of volume status\nThere are only three basic states of volume status that a patient \ncan have:\n• Volume depleted\n• Normovolemic (euvolemic)\n• Volume overloaded\nOn approaching the patient's bedside, ask yourself whether \nthe patient is volume depleted, normovolemic, or volume \noverloaded.\nAssessment and \nManagement of \nVolume Status\n3\n",

There is a limit to how much the \nRBC membrane can stretch, and eventually the RBCs would \nburst. Similarly, you can see that if a hypertonic solution were \ninfused directly into the patient's vein, the RBCs would shrink \n(crenate) as water moved out of the RBCs and into the sur-\nrounding solution.\nFor these reasons, most IV solutions that are prepared for \nhospital use are usually close to isotonic—that is, they have \nthe same solute concentration as blood—to minimize such \nfluid shifts. Although cell membranes allow water to pass \nfreely by the process of osmosis, they limit the passage of sol-\nutes to varying degrees. Some solute molecules cross mem-\nbranes more readily than do others, depending on their size \nand physical properties.\nFor hospitalized patients, you need to consider only three \nsolutes in order to effectively diagnose and treat disorders of \nfluid balance: glucose, which is distributed widely through-\nout both intracellular and extracellular spaces; sodium, \nwhich is limited primarily to the extracellular space; and \nalbumin, which remains largely within the intravascular \nspace. The distribution of these three solutes is a fundamen-\ntal principle that will be useful in guiding your choices of \nfluid therapy.\nThe combination of 50 g of dextrose dissolved in 1 L of \nwater is known as D5W (Table 3–1). It has an osmolality of \n252 mOsm/L, which prevents the patient's RBCs from shrink-\ning or swelling. Dextrose can be expected to equilibrate rap-\nidly among the intravascular, interstitial, and intracellular \nspaces, and water follows along quickly by osmosis.\nNormal saline is another commonly used IV solution. \nIt has an osmolality of 308 mOsm/L, and although it \nis slightly hypertonic, it is not sufficiently different from \nFigure 3–4  Osmosis.

Hence, a volume-depleted \npatient could be treated with IV normal saline, albumin, or \nplasma. Because normal saline is more readily available and \nmuch less expensive, it is the treatment of choice for the ini-\ntial resuscitation of a volume-depleted patient.

Biologic systems \nare more responsive to rates of change than to absolute \namounts of change. It is safest to correct half the deficit and \nthen reevaluate the patient's condition. There is no substi-\ntute for frequent repeated examination of the patient when \nyou are trying to effect changes in volume status.\n2.\t On occasion, you will be faced with a patient in whom \nthere is a discrepancy between the two compartments \nof the extracellular fluid, such as a decrease in intra-\nvascular volume and an excess of interstitial fluid (i.e., \nedema). This discrepancy is most commonly observed \nin states of marked hypoalbuminemia.\nFluid transfer from the intravascular space to the intersti-\ntial space depends on the permeability of the capillary bed, \nhow much hydrostatic pressure is being exerted to force fluid \nout of the intravascular space, and the difference in oncotic \npressure between the intravascular and interstitial spaces (see \nFigure 3–5).\nOncotic pressure is exerted by plasma protein (i.e., albu-\nmin). There is little, if any, protein in the interstitium; hence \nthe intravascular oncotic pressure exerted by albumin tends to \ndraw water out of the interstitium and into the intravascular \nspace. This knowledge is important for treating the occasional \npatient with both intravascular volume depletion (as assessed \nby your clinical examination) and interstitial fluid excess (i.e., \nedema). To help shift fluid from the interstitium to the intra-\nvascular space in such a patient, a logical choice is to admin-\nister IV albumin. Artificial plasma expanders (e.g., gelofusine, \npolygeline, dextran, hetastarch) also may be used. These are \nglucose polymers of high molecular weight that remain in the \nintravascular space because of their large size.\nRemember that oncotic pull comes from albumin. It does \nnot come from sodium, and so normal saline is not an appro-\npriate fluid to give in this situation. It does not come from \nRBCs, and so a blood transfusion is an equally inappropriate \nchoice. Note that albumin is available in two concentrations: \n5% and 25%. The 25% concentration is preferred when you \nare trying to effect a shift in fluid from the interstitial space to \nthe intravascular space.\n",

If it is \nunclear which agents to choose or whether to choose \na basic or expanded regimen, then it is best to begin \nwith an expanded regimen immediately, obtain consul-\ntation, and modify the regimen later as more informa-\ntion becomes available.\nPostexposure prophylaxis should be started as \nsoon as possible after exposure when indicated. One \nbasic two-drug regimen recommended for adults is \nzidovudine (ZDV), 600 mg PO per day in two or \nthree divided doses, and lamivudine (3TC), 300 mg \nPO daily or 150 mg PO twice a day (available as a \ncombination capsule, Combivir). A well-tolerated \nalternative two-drug regimen is tenofovir (TDF), 300 \nmg PO daily plus emtricitabine (FTC), 200 mg PO \ndaily (available as a combination tablet, Truvada) \nwith food. The preferred expanded three-drug regi-\nmen includes one of the basic two-drug regimens plus \nlopinavir/ritonavir (200/50 mg), 2 capsules twice a \nday (available as a combination tablet, Kaletra). Other \nantiretrovirals are available but should be used only \nafter consulting an expert in this field. One month \nof therapy is recommended. Nausea, headache, and \nfatigue are common side effects of the zidovudine/\nlamivudine combination. The tenofovir/emtricit-\nabine combination can produce nausea, diarrhea, \nand headache. Side effects of the lopinavir/ritonavir \ncombination include diarrhea and nausea.\n4.\t HCV prophylaxis after exposure.\nCurrent guidelines do not support the use of antiviral \nagents in the postexposure prophylaxis of HCV.

Patients with diabetes, \nasthma, and heart disease are particularly susceptible to seri-\nous flu complications. Influenza is usually seasonal. However, \nin 2009 a subtype of influenza A virus, H1N1, caused a pan-\ndemic that did not respect seasons.\nAs a house officer, you may be the first to be in a posi-\ntion to recognize that a patient has flu and is therefore at risk \nof complications, as well as spreading the infection to other \npatients and health care workers, including yourself. As a con-\nscientious house officer, you will have taken advantage of the \nbest preventive measures and have had your annual flu vacci-\nnation. Other people may not be so fortunate.\nThe symptoms suggestive of a diagnosis of flu include fever \n(usually high), extreme fatigue, headache, muscle aches, dry \ncough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, and—particularly in \nchildren—nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\nIf you suspect that a patient has flu, you should inform \nstaff responsible for infection control, who will have devel-\noped protocols to control the spread of flu in the institution. \nThis includes vaccination of health care workers and perhaps \nsusceptible patients, particularly those who are elderly or \ninfirm.\nVaccination results in a rise in antibodies after about 2 \nweeks. Antiviral agents provide more rapid prevention. They \nmay also diminish the severity of the illness in a patient if \ngiven within 24 and 48 hours of onset, although they are \nless effective in ill, hospitalized patients. Unfortunately, the \nflu virus rapidly develops resistance; thus, the selection of \nantiviral drug may change from year to year. Two flu anti-\nviral drugs are recommended for use in the United States \n­during the 2009–2010 flu season: oseltamivir and ­zanamivir \n(Table 4–3).\nReferences\nAlter MJ, Hadler SC, Margolis HS, et al: The changing epidemiology \nof hepatitis B in the United States, JAMA 263:1218–1222, 1990.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Case-control study of \nHIV seroconversion in health-care workers after percutaneous \nexposure to HIV-infected blood—France, United Kingdom, and \nUnited States, January 1988–August 1994, MMWR Morb Mortal \nWkly Rep 44:929–933, 1995.\n",

For example, the dia-\nphragm is supplied by cervical roots C3, C4, and C5.

The pain of pan-\ncreatitis is often worsened after eating and may be relieved \nby sitting up or leaning forward. Pain that increases with \ninspiration is suggestive of pleuritis or peritonitis, and \npain that is aggravated by micturition is suggestive of a \nurogenital cause.\nAssociated Symptoms\nDoes the patient have nausea or vomiting?\nVomiting that occurs with the onset of pain frequently \naccompanies both acute peritoneal irritation and perfora-\ntion of a viscus. It is also commonly associated with acute \npancreatitis and with obstruction of any muscular hollow \nviscus. Pain relieved by vomiting suggests a hollow gut ori-\ngin (e.g., bowel obstruction). Vomiting many hours after \nthe onset of abdominal pain may be a clue to intestinal \nobstruction or ileus.\nWhat is the nature of emesis?\nBrown, feculent emesis is pathognomonic of bowel \nobstruction, either paralytic or mechanical. Frank blood \nis suggestive of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Vomiting \nfood after fasting is consistent with gastric stasis or gastric \noutlet obstruction.\nDoes the patient have diarrhea?\nDiarrhea and abdominal pain are observed in infec-\ntious gastroenteritis, ischemic colitis, appendicitis, and \npartial small bowel obstruction.

There is \nno evidence that they are more effective than the consid-\nerably cheaper H2-receptor antagonists in the treatment \nof duodenal ulcers.

PPIs and H2-antagonist treatment may suppress \nthe growth of H. pylori to a degree that interferes with the \nUBT. Several regimens exist for the treatment of H. pylori \nand are commonly referred to as triple therapy. Such regi-\nmens include a PPI such as omeprazole, 20 mg PO bid, \nand two antibiotics (e.g., clarithromycin, 500 mg PO \nbid, with amoxicillin, 1 g bid, or with metronidazole, \n500 mg PO bid). Prepackaged preparations of these \ntriple therapies are available. Resistance to metronida-\nzole has developed; therefore, the therapy that includes \namoxicillin is currently the first choice. Increased expo-\nsure to amoxicillin may well have the same effect; thus, \nit is important to monitor the sensitivities of H. pylori \nlocally. When you encounter a patient in whom ­peptic \nulcer disease is suspected, empirical triple therapy of \nH. pylori is not recommended; this should be reserved for \npatients in whom peptic ulcer disease is confirmed by \nendoscopy or in whom H. pylori infection is confirmed \nby UBT or serologic testing.\n• Pyelonephritis.

Patients with pericardi-\ntis, pneumothorax, or pulmonary embolism involving \nthe pleural surface look apprehensive and breathe with \nshallow, painful respirations. If the patient looks well, \n­suspect esophagitis or a musculoskeletal problem such as \ncostochondritis.\nAirway and Vital Signs\nWhat is the blood pressure?\nMost patients with chest pain have normal blood pressure. \nHypotension may be seen with MI, massive pulmonary \nembolism, aortic dissection that results in cardiac tampon-\nade, or tension pneumothorax. Hypertension, occurring in \nassociation with myocardial ischemia or aortic dissection, \nshould be treated urgently (see Chapter 16, pages 183-184).\nA wide pulse pressure should raise the suspicion of aor-\ntic insufficiency, which may be observed as a complication \nof a proximal aortic dissection.\nA pulsus paradoxus (see page 301) may be a clue to the \npresence of a pericardial effusion, which may be present \nwith an aortic dissection or pericarditis.\nWhat is the heart rate?\nDoes the patient have tachycardia?\nSevere chest pain of any cause may result in sinus tachy-\ncardia. Heart rates of more than 100 beats/minute should \nalso alert you to the possibility of a tachydysrhythmia, \nsuch as atrial fibrillation; other supraventricular tachycar-\ndias; or ventricular tachycardia, all of which may necessi-\ntate immediate cardioversion.\nDoes the patient have bradycardia?\nBradycardia in a patient with chest pain may represent \nsinus or atrioventricular nodal ischemia (as may occur with \nMI) or β-blockade or calcium channel blockade caused by \ndrugs. Immediate treatment of bradycardia is not required \nunless the rate is extremely slow (<40 beats/minute) or the \npatient is hypotensive (see Chapter 18, page 201).\n",

Shallow, \npainful breathing is suggestive of a pleural cause (pleuri-\ntis, pneumothorax, pericarditis, pulmonary embolism) or \na musculoskeletal cause.\nWhat does the ECG show?\nThe ECG should be reviewed immediately after the vital \nsigns are measured, to avoid delays in administering \nthrombolytic therapy if the patient is having an acute ST \nsegment elevation MI. Thrombolysis is most effective when \nperformed within the first 4 hours of symptoms; therefore, \nif an MI is suspected on the basis of the ECG, call your resi-\ndent immediately to assess the patient for possible throm-\nbolytic therapy. Remember that a normal ECG does not \nrule out the possibility of an acute coronary syndrome.\nThe ECG in a case of aortic dissection may look perfectly nor-\nmal. The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy may be evi-\ndence of long-standing hypertension, which is a risk factor for \na dissection.\nIn a patient with pulmonary embolism, the most common \nfinding on an ECG is sinus tachycardia, but a rightward axis \nshould also be looked for.\nThe ECG in a patient with pericarditis may show diffuse, \nusually mild, ST elevations and sometimes PR depression.\nManagement I\nIs the Patient Receiving Oxygen?\nEnsure that the patient is receiving oxygen at an appropriate \nconcentration.

A second common type of out-of-control \npatient is an elderly person who becomes disoriented and com-\nbative, particularly at night (the sundown phenomenon).\nNumerous other medical conditions may set off this beha­vior \nin a hospitalized patient, including intracranial disease, systemic \ndisorders (drugs, organ failure, metabolic and endocrine disor-\nders, infection, inflammation), and psychiatric disorders. Once \nthe patient is safely approachable, you should carefully assess for \nthe presence of these conditions (see Chapter 8, pages 70-72).\nMajor threat to life \nPhysical Injury\nPatients who are acutely agitated and hostile are not reason-\ning properly and may appear to be looking for a fight.

Should you need to physically restrain a violent \nindividual, the general rule is to have at least one person \nper limb plus one.\nIf the patient has already been given the halo-\nperidol you ordered over the telephone and is \nstill out of control, physical restraints may be \nnecessary. Allow adequate time for the medica-\ntion to take effect. If the patient remains agitated \n30 minutes after the initial dose, you may give \nan additional dose of haloperidol, 0.5 to 10 mg. \nThe dose may be repeated every 2 to 4 hours, up to a \ntotal dose of 20 mg in 24 hours. Elderly patients rarely \nrequire a total dose higher than 5 mg. Always use the \nlowest effective dosage.\nThe two main acute side effects of haloperidol are \nhypotension and the occasional acute dystonic reac-\ntion (spasm of the face, tongue, back, or neck). The \nhypotension is usually postural, and once the patient \nis cooperative, he or she should be assisted when ini-\ntially changing from the supine to the upright position. \nAcute dystonic reactions usually respond to diphenhy-\ndramine, 25 to 50 mg PO, IM, or IV, or benztropine \nmesylate, 1 to 2 mg PO, IM, or IV. Some of newer atypi-\ncal antipsychotic agents risperidone (0.5 to 2 mg PO \nbid), and olanzapine (2.5 to 5.0 mg PO daily or 10 mg \nIM) have fewer extrapyramidal side effects than does \nhaloperidol and appear to have similar efficacy.\n3.\t Benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam, 0.5 to 2.0 mg \nPO, sublingually (SL), IM, or IV) have a more rapid \nonset of action than do the antipsychotic drugs, but \nthey can worsen confusion. They constitute first-line \ntherapy only in cases of sedative drug and alcohol \nwithdrawal.\n4.\t Barbiturates should be avoided, because although they \nhave valuable sedative properties, they tend to cloud \nconsciousness and may actually compound the behav-\nioral problem.\n5.\t Call the patient's family, explain what has happened, \nand see whether the family can shed any light on the \npatient's behavior.

Unfortunately, the terms \ndelirium, toxic psychosis, acute brain syndrome, and acute con-\nfusional state are often used interchangeably to refer to any \ncause of confusion. The term metabolic encephalopathy implies \nthat the condition does not arise from psychiatric disorders or \nstructural intracranial lesions.\nThe two recommended terms are delirium and dementia. \nDelirium is characterized by restlessness, agitation, clouding \nof consciousness, and, in some patients, bizarre behavior, hal-\nlucinations, delusions, and illusions. Dementia is a state of \nirreversible loss of memory and a global cognitive deficit. The \nlevel of consciousness is an important distinguishing feature \nbetween delirium and dementia. Delirium is characterized by \na clouding of consciousness (a decreased clarity of awareness \nof the environment), whereas dementia is associated with a \nnormal level of consciousness. Also, delirium usually devel-\nops over a short period of time (hours to days), and the signs \nfluctuate during the day, whereas the confusion seen with \ndementia is more constant.\nDrowsiness, stupor, and coma refer to various degrees of \nunresponsiveness or diminished levels of consciousness.\nPhone call  \t\nQuestions\n1.\t Clarify the situation: In what way is the patient \nconfused?\n2.\t What are the patient's vital signs?\n3.\t Has the patient's level of consciousness changed?\nConfusion/\nDecreased Level of \nConsciousness\n8\n",

If the resting blood pressure is normal, examine \nfor postural changes. A postural rise in heart rate of more \nthan 15 beats/min, a fall in systolic blood pressure of more \nthan 15 mm Hg, or any fall in diastolic blood pressure is \nindicative of significant hypovolemia.\nWhat is the heart rate?\nIntravascular volume depletion usually results in tachy-\ncardia unless the patient has a coexisting disorder (e.g., \nautonomic dysfunction due to β-blockade, sick sinus syn-\ndrome, or autonomic neuropathy) that prevents the gen-\neration of a tachycardia. However, in diarrheal diseases, \ntachycardia may also be caused by anxiety, pain, or fever. \nA relative bradycardia despite fever raises the suspicion of \nSalmonella infection.\nWhat is the temperature?\nFever in a patient with diarrhea is nonspecific but is sug-\ngestive of the presence of inflammation, as may occur with \ninfectious diarrhea, diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel \ndisease, intestinal lymphoma, tuberculosis, and amebi-\nasis. Some organisms (Shigella and Salmonella species) \nmay cause systemic sepsis. However, sepsis may occur in \nthe absence of fever, especially in elderly patients.\nSelective Physical Examination I\nIs the patient volume depleted?

This can be \nachieved quickly by administering an intravenous (IV) \nfluid that remains in the intravascular space at least \ntemporarily, such as normal saline or Ringer's lactate. \nGive normal saline, 250 to 500 mL intravenously over \n1 to 2 hours, titrating the IV fluid to the patient's vital \nsigns and JVP. Reassess the volume status after each \nbolus of IV fluid, aiming for a JVP of 2 to 3 cm H2O \nabove the sternal angle and concomitant normalization \nof heart rate and blood pressure.\n2.\t Check the chart for a recent electrolyte determination. If \nthe patient's electrolytes have not been checked within \nthe past 24 hours, order measurements of serum elec-\ntrolytes, urea, and creatinine levels now.\n3.\t In a patient with fever (temperature >38.5°C), two sets \nof blood should be drawn for cultures. If the patient \nis also hypotensive, volume replacement should be \ninstituted with normal saline, and empirical antibi-\notic coverage should be considered (see Chapter 12, \npage 110).\n4.\t A rectal examination should be performed, and stool \nsamples should be examined for occult blood, culture, \nova and parasite determination, C. difficile toxin, and \nwhite blood cell (WBC) stain. If unusual organisms \nare suspected (e.g., in a patient with acquired immu-\nnodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]), the laboratory should \nbe alerted so that appropriate culture techniques and \nmedia can be used.\nSelective Chart Review\nAre potential causes of diarrhea apparent from the information \nin the patient's chart?\nIs the patient taking any medications that may cause diarrhea?\nMedications are the most common cause of diarrhea in \nthe hospital. Frequent offenders include laxatives, stool \nsofteners, magnesium-containing antacids, sorbitol-con-\ntaining liquid formulations, digoxin, quinidine, colchicine, \nand xanthines. Laxatives and stool softeners should be dis-\ncontinued.

In addition, pseudomembra-\nnous colitis caused by C. difficile enterotoxin may result in \npersistent diarrhea during or after antibiotic use. Diagnosis \nis usually made by means of an enzyme-linked immuno-\nassay (ELISA), which is 85% sensitive and 100% specific. \nTreatment includes discontinuing the offending antibi-\notic and administering metronidazole, 500 mg PO every \n6 hours for 10 to 14 days. Vancomycin, 125 to 500 mg \nPO every 6 hours for 10 to 14 days, is an alternative ther-\napy, but it is more expensive and no more effective than \nmetronidazole.\nDoes the patient have AIDS?\nImmunocompromised patients and patients with AIDS may \ndevelop diarrhea for many reasons, including infections \nfrom a variety of pathogens, medications (especially pro-\ntease inhibitors), and AIDS enteropathy. The most common \ninfectious causes include Cryptosporidium, Microsporidium, \nMycobacterium avium–intracellulare, Salmonella, Shigella, and \nCytomegalovirus organisms. If this episode of diarrhea is the \nfirst one documented, stool samples should be obtained \nfor acid-fast stain, WBC stain, bacterial and mycobacterial \nculture, and ova and parasite determination. The test with \nthe highest yield is microscopic examination with a search \nfor ova and parasites. The correct transport medium must \nbe used for specific pathogen cultures, and laboratories \noften require identification of the possible pathogens—\nsuch as Cryptosporidium, Yersinia, and Aeromonas species and \nEscherichia coli 0157—in order to select the most appropri-\nate laboratory techniques. Diagnosis of anorectal infec-\ntions may necessitate proctoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, with \nspecimens obtained for gonorrhea testing, herpes simplex \nviral culture, and dark-field examination for syphilis; this \ncan be arranged in the morning.\nHas the patient had recent surgery?\nPostgastrectomy dumping of hypertonic boluses of stom-\nach contents into the jejunum is associated with vasomo-\ntor symptoms of flushing, anxiety, palpitations, sweating, \nand dizziness, and diarrhea may occur in association. \nResections of the ileum and right colon may result in diar-\nrhea because of bile acid malabsorption.\n",

Do not overshoot the goal of volume repletion!\nWhile IV fluid resuscitation is taking place, obtain samples \nfor necessary cultures: usually blood from two different sites, \nurine (for Gram stain and culture), sputum, and any other \npotentially infected body fluid.\nSeptic shock is a major threat to life, and once culture \nsamples are taken, antibiotics must be given to cover both \nGram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. The choice \nof antibiotic also depends on a knowledge of patterns of \nlocal antibiotic susceptibility. Many institutions have proto-\ncols to guide empirical antibacterial therapy, particularly in \nneutropenic patients. A common empirical broad-spectrum \n­regimen includes a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin \n(cefotaxime or ceftriaxone) and an aminoglycoside (gen-\ntamicin, tobramycin, or amikacin). Alternatives to cepha-\nlosporins include piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem. \nIf methicillin- resistant staphylococci or bacterial endocardi-\ntis is suspected and therapy must be started, a combination \nof vancomycin and gentamicin can be used.\nSome patients are allergic to penicillin. Ensure that the patient \nis not allergic before you order penicillin or cephalosporin. \nAminoglycosides are common causes of nephrotoxicity and \nototoxicity. Select maintenance dosing intervals according to \nthe patient’s calculated creatinine clearance (see Appendix D, \npage 479). Monitor the serum aminoglycoside concentrations, \nusually after the third or fourth dose, and the serum creatinine \nconcentration.\n",

Even such commonly used drugs as anti-\nbiotics can cause a drug fever, which usually occurs within \n7 days after the patient begins taking the offending drug.\nAntipsychotic medications may cause the neurolep-\ntic malignant syndrome, characterized by fever, muscular \nrigidity, an altered sensorium, tachycardia, and eleva-\ntions in creatine phosphokinase, WBC count, and liver \nenzyme levels. The symptoms resolve when the offend-\ning drug is discontinued.\nOverdoses of some psychostimulants, such as \namphetamines and cocaine, may acutely elevate the \ntemperature, resulting in rhabdomyolysis and contrib-\nuting to fatal cardiac dysrhythmias. Prompt cooling, \nthe use of antipyretics, and the judicious use of tran-\nquilizers may be indicated in this setting.\n5.\t By administering antipyretics for a fever caused by infec-\ntion, you treat only the symptom. In fact, there is evidence \nthat the ability to mount a febrile response is an adap-\ntive mechanism that inhibits bacterial replication and \nenhances the ability of macrophages to kill bacteria. It is \nuseful to observe the fever pattern, and if the fever is not \nvery high (>40° C) and the patient is not uncomfortable, \nit is not necessary to treat with aspirin or acetaminophen.\n6.\t If antipyretics are ordered, ask the RN to mark the \nbedside temperature chart with an arrow to mark the \ntime of administration. Assessment of the therapeutic \nresponse is also made easier by charting the antibiotics \ngiven (Fig. 12–2).\n7.\t Steroids may elevate the WBC count and suppress the fever \nresponse, regardless of the cause.

In most \ninstances, a rapid heart rate increases CO; however, many \ntypes of rapid heart rate do not allow adequate time for dia-\nstolic filling of the ventricles, which results in a low stroke \nvolume and, hence, decreased CO. The low CO may result in \nhypotension, in angina in a patient with underlying coronary \nartery disease, or in CHF in a patient with inadequate left ven-\ntricular reserve.\nBedside \nQuick-Look Test\nDoes the patient look well (comfortable), sick (uncomfortable \nor distressed), or critical (about to die)?\n\u0007A patient with SVT or ventricular tachycardia may look \ndeceptively well if adequate BP is maintained.

Remember the risk of low-\nering pressure too quickly in patients with atherothrombotic \ncerebrovascular disease; you can precipitate a stroke!

Your goal is to get the patient to the ICU/CCU \nso that intravenous agents can be instituted in a moni-\ntored setting as soon as possible. Once the patient is in the \nICU/CCU, the goal is to reduce the diastolic blood pres-\nsure to approximately 100 to 105 mm Hg, usually over \na period of 2 to 6 hours; the initial reduction (when an \nintravenous agent is initiated) should not lower the dia-\nstolic BP by more than 25% of its presenting value.

Both temazepam and oxazepam are avail-\nable in generic formulations.\n2.\t The newer benzodiapine-receptor agonists provide no \nadvantage over temazepam and are more expensive.\n3.\t Benzodiazepines should not be prescribed on a nightly \nbasis; they should be discontinued temporarily once \nacceptable sleep has been achieved for 1 or 2 nights. \nThe use of benzodiazepines for less than 14 consecu-\ntive nights helps prevent the development of drug toler-\nance and dependence.\n4.\t Be aware of the adverse effects of any drug you prescribe. \nThe adverse effects of benzodiazepines are central ner-\nvous system depression (tiredness, drowsiness, feelings \nof detachment), headache, dizziness, ataxia, confu-\nsion, disorientation in elderly patients, and psychologic \ndependence.\n",

If acute respiratory distress and marked \nrespiratory effort accompany shock, intubation and venti-\nlation may be necessary.\nWhat is the status of the patient's circulation?\nIf hypotension is not severe, examine the patient for pos-\ntural changes.\nOn standing, a postural rise in heart rate of more than 15 \nbeats/min., a fall in systolic BP of more than 15 mm Hg, \nor any fall in diastolic BP is indicative of significant \nhypovolemia.\nMeasure the heart rate.

If overt pulmonary edema is or becomes evident, \nthen stop the intravenous normal saline. Proper manage-\nment also requires preload and afterload reduction and \nfurther investigation, as outlined in Chapter 24.\nAll other forms of shock necessitate more aggressive vol-\nume expansion. This can be achieved quickly through ele-\nvation of the legs (i.e., reverse Trendelenburg position) \nand the repeated administration of small volumes (200 to \n300 mL over 15 to 30 minutes) of an intravenous fluid that \nwill remain at least temporarily in the intravascular space, \nsuch as normal saline or Ringer's lactate.

Make sure that you are using the correct strength.\nFor profound anaphylactic shock that is immediately \nlife-threatening, use the intravenous route: epinephrine \n1 mg (10 mL of a 1:10,000 solution) administered every \n3 to 5 minutes. Follow each dose with a 20 mL flush of \nNS, and elevate the arm for 10 to 20 seconds after each \ndose. See page 445 for alternative doses and routes.\nFor less severe situations, epinephrine can be given \nintramuscularly (IM) (note the different concentration): \nepinephrine 1:1000, 500 mcg (0.5 mL) IM, repeated after \n5 minutes in the absence of improvement or if deterio-\nration occurs. Several doses may be necessary.\nEpinephrine is the most important drug for any ana-\nphylactic reaction. Through its α-adrenergic action, it \nreverses peripheral vasodilatation; through its β-adrenergic \naction, it reduces bronchoconstriction and increases the \nforce of cardiac contraction. In addition, it suppresses \nhistamine and leukotriene release.\n3.\t Hydrocortisone, 500 mg by slow intravenous or IM \ninjection or orally, followed by 100 mg IV, IM, or orally \nevery 6 hours to help avert late sequelae\nThis is particularly necessary for patients with asthma \nwho have been treated previously with corticosteroids.\n",

It is dangerous to put \nlarge doses of heparin in small-volume intravenous bags, \nbecause malfunctioning intravenous lines filled with hepa-\nrin can result in a serious overdose.\nHeparin and warfarin are dangerous drugs because of \ntheir potential for causing bleeding disorders. Write and \ndouble-check your heparin orders carefully. Also, measure \nplatelet counts once or twice a week to detect reversible \nheparin-induced thrombocytopenia, which may occur at \nany time while a patient is taking heparin.\n2.\t Low–molecular weight heparin (LMWH).\nSeveral formulations of LMWH exist (Table 19–1); \nthe different distributions of molecular weight result in \ndifferences in inhibitory activities against factor Xa and \nthrombin, the extent of plasma protein binding, and \nplasma half-lives. You should familiarize yourself with \nthe LMWH formulation used in your hospital. Also, be \ncareful to note that the dose of LMWH used in the treat-\nment of DVT is considerably higher than that used for \nprophylaxis of DVT.\nAfter heparin administration is begun, the diagno-\nsis should be confirmed in the morning by compression \nultrasonography, which is the noninvasive test of choice to \ndiagnose a first episode of DVT. If this test is not available, \nimpedance plethysmography, nuclear venography, contrast \nvenography, and magnetic resonance venography are other \noptions.

If the chest tube \nwas inserted to drain a hemothorax, a pleural effusion, or \nan empyema with straight drainage (no suction), the new \nonset of bubbling in the collection chamber represents a \nloose tubing connection, air leaking into the chest from \naround the chest tube insertion site, or the development \nof a pneumothorax.\nSelective Physical Examination and Management\nIf a pneumothorax is not present, a persistent air leak is \nindicated by air bubbles in the underwater seal section \nof the chest drainage system while the suction is turned \noff. If the air leak is small, it may be seen only if you \nincrease intrapleural pressure (e.g., have the patient cough; \nFig. 20–7).\nClamping of chest tubes before a radiograph is taken may \nbe dangerous, especially if a persistent pneumothorax is pres-\nent. Never leave a patient with a clamped chest tube unat-\ntended. A tension pneumothorax may develop rapidly if the \nchest drainage system has a ball-valve mechanism.\nThe following procedure is recommended when bubbling \npersists in the drainage compartment:\n1.\t Inspect the tubing connections to ensure that all seals \nare airtight.\n2.\t Remove the dressing at the entry site of the chest \ntube, listen for sucking sounds, and observe the inci-\nsion area. If the incision is too large and inadequately \nclosed, insert one or two sterile 2-0 sutures to seal \nthe opening.

The chest tube holes should be inside the thorax, \nand the tip of the tube should be away from mediasti-\nnal and subclavicular structures.\n5.\t If on chest radiograph the lung does not appear \nreexpanded, call surgeons for possible placement of a \nsecond chest tube and for management of the persistent \nair leak from the lung.\n",

Your assessment yields accu-\nrate findings if you draw ABG samples, begin empirical O2 \ntreatment, and adjust the patient's fraction of inspired oxygen \n(Fio2), depending on the results of subsequent ABG measure-\nments or pulse oximetry. If pulse oximetry is available, grad-\nually increase the FIo2 until the O2 saturation is higher than \n.94%; then recheck the ABG measurements.

If nitroglycerin ointment is not \nreadily available, you can administer nitroglycerin \ntablets, 0.3 to 0.6 mg sublingually, or nitroglycerin \nspray, 1 puff sublingually every 5 minutes, until \nthe patient feels less short of breath, as long as the \nsystolic BP remains higher than 90 mm Hg. All \nnitroglycerin preparations cause blood to pool in \nthe peripheral circulation. Nitroglycerin preparations \ncommonly cause headaches, which can be treated with \nacetaminophen, 325 to 650 mg orally (PO) every 4 \nhours as needed.\n• Administer morphine sulfate, 2 to 4 mg intravenously \n(IV) every 5 to 10 minutes, up to 10 to 12 mg.\nMorphine causes blood to pool in the splanchnic \ncirculation and is particularly helpful in the agitated \npatient with pulmonary edema.

If necessary, naloxone hydrochlo-\nride, 0.2 to 2 mg IV, intramuscularly (IM), or SC, up to a \ntotal of 10 mg, can be used to reverse the hypotension or \nrespiratory depression caused by morphine.

Lower counts, however, do \nnot preclude a bacterial cause of pneumonia. Lymphopenia \n(absolute lymphocyte count <1000/mm3) or a low CD4 cell \ncount (<200/mm3) is suggestive of pneumonia in a patient \ninfected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\nChest Radiography\nFindings are variable, from patchy diffuse infiltrates to con-\nsolidation (pleural effusion). Remember that a patient with \nvolume depletion may not manifest the typical findings of \npneumonia on chest radiographs until the intravascular vol-\nume is restored to normal. Trust the findings of your clinical \nexamination.\nIdentification of the Organism\n1.\t Gram stain and culture of sputum. If the patient is unable \nto spontaneously cough up sputum, you can induce it \nwith ultrasonic nebulization or chest ­physical therapy. \nTake a sputum sample to the laboratory ­yourself and \nexamine the Gram stain. Confirm that the sputum is \nfrom the lower respiratory tract (<25 squamous epithe-\nlial cells per low-power field). (See Appendix D, page \n480, for interpretation of the Gram stain.)\n2.\t Special cultures if Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella \nspecies, or fungi such as Blastomyces dermatitidis are \nsuspected.\n",

If the patient already \nhas renal insufficiency, administer the same initial dose, but \nadjust the maintenance dose or interval according to the crea-\ntinine ­clearance (see Appendix D, page 479).\nPneumonia in HIV-Positive Patients. In HIV-positive \npatients, the most common infectious pulmonary patho-\ngen is P. carinii.

In hospitalized patients, intravenous steroids have \nno advantage over oral steroids in hastening the resolution of \nbronchospasm. The optimal steroid preparation and dosage \nare controversial. However, because pure asthma is predom-\ninantly a response to airway inflammation, steroids should \nbe used early in the management of exacerbations. In addi-\ntion, steroids may take 6 hours to work, and so they must \nbe administered immediately if persistent wheezing is antic-\nipated in the next 6 to 24 hours. Prednisone, 40 to 60 mg \nPO daily, is recommended. If the patient is unable to swal-\nlow or absorb oral medications, methylprednisolone, 125 mg \nIV, followed by 40 to 60 mg IV every 6 hours, or hydrocorti-\nsone, 500 mg as an intravenous bolus, followed by a mainte-\nnance dose of 100 mg IV every 6 hours, may be administered. \nBeclomethasone dipropionate (Beclovent) is not useful in \nacute bronchospasm.\nSteroids have few side effects in the short-term situation. \nSodium retention is of concern in a patient with CHF \nor hypertension; hyperglycemia may occur in diabetic \npatients.\nTapering steroids too rapidly has been a concern.

Of more concern is exacerbation of wheez-\ning as steroids are tapered. This may limit the rate at which \nsteroids can be withdrawn.\nWhen a patient develops an exacerbation of broncho­\nspasm, a general rule is to administer medications beyond \nwhat is usually required for an outpatient.

The \nRN may not be aware of this and may unknowingly \nrequest a sleeping aid for such patients while you are off \nduty. To avoid this pitfall, write clearly in your orders, \n“No sedatives or sleeping pills.”\n5.\t Some asthmatic patients have a triad of asthma, nasal \npolyps, and aspirin sensitivity. When you prescribe \nanalgesics for asthmatic patients, it is best to avoid \nNSAIDs, including aspirin, because fatal anaphylactoid \nreactions have occurred in some patients who are given \nthese medications.\nRespiratory failure\nAny of the four conditions causing shortness of breath may \nlead to respiratory failure, as may various other conditions. \nSuspect that this is occurring if the respiratory rate is lower \nthan 12/min. or if thoracoabdominal dissociation is ­present. \nConfirm the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure by ABG \ndetermination.

If a narcotic has been \nadministered or if you are uncertain, order naloxone \nhydrochloride, 0.2 to 2 mg IV, immediately.\n2.\t If the patient does not respond to naloxone, arrange \nfor the patient's transfer to the intensive care unit/\ncardiac care unit. Acute respiratory acidosis with a pH \nlower than 7.30 may respond to aggressive treatment \nof the underlying respiratory or neuromuscular disor-\nder.

The first transfusion \nthat an IgA-deficient patient receives will contain \nIgA antibodies, which are recognized by the patient's \nimmune system as foreign antigens. Thus, the IgA-\ndeficient patient becomes sensitized and develops \nanti-IgA antibodies, which, in subsequent transfu-\nsions, may cause anaphylaxis or urticaria.\nThere are two known IgA allotypes (genetic vari-\nations in the structure of the immunoglobulin). \nAnaphylactic reactions are more common in patients \nwho lack both allotypes of IgA, but they have been \nreported in patients who lack only one allotype. \nIndividuals with IgA molecules of one allotype may \ndevelop antibodies against the other allotype, and \nsubsequent transfusion reactions manifest as urti-\ncaria or, on occasion, anaphylaxis.\n\t\ne.\tUrticaria, which can be caused by transmission of \nantigens (e.g., food allergens such as shrimp) from \nthe donor's blood. This may also occur when IgA \nantibodies are infused into an IgA-deficient patient \n(i.e., deficiency in one of the two allotypes).\n\t\nf.\tPost-transfusion purpura, which is an unusual \nimmune thrombocytopenia that occurs 5 to 10 days \nafter transfusion of a platelet-containing product \n(and can occur not only with platelet transfusions but \nalso with RBC transfusions and granulocyte concen-\ntrates). The thrombocytopenia occurs in patients pre-\nviously sensitized to a foreign antigen by pregnancy or \nprior transfusion, and it results in destruction of both \ndonor and recipient platelets. A second (also rare) \nmechanism for post-transfusion purpura is throm-\nbocytopenia caused by passive transfer of antiplatelet \nantibodies from a previously immunized donor.\n2.\t Nonimmune hemolysis, which may occur if the blood \nhas been overheated or has undergone trauma.

Some important precautions should be \nconsidered:\n1.\t The amount of NaHCO3 given depends on the pH and \nhow effective and rapid the therapy for reversing the \nunderlying cause is going to be. For instance, metabol-\nic acidemia with a pH of 6.9 is a medical emergency, \nand an initial dose of 150 mmol of IV NaHCO3 may \nbe required while other resuscitation measures are in-\nstituted. In metabolic acidemia with a pH of 7.10 in a \npatient with diabetic ketoacidosis, only 50 mmol of IV \nNaHCO3 may be required while insulin and fluids are \nadministered. You can estimate the amount of bicar-\nbonate required by calculating the extracellular buffer \ndeficit, as follows:\n(\n)(\n)\n−\n3\n3\nBuffer deficit = (normal serum HCO\nmeasured serum HCO ) body weight in kg\n0.4 ,\nwhere 0.4 is a correction factor representing the propor-\ntion of body weight that is composed of extracellular \nfluid (0.2) and the buffering provided by intracellu-\nlar components. The initial dose of HCO3 should be \napproximately half of the calculated buffer deficit. Full \ncorrection should not be attempted within the first \n24 hours because of the risk of delayed compensation \nand alkalemia with tetany, seizures, and ventricular \ndysrhythmias.\nThe HCO3 should be diluted (50 to 150 mmol/L is \nachieved by adding one to three 50-mmol vials to 1 L of \n5% dextrose in water [D5W]) and given slowly, because \nundiluted NaHCO3 infused directly can cause fatal ven-\ntricular dysrhythmias.\n2.\t In the presence of cardiac arrest, metabolic acidemia \ncan be treated with HCO3, but only after alveolar ven-\ntilation is ensured, because further depression of res-\npiration can result from a shift in intracellular pH in \nthe respiratory control center in the CNS. When ven-\ntilation is ensured, an initial dose of HCO3, 1 mmol/\nkg body weight can be administered by rapid IV in-\njection, with repeated doses of 0.5 mmol/kg body \nweight every 10 minutes during continued cardiac \narrest.\n",

The hemolytic uremic syndrome \nhas a manifestation similar to that of TTP but without the \nneurologic manifestations. These two syndromes are distinct \nfrom DIC, which is characterized by prolonged aPTT and \nPT, reduced fibrinogen level, and elevated levels of fibrin \ndegradation products. DIC most often occurs in the context \nof infection (e.g., gram-negative sepsis), obstetric catastro-\nphe, malignancy (e.g., prostate cancer), and tissue damage \nor shock.\nManagement\nVessel Abnormalities\nTreatment of bleeding that results from vessel abnormalities \nusually consists of treatment of the underlying disorder.\n1.\t Serious bleeding caused by hereditary disorders of connec-\ntive tissue and by hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia \nmost often necessitates local mechanical or surgical \nmeasures at the site of hemorrhage to control blood \nloss. In some patients with hereditary hemorrhagic te-\nlangiectasia, bleeding may be controlled with amino-\ncaproic acid.\n2.\t In the vasculitides, control of bleeding is best achieved \nby the use of corticosteroids, other immunosuppressive \nagents, or both.\n3.\t There is no good treatment for the increased vascular \nfragility that results in senile purpura. Purpura caused \nby Cushing's syndrome is preventable with normaliza-\ntion of plasma cortisol levels. However, in a patient \nreceiving therapeutic corticosteroids, the underlying \nindication for therapy often prevents a significant re-\nduction in steroid levels. Hemorrhages associated with \nscurvy do not recur after adequate dietary supplemen-\ntation of ascorbic acid.\nCoagulation Factor Abnormalities\nTreatment of coagulation factor abnormalities is dependent \non the specific factor deficiency or deficiencies.\n1.\t Specific factor deficiencies should always be treated in \nconsultation with a hematologist. Factor VIII defi-\nciency (hemophilia A) can be treated with fresh-frozen \nplasma or cryoprecipitate, but factor VIII concentrate is \nthe treatment of choice.

Because \nmany patients with liver disease also have vitamin K \ndeficiency, it is worthwhile to administer vitamin K, \n10 mg subcutaneously (SC), intramuscularly (IM), or \norally (PO) daily for 3 days. Intravenous vitamin K \noccasionally causes an anaphylactic reaction. Factor \nIX concentrates carry a risk of thrombosis and are con-\ntraindicated in liver disease.\n3.\t Vitamin K deficiency can be treated in a manner iden-\ntical to that outlined later for the correction of war-\nfarin coagulopathy. Ideally, however, you should \nidentify and treat the underlying cause of vitamin K \ndeficiency.\n4.\t The treatment of DIC is both complicated and con-\ntroversial. All medical authorities agree, however, that \ndefinitive management involves treating the underlying \ncause. In addition, a patient with DIC often requires \ncoagulation factor and platelet support in the form of \nfresh-frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, and platelet trans-\nfusions. The role of heparin in the treatment of DIC is \ncontroversial, and heparin should not be used without \nhematologic consultation.\n5.\t Bleeding that results from anticoagulant therapy can be \nreversed slowly or rapidly, depending on the clinical \nstatus of the patient and the site of bleeding.\n\t\na.\tUnfractionated heparin has a half-life of only 1½ \nhours; therefore, simply discontinuing a heparin \ninfusion should normalize the aPTT and correct a \nheparin-induced coagulopathy involving minor epi-\nsodes of bleeding. LMWH, however, has a longer \nhalf-life, and it may be necessary to reverse the hepa-\nrin effect with protamine sulfate. This may also be \nnecessary in cases of serious bleeding associated with \nunfractionated heparin. The usual dose of protamine \nsulfate is approximately 1 mg per 100 U of either \nfractionated or unfractionated heparin by slow intra-\nvenous infusion. Determine the dosage by estimat-\ning the amount of circulating heparin; for example, \nfor a patient receiving a maintenance infusion of \n1000 U of unfractionated heparin per hour intrave-\nnously, the heparin infusion should be stopped and \nsufficient protamine should be given to neutralize \n",

No more than 50 mg \nper single dose in a 10-minute period should be \ngiven. Side effects of protamine include hypoten-\nsion, bradycardia, flushing, and bleeding.\n\t\nb.\tThe warfarin effect can be reversed rapidly, as may \nbe required in life-threatening hemorrhages, by \nadministration of plasma (e.g., 2 units at a time), \nwith subsequent redetermination of PT. Although \nboth fresh-frozen plasma and banked plasma con-\ntain the vitamin K–dependent clotting factors, \nbanked plasma is considerably less expensive and is \nthus preferred. Prothrombin complex concentrates \n(Octaplex), if available, may achieve a more rapid \nor complete reversal of warfarin effect than does \nplasma alone. For severe bleeding (e.g., intracranial \nhemorrhage), urgent hematologic consultation is \nneeded. When prolonged reversal of anticoagulant \neffect is desired, vitamin K, 10 mg PO, SC, or IM, may \nbe given daily for 3 days. In patients taking warfa-\nrin, minor bleeding complications may necessitate \ntemporary discontinuation of this drug. Intravenous \nvitamin K occasionally causes an anaphylactic reac-\ntion and should be administered with caution.\n6.\t For bleeding caused by thrombolytic agents, localized ooz-\ning at sites of invasive procedures can often be con-\ntrolled by local pressure dressings; such oozing can be \nprevented by avoiding invasive procedures. For more \nserious hemorrhage, the thrombolytic agent must be \ndiscontinued. Fibrinolytic agents that are not fibrin \nspecific cause systemic fibrinogenolysis; therefore, \nfresh-frozen plasma may be needed to replace fibrino-\ngen.

In the short term, however, \na serious bleeding complication should be treated by \nplatelet transfusion (e.g., 6 to 8 units at a time). One unit \nof platelets can be expected to increase the platelet count \nby 1000/μL in a patient with inadequate marrow pro-\nduction of platelets. Check the response to transfusion \nby ordering a 1-hour post-transfusion platelet count.\n2.\t Increased peripheral destruction of platelets is best man-\naged by identification and correction of the underly-\ning problem. Often, this involves the use of systemic \ncorticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents. \nSuch patients tend to have less serious bleeding man-\nifestations than do those with inadequate marrow \nproduction of platelets, but platelet transfusion may \nbe required for life-threatening bleeding episodes. \nSignificant bleeding in patients with idiopathic thrombo-\ncytopenic purpura may respond to intravenous immune \nglobulin, followed by platelet transfusions. Platelet \ntransfusion therapy should not be used to treat throm-\nbocytopenia in a patient with TTP, because it may actu-\nally worsen the condition. The platelet abnormality in \nTTP is best treated with plasma infusion or, preferably, \nplasma exchange.\n3.\t Dilutional thrombocytopenia caused by massive transfu-\nsion of red blood cells and intravenous fluid therapy is \ntreated with platelet transfusion as required. Dilutional \nthrombocytopenia can usually be prevented by a trans-\nfusion of 8 units of platelets for every 10 to 12 units \nof RBCs transfused.

For this reason, it \nis important to be familiar with the insulin brands commonly \nused in your institution and to have an understanding of the \nvarious insulin delivery devices. The common insulin prepara-\ntions available in the United States, and their manufacturers, are \nlisted in Table 33–1. International name equivalents are listed in \nTable 33–2. Premixed insulin is also commercially available in \nsome countries (Table 33–3). Comparative durations of action \nof insulin preparations are listed in Appendix F, page 532.\nBovine, porcine, and human insulin preparations are avail-\nable, and each has different antigenic properties. Bovine insu-\nlin is the most immunogenic, and human insulin is the least. \nHuman insulin is derived from DNA recombinant techniques \nfrom either baker’s yeast (Novolin ge insulin preparations) or \nEscherichia coli bacteria (Humulin insulin preparations). Human \ninsulin preparations are associated with fewer adverse reactions \n(e.g., insulin allergy, antibody-mediated insulin resistance, lipo­\natrophy) and should be considered, especially when treatment is \nintermittent. If the patient is already receiving bovine or porcine \ninsulin without complications, the dosage of the preparation \nthat the patient is receiving may be adjusted as necessary.\nInsulin may be administered intravenously (usually re­served \nfor emergencies) or subcutaneously. The subcutaneous (SC) \nroute may involve direct injection, a pen device, or a ­continuous \ninfusion system (the insulin pump). Insulin pens are available \nthrough a variety of manufacturers and often contain par-\nticular types of insulin or premixtures. Usually the patient \nis familiar with the use and limitations of his or her pen. \nIf simple adjustments cannot be made and you must change a \npatient’s insulin dosage, it is best to use direct injection with a \nneedle and syringe, or consult your resident or a diabetes edu-\ncation nurse. The insulin pump is a more complex method \nof continuous insulin delivery. Principles of insulin use with \nthe insulin pump are described in Box 33–1. Unless you are \nGlucose Disorders\n33\n",

It is therefore not unusual for such patients \nto require normal saline at rates of 500 mL/hr for an addi-\ntional 2 to 8 hours to restore euvolemia. If a patient has a \nhistory of congestive heart failure (CHF), weighs less than \n50 kg, or is 80 years of age or older, normal saline should \nbe given cautiously, to avoid iatrogenic CHF.\n2.\t Begin an insulin infusion. Administer a single dose of 5 \nto 10 U of IV regular insulin by direct slow injection, \nfollowed by an infusion rate that is based on close \nmonitoring of blood glucose. Start the insulin infusion \nat 0.1 U/kg/hr in normal saline.\nRegular insulin can bind to the plastic IV tubing. To ensure \naccurate insulin delivery, 30 to 50 mL of the infusion solu-\ntion should be run through the IV tubing and discarded \nbefore the tubing is connected to the patient.\nDiscontinue the standing order for SC insulin or oral \nhypoglycemics before you begin the insulin infusion.\n3.\t Monitor blood glucose level hourly by FPBG measurements. \nWhen the blood glucose level has fallen to 14 mmol/L, \ncontinue the insulin infusion, but switch the delivery \nsolution from normal saline to 5% dextrose in water \n(D5W). Continue the insulin infusion until the blood \nglucose level remains stable at 8 to 10 mmol/L. As the \nblood glucose level falls, the rate of insulin infusion \nshould be slowed (e.g., from 0.025 to 0.05 U/kg/hr).\nThe rate of fall of blood glucose level should be approxi-\nmately 2 mmol/L/hr; more aggressive treatment of hypergly-\ncemia may result in severe hypokalemia and cerebral edema.\n4.\t When the glucose level has stabilized at 8 to 10 mmol/L, \nrestart SC insulin, remembering that the insulin infusion \nmust be continued for 1 to 2 hours after the injection of \nSC insulin; otherwise, ketogenesis will be reactivated. \nContinue to monitor the bedside glucose level every \n4 hours, adding supplemental regular insulin to keep \nblood glucose between 8 and 10 mmol/L.\n5.\t Monitor blood glucose level, serum electrolyte levels, and \narterial blood gas (ABG) measurements.\nHyperglycemic patients can have metabolic acidemia and \nhypokalemia.

It is a syndrome of profound vol-\nume depletion that results from a sustained hyperglycemic \ndiuresis without compensatory fluid intake. Typical patients \nare 50 to 70 years old. Many have no history of diabetes mel-\nlitus. The precipitating event is often stroke, infection, pancre-\natitis, or drug use. The blood glucose level is often very high \n(>55 mmol/L), but significant ketosis is absent.\n1.\t Correct volume depletion and water deficit. The objec-\ntives of fluid therapy in the nonketotic hyperosmolar \nstate are to correct the volume deficit and to resolve the \nhyperosmolarity. These objectives can be achieved by \nadministering normal saline, 500 to 1000 mL intrave-\nnously over 1 to 2 hours; subsequent IV rates are guid-\ned by reassessment of volume status. Once the volume \ndeficit is corrected with normal saline, remaining water \ndeficits—as indicated by persistent hypernatremia or \nhyperglycemia—are best corrected with hypotonic IV \nsolutions, such as 1⁄2 normal saline.\n2.\t Begin an insulin infusion. See the previous discussion \nof the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Rehydration \nalone often produces a substantial fall in blood glucose \nlevel through renal excretion. As a result, patients with \nthe hyperosmolar, hyperglycemic, nonketotic state gen-\nerally require less insulin than does a patient with type \n1 diabetes and ketoacidosis.\n3.\t Monitor blood glucose and serum electrolyte levels.

      "text": "Laboratory-Related Problems: The Common Calls\n426\nRemember that when you attempt to correct disorders \nmanifested by hyponatremia, brain cells try to maintain their \nvolume in dilutional states by losing solutes (e.g., potassium). \nIf the serum sodium level is corrected too rapidly (i.e., to lev­\nels >120 to 125 mmol/L), the serum may become hypertonic \nin relation to brain cells, which results in an outward shift of \nwater and subsequent central nervous system damage caused \nby acute brain shrinkage.\nCorrect the Cause (if Possible)\nUrinary electrolyte measurements may be helpful in identi­\nfying the primary cause of hyponatremia when more than \none cause is possible. The renal response to salt and water \nloss depends on the cause of hyponatremia. When extrare­\nnal losses of sodium and water occur through the skin (e.g., \nsweating, burns) or as a result of third space losses (e.g., pan­\ncreatitis), the renal response is to conserve sodium (urine \nsodium level, <20 mmol/L) and to conserve water through \nsecretion of antidiuretic hormone (high urine osmolality). \nHowever, if volume loss results from vomiting or nasogastric \nsuction, primarily hydrochloride is lost from gastric secre­\ntions. The kidneys generate and excrete sodium bicarbonate \n(NaHCO3) to maintain the acid-base balance, which causes \nurine to have a normal level (>20 mmol/L) of sodium but a \nlow level (<20 mmol/L) of chloride. If volume loss is caused \nby diarrhea, primarily NaHCO3 is lost in the stools. The kid­\nneys generate and excrete ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) to \nmaintain the acid-base balance; as a result, urine has low lev­\nels of sodium but not of chloride.\nHyponatremia with extracellular fluid excess and edema \nmay be accompanied by a low level (<20 mmol/L) of urinary \nsodium (e.g., nephrotic syndrome, congestive heart failure, \ncirrhosis of the liver) or a normal level of urinary sodium \n(renal failure).\nAssess and Correct the Volume Status (see Chapter 3)\n1.\t If the patient has volume depletion, correct the extra­\ncellular fluid volume with normal saline.

This class of calcium \nchannel blockers is easily identified by the \nsuffix “-dipine.”\nActions:\nInhibit calcium influx through cell membranes. \nDiffer in selectivity among vascular beds.\nSide effects:\nHypotension, flushing, dizziness, constipation, \nheadaches, peripheral edema, bradycardia. The \nedema results from vasodilation and does not \nrespond to diuretics.\nComments:\nAbsorption is highly variable.
