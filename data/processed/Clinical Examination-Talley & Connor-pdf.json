      "text": "every country of the world operate under increasing cost pressures.\nThere has never been a more important time than now to have superb\nclinical skills in history taking, physical examination and synthesis of the data\ngathered. The increasing age of the population and the expansion of what\nmedicine can do for all illnesses, especially chronic disease, demands more\nand higher-quality care. Added to this demand is the re-emerging importance\nof generalist skills across all specialties of medicine, especially in primary care\nor family practice, emergency medicine, general internal medicine and general\nsurgery. The reality of being able to provide high-quality care to people\nacross metropolitan, rural and remote areas requires the knowledge and skills\nof the generalist who must, often under great time pressure, take a history\nand carry out a physical examination that will determine the next stage of\ninvestigation or treatment. Depending on the setting, there may not be much\nassistance from modern technology. These ‘old-fashioned’ skills of history\ntaking and physical examination have been given new life in recent years by\nthe information gained about their accuracy through clinical epidemiological\nresearch: evidence-based clinical evaluation.\nThe challenge for teachers of the art and science of clinical evaluation in\nthe 21st century is to make it attractive and exciting for all clinicians, but\nespecially for medical students and young doctors for whom modern\ntechnology may seem to be an alluring shortcut. In the sixth edition of their\nnow classic book, Talley and O’Connor have written an attractive and\nexciting text that is a joy to read through its clarity of expression, quality of\ninformation and engagement with the reader by commentary on historical\ndetails and practical hints. The information is made easier to comprehend,\nassimilate and remember through judicious use of diagrams and pictures.\nFinally, it has the innovation of the ‘Good signs guides’ in each chapter giving\nsnapshots of the evidence about how these clinical tests perform.\nFor over 21 years, Clinical Examination by Talley and O’Connor has\nprovided medical students, junior doctors, senior doctors and clinician\nteachers with the guidance to carry out a rational and thoughtful history and\nan organised and disciplined physical examination. The information contained\nin this book is the basis for the hypothetico-deductive process used by most\nclinicians to reach a provisional diagnosis and a parsimonious list of\ndifferential diagnoses. From the first edition in 1988 to today’s very different-\nlooking but even better sixth edition, the book has stood not only the test of\ntime but also critical appraisal by thousands of very bright people. This\ntextbook deserves its place on the shelves and in the computers of every\nmedical practitioner.\nMichael Hensley, Professor of Medicine and Dean of Medicine, School of Medicine\nand Public Health, University of Newcastle, Australia\n",

The book has been in continuous production for over 20 years\nand remains one of the most successful textbooks on examination methods in\nthe world today. We have carefully updated and revised the text and\nillustrations to meet the needs of all medical students, from beginners to\nadvanced practitioners.\nMedical education has changed radically in the last decade in many\ncountries. Various medical schools now offer post-graduate medical courses\nlasting four years; some offer both undergraduate and postgraduate courses,\nand others only train at the undergraduate level for five to six years. However\nlong the formal training, many new topics have been added to already\ncrowded courses. These changes have meant less emphasis in some\nprograms on the more basic foundations of medicine, regrettably including\nless anatomy and physiology teaching. A clinical examination textbook cannot\nteach these subjects in detail, but we have felt the need to introduce basic\nexamination anatomy into this book to assist students’ understanding of\nphysical examination. We have also added a number of anatomical drawings,\nX-rays and scans to help explain the structure of key areas being examined.\nThis edition includes expanded sections on history taking, including a\nnew chapter on advanced history taking, and important lists of differential\ndiagnoses. Features of the history that may indicate a serious or urgent\nproblem are highlighted.\nUnlike most other books teaching examination methods, we have felt it\nessential to provide references supporting important aspects of examination\nand history taking. Contemporary medical students are trained to be sceptical\nand expect evidence for assertions made by their teachers. These references\ngive students the opportunity to follow up areas that interest them in more\ndetail.\nThe latest evidence-based information on the value of various clinical\nsigns has been included. This area owes much to Professor Steven McGee,\nand we are very grateful to him for his permission to reproduce some of his\npublished data.\nThe DVD accompanying the book contains a video guide to the\nexamination of the main systems of the body. For this edition, we have\nadded a selection of examples of Objective Structured Clinical\nExaminations (OSCEs) a library of electrocardiographs (ECGs) with notes\n",

      "text": "Clinical methods: an historical perspective\n \nThe best physician is the one who is able to differentiate the possible\nand the impossible.\nHerophilus of Alexandria\n From classical Greek times interrogation of the patient has been\nconsidered most important because disease was, and still is, viewed in terms\nof the discomfort it causes. However, the current emphasis on the use of\nhistory taking and physical examination for diagnosis developed only in the\n19th century. Although the terms ‘symptoms and signs’ have been part of the\nmedical vocabulary since the revival of classical medicine, until relatively\nrecently they were used synonymously.\nDuring the 19th century, the distinction between symptoms (subjective\ncomplaints, which the clinician learns from the patient’s account of his or her\nfeelings) and signs (objective morbid changes detectable by the clinician)\nevolved.\nUntil the 19th century, diagnosis was empirical and based on the\nclassical Greek belief that all disease had a single cause, an imbalance of the\nfour humours (yellow bile, black bile, blood and phlegm). Indeed the Royal\nCollege of Physicians, founded in London in 1518, believed that clinical\nexperience without classical learning was useless, and physicians who were\nCollege members were fined if they ascribed to any other view.\nAt the time of Hippocrates (460–375 BC) observation (inspection) and\nfeeling (palpation) had a place in the examination of patients. The ancient\nGreeks, for example, noticed that patients with jaundice often had an\nenlarged liver that was firm and irregular. Shaking a patient and listening for a\nfluid splash was also recognised by the Greeks.\nHerophilus of Alexandria (335–280 BC) described a method of taking\nthe pulse in the 4th century BC. However, it was Galen of Pergamum (130–\n200 AD) who established the pulse as one of the major physical signs, and it\ncontinued to have this important role up to the 18th century, with minute\nvariations being recorded. These variations were erroneously considered to\nindicate changes in the body’s harmony.\nWilliam Harvey’s (1578–1657) studies of the human circulation,\npublished in 1628, had little effect on the general understanding of the value\nof the pulse as a sign. Sanctorius (1561–1636) was the first to time the pulse\nusing a clock, while John Floyer (1649–1734) invented the pulse watch in\n1707 and made regular observations of the pulse rate. Abnormalities in heart\nrate were described in diabetes mellitus in 1776 and in thyrotoxicosis in 1786.\nFever was studied by Hippocrates and was originally regarded as an\n",

In association with Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686–1736),\nHermann Boerhaave (1668–1738) introduced the thermometer as a research\ninstrument and this was produced commercially in the middle of the 18th\ncentury.\nIn the 13th century Johannes Actuarius (d. 1283) used a graduated glass\nto examine the urine. In Harvey’s time a specimen of urine was sometimes\nlooked at (inspected) and even tasted, and was considered to reveal secrets\nabout the body. Harvey recorded that sugar diabetes (mellitus) and dropsy\n(oedema) could be diagnosed in this way. The detection of protein in the\nurine, which Frederik Dekkers (1644–1720) first described in 1673, was\nignored until Richard Bright (1789–1858) demonstrated its importance in\nrenal disease. Although Celsus described and valued measurements such as\nweighing and measuring a patient in the 1st century AD, these methods\nbecame widely used only in the 20th century.\nA renaissance in clinical methods began with the concept of Battista\nMorgagni (1682–1771) that disease was not generalised but arose in organs, a\nconclusion published in 1761. Leopold Auenbrugger invented chest tapping\n(percussion) to detect disease in the same year. Van Swieten, his teacher, in\nfact used percussion to detect ascites. The technique was forgotten for nearly\nhalf a century until Jean Corvisart (1755–1821) translated Auenbrugger’s\nwork in 1808.\nThe next big step occurred with René Laënnec (1781–1826), a student\nof Corvisart. He invented the stethoscope in 1816 (at first merely a roll of\nstiff paper) as an aid to diagnosing heart and lung disease by listening\n(auscultation). This revolutionised chest examination, partly because it made\nthe chest accessible in patients too modest to allow a direct application of the\nexaminer’s ear to the chest wall, as well as allowing accurate\nclinicopathological correlations. William Stokes (1804–78) published the first\ntreatise in English on the use of the stethoscope in 1825. Josef Skoda’s\n(1805–81) investigations of the value of these clinical methods led to their\nwidespread and enthusiastic adoption after he published his results in 1839.\nThese advances helped lead to a change in the practice of medicine.\nBedside teaching was first introduced in the Renaissance by Montanus\n(1498–1552) in Padua in 1543. In the 17th century, physicians based their\nopinion on a history provided by an apothecary (assistant) and rarely saw the\npatients themselves. Thomas Sydenham (1624–89) began to practise more\nmodern bedside medicine, basing his treatment on experience and not theory,\nbut it was not until a century later that the scientific method brought a\nsystematic approach to clinical diagnosis.\nThis change began in the hospitals of Paris after the French Revolution,\nwith recognition of the work of Morgagni, Corvisart, Laënnec and others.\nInfluenced by the philosophy of the Enlightenment which suggested that a\n",

Later at Guy’s Hospital in\nLondon the famous trio of Richard Bright, Thomas Addison (1793–1860)\nand Thomas Hodgkin (1798–1866) made their important contributions. In\n1869 Samuel Wilks (1824–1911) wrote on the nail changes in disease and the\nsigns he described remain important. Carl Wunderlich’s (1815–77) work\nchanged the concept of temperature from a disease in itself to a symptom of\ndisease.\nSpectacular advances in physiology, pathology, pharmacology and the\ndiscovery of microbiology in the latter half of the 19th century led to the\ndevelopment of the new ‘clinical and laboratory medicine’, which is the\nrapidly advancing medicine of the present day. The modern systematic\napproach to diagnosis, with which this book deals, is still, however, based on\ntaking the history and examining the patient by looking (inspecting), feeling\n(palpating), tapping (percussing) and listening (auscultating).\nSuggested reading\n \nReiser SJ.

In all branches of medicine, the development of a rational plan\nof management depends on a correct diagnosis or sensible, differential\ndiagnosis (list of possible diagnoses). Except for patients who are extremely\nill, taking a careful medical history should precede both examination and\ntreatment. A medical history is the first step in making a diagnosis; it will\noften help direct the physical examination and will usually determine what\ninvestigations are appropriate. More often than not, an accurate history\nsuggests the correct diagnosis, whereas the physical examination and\nsubsequent investigations merely serve to confirm this impression.1,2 The\nhistory is also, of course, the least expensive way of making a diagnosis.\nChanges in medical education mean that much student teaching is now\nconducted away from the traditional hospital ward.

      "text": "how to take a thorough medical history, but obviously adjustments to the\ntechnique must be made for patients seen in busy surgeries or outpatient\ndepartments. Much information about a patient’s previous medical history\nmay already be available in hospital or clinic records; the detail needed will\nvary depending on the complexity of the presenting problem and whether the\nvisit is a follow-up or a new consultation. All students must, however, have a\ncomprehensive understanding of how to take a complete medical history.\nBedside manner and establishing rapport\n \nHistory taking requires practice and depends very much on the doctor–\npatient relationship.3 It is important to try to put the patient at ease\nimmediately, because unless a rapport is established, the history taking is\nlikely to be unrewarding.\nThere is no doubt that the treatment of a patient begins the moment one\nreaches the bedside or the patient enters the consulting rooms. The patient’s\nfirst impressions of a doctor’s professional manner will have a lasting effect.\nOne of the axioms of the medical profession is primum non nocere (the first\nthing is to cause no harm).4 An unkind and thoughtless approach to\nquestioning and examining a patient can cause harm before any treatment has\nhad the opportunity to do so. You should aim to leave the patient feeling\nbetter for your visit. This is a difficult technique to teach. Much has been\nwritten about the correct way to interview patients, but each doctor has to\ndevelop his or her own method, guided by experience gained from clinical\nteachers and patients.5-8\nTo help establish this good relationship, the student or doctor must\nmake a deliberate point of introducing him- or herself and explaining his or\nher role. This is especially relevant for students or junior doctors seeing\npatients in hospital. A student might say: ‘Good afternoon, Mrs Evans. My\nname is Jane Smith; I am Dr Osler’s medical student. She has asked me to\ncome and see you.’ A patient seen at a clinic should be asked to come and sit\ndown, and be directed to a chair. The door should be shut or, if the patient is\nin the ward, the curtains drawn to give some privacy. The clinician should sit\ndown beside or near the patient so as to be close to eye level and give the\nimpression that the interview will be an unhurried one.9,10 It is important here\nto address the patient respectfully and use his or her name and title. Some\ngeneral remarks about the weather, hospital food or the crowded waiting\nroom may be appropriate to help put the patient at ease, but these must not\nbe patronising.\nObtaining the history\n",

However, many clinicians find it useful to make rough notes\nduring the interview. With practice this can be done without loss of rapport.\nIn fact, pausing to make a note of a patient’s answer to a question suggests\nthat it is being taken seriously.\nMany clinics and hospitals use computer records which may be\ndisplayed on a computer screen on the desk. Notes are sometimes added to\nthese during the interview via a keyboard. It can be very off-putting for a\npatient when the interviewing doctor looks entirely at the computer screen\nrather than at the patient. With practice it is possible to enter data while\nmaintaining eye contact with a patient, but at first it is probably preferable in\nmost cases to make written notes and transcribe them later.\nThe final record must be a sequential, accurate account of the\ndevelopment and course of the illness or illnesses of the patient (Appendix I,\npage 461). There are a number of methods of recording this information.\nHospitals may have printed forms with spaces for recording specific\ninformation. This applies especially to routine admissions (e.g. for minor\nsurgical procedures). Follow-up consultation questions and notes will be\nbriefer than those of the initial consultation; obviously, many questions are\nonly relevant for the initial consultation. When a patient is seen repeatedly at\na clinic or in a general practice setting, the current presenting history may be\nlisted as an ‘active’ problem and the past history as a series of ‘inactive’ or\n‘still active’ problems.\nA sick patient will sometimes emphasise irrelevant facts and forget about\nvery important symptoms. For this reason, a systematic approach to history\ntaking and recording is crucial (Table 1.1).11\nTable 1.1 History-taking sequence\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1 Presenting (principal) symptom (PS)\n2 History of presenting illness (HPI)\nDetails of current illnesses\n",

Asking the patient ‘What\nbrought you here today?’ can be unwise, as it often promotes the reply ‘an\nambulance’ or ‘a car’. This little joke wears thin after some years in clinical\npractice. It is best to attempt a conversational approach and ask the patient\n‘What has been the trouble or problem recently?’ or ‘When were you last\nquite well?’ For a follow-up consultation some reference to the last visit is\nappropriate, for example: ‘How have things been going since I saw you last?’\nor ‘It’s about … weeks since I saw you last, isn’t it? What’s been happening\nsince then?’ This lets the patient know the clinician hasn’t forgotten him or\nher. Some writers suggest the clinician begin with questions to the patient\nabout more general aspects of his or her life. There is a danger that this\nattempt to establish early rapport will seem intrusive to a person who has\ncome for help about a specific problem, albeit one related to other aspects of\nhis or her life. This type of general and personal information may be better\napproached once the clinician has shown an interest in the presenting\nproblem or as part of the social history. The best approach and timing of this\npart of the interview must vary, depending on the nature of the presenting\nproblem and the patient’s and clinician’s attitude. Encourage patients to tell\ntheir story in their own words from the onset of the first symptom to the\npresent time.\nWhen a patient stops volunteering information, the question ‘What\nelse?’ may start things up again.8 However, some direction may be necessary\nto keep a garrulous patient on track later during the interview. It is necessary\nto ask specific questions to test diagnostic hypotheses. For example, the\npatient may not have noticed an association between the occurrence of chest\ndiscomfort and exercise (typical of angina) unless asked specifically. It may\nalso be helpful to give a list of possible answers. A patient with suspected\nangina who is unable to describe the symptom may be asked if the sensation\nwas sharp, dull, heavy or burning. The reply that it was burning makes\nangina less likely.\nAppropriate (but not exaggerated) reassuring gestures are of value to\nmaintain the flow of conversation. If the patient stops giving the story\nspontaneously, it can be useful to provide a short summary of what has\nalready been said and encourage him or her to continue.\nThe clinician must learn to listen with an open mind.10 The temptation\nto leap to a diagnostic decision before the patient has had the chance to\n",

Avoid\nusing pseudo-medical terms; and if the patient uses these, find out exactly\nwhat is meant by them, as misinterpretation of medical terms is common.\nPatients’ descriptions of their symptoms may vary as they are subjected\nto repeated questioning by increasingly senior medical staff. The patient who\nhas described his chest pain as sharp and left-sided to the medical student\nmay tell the registrar that the pain is dull and in the centre of the chest. These\ndiscrepancies come as no surprise to experienced clinicians; they are\nsometimes the result of the patient’s having had time to reflect on his or her\nsymptoms. This does mean, however, that very important aspects of the\nstory should be checked by asking follow-up questions, such as: ‘Can you\nshow me exactly where the pain is?’ and ‘What do you mean by sharp?’\nSome patients may have medical problems that make the interview\ndifficult for them; these include deafness and problems with speech and\nmemory. These must be recognised by the clinician if the interview is to be\nsuccessful. See Chapter 2 for more details.\nThe presenting (principal) symptom\n \nNot uncommonly, a patient has many symptoms. An attempt must be made\nto decide which symptom led the patient to present. It must be remembered\nthat the patient’s and the doctor’s ideas of what constitutes a serious problem\nmay differ. A patient with symptoms of a cold who also, in passing, mentions\nthat he has recently had severe crushing retrosternal chest pain needs more\nattention to his heart than to his nose. Record each presenting symptom in\nthe patient’s own words, avoiding technical terms.\nHistory of the presenting illness\n \nEach of the presenting problems has to be talked about in detail with the\npatient, but in the first part of the interview the patient should lead the\ndiscussion. In the second part the doctor should take more control and ask\nspecific questions. When writing down the history of the presenting illness,\nthe events should be placed in chronological order; this might have to be\ndone later when the whole history has been obtained.

Sudden loss\nof consciousness (syncope) with immediate recovery occurs with cardiac but\nnot neurological disease. Ask whether the symptom has been present\ncontinuously or intermittently. Determine if the symptom is getting worse or\nbetter, and, if so, when the change occurred. For example, the exertional\nbreathlessness of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may come on with\nless and less activity as it worsens.

If the patient complains of dizziness, does this mean\nthe room spins around (vertigo) or is it more a feeling of light-headedness?\nDoes indigestion mean abdominal pain, heartburn, excess wind or a change in\nbowel habit? If there is pain, is it sharp, dull, stabbing, boring, burning or\ncramp-like?\nRadiation of pain or discomfort\n \nDetermine whether the symptom, if localised, radiates; this mainly applies if\nthe symptom is pain. Certain patterns of radiation are typical of a condition\nor even diagnostic, e.g. the nerve root distribution of pain associated with\nherpes zoster (shingles).\nAlleviating factors\n \nAsk whether anything makes the symptom better. For example, the pain of\npericarditis may be relieved when a patient sits up. Have analgesic\nmedications been used to control the pain? Have narcotics been required?\nTiming\n \nFind out when the symptom first began and try to date this as accurately as\npossible. For example, ask the patient what was the first thing he or she\nnoticed that was ‘unusual’ or ‘wrong’. Ask whether the patient has had a\nsimilar illness in the past. It is often helpful to ask patients when they last felt\nentirely well. In a patient with long-standing symptoms, ask why he or she\ndecided to come and see the doctor at this time.\nExacerbating factors\n \nAsk if anything makes the pain or symptom worse.

Severity can\nbe graded from mild to very severe. A mild symptom can be ignored by the\npatient, while a moderate symptom cannot be ignored but does not interfere\nwith daily activities. A severe symptom interferes with daily activities, while a\nvery severe symptom markedly interferes with most activities. Alternatively,\npain or discomfort can be graded on a 10-point scale from 0 (no discomfort)\nto 10 (unbearable).\nThe severity of some symptoms can be quantified more precisely; for\nexample, shortness of breath on exertion occurring after walking 10 metres\non flat ground is more severe than shortness of breath occurring after walking\n90 metres up a hill.

Then ask the patient to\nshow you all his or her medications, if possible, and list them. Note the dose,\nlength of use, and the indication for each drug. This list may provide a useful\nclue to chronic or past illnesses, otherwise forgotten. Remember that some\ndrugs are prescribed as transdermal patches or subcutaneous implants (e.g.\ncontraceptives and hormonal treatment of carcinoma of the prostate). Ask\nwhether the drugs were taken as prescribed. Always ask specifically whether\na woman is taking the contraceptive pill, because this is not considered a\nmedicine or tablet by many who take it. The same is true of inhalers, or what\nmany patients call their ‘puffers’.\nTo remind the patient, it is often useful to ask about the use of classes\nof drugs. A basic list should include questions about treatment for blood\npressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, arthritis, anxiety or depression,\nimpotence, contraception, hormone replacement, epilepsy, anticoagulation\nand the use of antibiotics. Also ask the patient if he or she is taking any over-\nthe-counter preparations (e.g. aspirin, antihistamines, vitamins). Aspirin and\nstandard non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but not\nparacetamol, can cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with chronic pain\nmay consume large amounts of analgesics, including drugs containing opioids\nsuch as codeine or morphine. A careful history of the period of use of opioids\nand the quantities used is important because they are drugs of dependence.\nApproximately 50% of people now use ‘natural remedies’ of various\ntypes. They may not feel these are a relevant part of their medical history,\nbut these chemicals, like any drug, may have adverse effects. Indeed, some\nof these have been found to be adulterated with drugs such as steroids and\nNSAIDs. More information about these substances and their effects is\nbecoming available and there is an increasing responsibility for clinicians to be\naware of them.\nThere may be some medications or treatments the patient has had in the\npast which remain relevant. These include corticosteroids, chemotherapeutic\nagents (anti-cancer drugs) and radiotherapy.

Also ask specifically about any\nallergy to drugs (often a skin reaction or episode of bronchospasm) and\nwhat the allergic reaction actually involved, to help judge if it was really an\nallergic reaction.12 The patient often confuses an allergy with a side-effect of\na drug.\nAsk about ‘recreational’ drug use. The use of intravenous drugs has\nmany implications for the patient’s health. Ask whether any attempt has been\nmade to avoid sharing needles. This may protect against the injection of\nviruses, but not against bacterial infection from the use of impure substances.\nNot all medical problems are treated with drugs. Ask about courses of\nphysiotherapy or rehabilitation for musculoskeletal problems or injuries, or to\nhelp recovery following surgery or a severe illness. Certain gastrointestinal\nconditions are treated with dietary supplements (e.g. pancreatic enzymes for\nchronic pancreatitis) or restrictions (e.g. of gluten for coeliac disease).\nMenstrual history\n \nFor women, a menstrual history should be obtained; it is particularly relevant\nfor a patient with abdominal pain, a suspected endocrine disease or\ngenitourinary symptoms. Write down the date of the last menstrual period.\nAsk about the age at which menstruation began, if the periods are regular, or\nwhether menopause has occurred. Ask if the symptoms are related to the\nperiods. Do not forget to ask a woman of childbearing age if there is a\npossibility of pregnancy; this, for example, may preclude the use of certain\ninvestigations or drugs.13 Observing the well-known axiom that ‘every\nwoman of childbearing years is pregnant until proven otherwise’ can prevent\nunnecessary danger to the unborn child and avoid embarrassment for the\nunwary clinician.

How has he or she coped so far, and what are\nthe patient’s expectations and hopes for the future with regard to health?\nWhat explanations of the condition has the patient been given or obtained\n(e.g. from the internet)?\nHelping a patient manage ill-health is a large part of the clinician’s duty.\nThis depends on sympathetic and realistic explanations of the probable future\ncourse of the disease and the effects of treatment.\nThe past history\n \nAsk the patient whether he or she has had any serious illnesses, operations or\nadmissions to hospital in the past. Don’t forget to inquire about childhood\nillnesses and any obstetric or gynaecological problems. Previous illnesses or\noperations may have a direct bearing on the current health of the patient. It is\nworth asking specifically about certain operations that have a continuing\neffect on the patient’s health; for example, operations for malignancy, bowel\nsurgery or cardiac surgery—especially valve surgery. Implanted prostheses\nare common in surgical, orthopaedic and cardiac procedures. These may\ninvolve a risk of infection of the foreign body, while magnetic metals—\nespecially cardiac pacemakers—are a contraindication to magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI). Chronic kidney disease may be a contraindication to X-rays\nusing iodine contrast materials and MRI scanning using gadolinium contrast.\nPregnancy is usually a contraindication to radiation exposure (X-rays and\nnuclear scans—remember that CT scans cause hundreds of times the\nradiation exposure of simple X-rays).\nThe patient may believe that he or she has had a particular diagnosis\nmade in the past, but careful questioning may reveal this as unlikely. For\nexample, the patient may mention a previous duodenal ulcer, but not have\nhad any investigations or treatment for it, which makes the diagnosis less\ncertain. Therefore it is important to obtain the particulars of each relevant\npast illness, including the symptoms experienced, tests performed and\ntreatments prescribed.\nPatients with chronic illnesses such as diabetes mellitus will probably\nhave had their condition managed with the help of various doctors and at\nspecialised clinics where diabetic educators, nurses and dieticians will have\nhad a primary role in management of the illness. Find out what supervision\nand treatment these have provided. For example, who does the patient\ncontact if there is a problem with the insulin dose, and does the patient know\nwhat to do (an action plan) if there is an urgent or dangerous complication?\nPatients with chronic diseases are often very much involved in their own care\nand are very well informed about aspects of their treatment.

In a glass of wine, a nip (or shot) of spirits, a glass of port or\nsherry, or a 200 mL (7 oz) glass of beer, there are approximately 8–10 g of\nalcohol (1 unit = 8 g). In the UK, the current recommended safe limits are 21\nunits (168 g of ethanol) a week for men and 14 units (112 g of ethanol) for\nwomen; weekly consumption of more than 50 units for men and 35 units for\nwomen defines a high-risk group. Alcohol becomes a major risk factor for\nliver disease in men if more than 80 g and in women if more than 40 g are\ntaken daily for 5 years or longer. The National Health & Medical Research\nCouncil (NHMRC) in Australia recommends a maximum alcohol intake of no\nmore than 40 g per day for males on average (and 20 g per day for females)\nwith two alcohol-free days a week. Alcoholics are notoriously unreliable\nabout describing their alcohol intake, so it may be important to suspend belief\nand sometimes (with the patient’s permission) talk to the relatives.\nCertain questions can be helpful in making a diagnosis of alcoholism;\nthese are referred to as the CAGE questions:15\n1.

(In Chapter 2, some advice on how to take the history in more\nchallenging circumstances is considered.) This type of information will help\nyou plan the diagnostic investigations and treatment, and to discuss the\nfindings with, or present them to, a colleague if necessary (see page 462).\nFirst, however, a comprehensive and systematic physical examination is\nrequired.\nThese skills can be obtained and maintained only by practice.\nReferences\n \n1.

This usually\nstarts as a long and ill-defined mental list in the mind of the doctor. As more\ndetail of the symptoms emerges, the list becomes more defined. This mental\nlist must be used as a guide to further questioning in the later part of the\ninterview. Specific questions should then be used to help confirm or eliminate\nvarious possibilities. The physical examination and investigations may then be\ndirected to help further narrow the differential. At the end of the history and\nexamination, a likely diagnosis and list of differential diagnoses should be\ndrawn up. This will often be modified as results of tests emerge.\nThis method of history taking is called, rather grandly, the hyopthetico-\ndeductive approach.

For example, the\nsudden occurrence of breathlessness in an asthmatic who has had surgery\nthis week is more likely to be due to a worsening of asthma than to a\npulmonary embolism, but an embolism must be considered because of its\nurgent seriousness.

Anxiety and\ndepression commonly present with many somatic symptoms.\n4. Is the patient trying to tell me about something more than these\nsymptoms alone?\nApparently trivial symptoms may be worrying to the patient because of\nan underlying anxiety about something else. Asking ‘What is it that has made\nyou concerned about these problems now?’ or ‘Is there anything else you\nwant to talk about?’ may help to clarify this aspect. Ask the patient ‘What\nelse?’ as natural breaks occur in the conversation.\nPersonal history taking\n \nCertain aspects of history taking go beyond routine questioning about\nsymptoms.

With time you will gain confidence in dealing\nwith patients whose medical, psychiatric or cultural situation makes standard\nquestioning difficult or impossible.5,6\nMost illnesses are upsetting, and can induce feelings of anxiety or\ndepression. On the other hand, patients with primary psychiatric illnesses\noften present with physical rather than psychological symptoms. This brain–\nbody interaction is bidirectional, and this must be understood as you obtain\nthe story.\nDiscussion of sensitive issues may actually be therapeutic in some\ncases. ‘Sympathetic confrontation’ can be helpful in some situations.

Here, gaining the patient’s\nconfidence is critical. Although this type of history taking can be difficult, it\ncan also be the most satisfying of all interviews, since interviewing can be\ndirectly therapeutic for the patient.\nAny medical illness may affect the psychological status of a patient.\nMoreover, pre-existing psychological factors may influence the way a\nmedical problem presents. Psychiatric disease can also present with medical\nsymptoms. Therefore, an essential part of the history-taking process is to\nobtain information about psychological distress and the mental state. A\nsympathetic, unhurried approach using open-ended questions will provide\nmuch information that can then be systematically recorded after the\ninterview.\nIt is important for the history taker to maintain an objective demeanour,\nparticularly when asking about delicate subjects such as sexual problems,\ngrief reactions or abuse. It is not the clinician’s role to appear judgmental\nabout patients or their lives.\nThe formal psychological or psychiatric interview differs from general\nmedical history taking.

The patient’s permission should be sought\nbefore questions of this sort are asked. This request should include some\nexplanation as to why the questions are necessary.7\nA sexual history is most relevant if there is presentation with a urethral\ndischarge, painful urination (dysuria), vaginal discharge, a genital ulcer or\nrash, abdominal pain, pain on intercourse (dyspareunia), or anorectal\nsymptoms, or if human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis are\nsuspected.8\nAsk about the last date of intercourse, number of contacts, homosexual\nor bisexual partners, and contacts with sex workers. The type of sexual\npractice may also be important: for example, oroanal contact may predispose\nto colonic infection, and rectal contact to hepatitis B or C, or HIV.\nIt is also often relevant to ask diplomatic and ‘matter of fact’ questions\nabout a history of sexual abuse. One way to start is: ‘You may have heard\nthat some people have been sexually or physically victimised, and this can\naffect their illness. Has this ever happened to you?’ Such events may have\nimportant and long-lasting physical and psychological effects.9\nAccurate answers to some of these questions may not be obtained until\nthe patient has had a number of consultations and has developed trust in the\ntreating doctor. If an answer seems unconvincing, it may be reasonable to\nask the question again at a later stage.\nCross-cultural history taking\n \nIf the patient’s first language is not the same as yours, he or she may find the\nmedical interview very difficult.

Some patients may be embarrassed to discuss\nmedical problems in front of a relative, and relatives are often tempted to\nexplain (or change) the patient’s answers instead of just translating them.\nProfessional translators are trained to avoid this and can often provide\nsimultaneous and accurate translation, but not all patients feel comfortable\nwith a third person present. It is important to continue to make eye contact\nwith the patient while asking questions, even though it will be the interpreter\nwho responds; otherwise the patient may feel left out of the discussion.\nQuestions should be directed as if going straight to the patient: ‘Have you had\nany problems with shortness of breath?’ rather than ‘Has he had any\nbreathlessness?’ It always takes longer to interview a patient using an\ninterpreter, and more time should be allowed for the consultation.\nIt is alarmingly common for relatives who accompany patients to\ninterrupt and contradict the patient’s version of events even when they are\nnot acting as translators. The interposition of a relative between the clinician\nand the patient always makes the history taking less direct and the patient’s\nsymptoms more subject to ‘filtering’ or interpretation before the information\nreaches the clinician. Try tactfully to direct relatives to let the patient answer\nin his or her own words.\nAttitudes to illness and disease vary in different cultures. Problems\nconsidered shameful by the patient may be very difficult for him or her to\ndiscuss. In some cultures (and increasingly in Australia), women may object\nto being questioned or examined by male doctors or students. Male students\nmay need to be accompanied by a female chaperone for even the interview\nwith sensitive female patients, and certainly should have one during the\nphysical examination of the patient. It is most important that cultural\nsensitivities on either side are not allowed to prevent a thorough medical\nassessment.\nAboriginal patients may have a large extended family. These relatives\nmay be able to provide invaluable support to the patient, but their own\nmedical or social problems may interfere with the patient’s ability to manage\nhis or her own health. Commitments to family members may make it difficult\nfor the patient to come to medical appointments or to travel for specialist\ntreatment. Detailed questioning about family contacts and responsibilities may\nhelp with the planning of the patient’s treatment.\nRecent concepts in indigenous health care include the notions of cultural\nawareness, cultural sensitivity and cultural safety.11,12 Cultural awareness\ncan be thought of as the first step towards understanding the rituals, beliefs,\ncustoms and practices of a culture. Cultural sensitivity means accepting the\nimportance and roles of these differences.

You as a\nclinician need to be impartial and objective. Students may need to discuss\nspecific problems with members of the medical faculty and find out what the\nuniversity and hospital policies are on these matters.\nThe ‘uncooperative’ or ‘difficult’ patient and the history\n \nMost clinical encounters are a cooperative effort on the part of the patient\nand clinician. The patient wants help to find out what is wrong and to get\nbetter. This should make the meeting satisfying and friendly for both parties.\nHowever, interviews do not always run smoothly. 13 Resentment may occur\non both sides if the patient seems not to be taking the doctor’s advice\nseriously, or will not cooperate with attempts at history taking or\nexamination. Unless there is a serious psychiatric or neurological problem that\nimpairs the patient’s judgment, taking or not taking advice remains his or her\nprerogative. The clinician’s role is to give advice and explanation, not to\ndictate. Indeed, it must be realised that the advice may not always be correct.\nKeeping this in mind will help prevent that most unsatisfactory and\nunprofessional of outcomes—becoming angry with the patient.\nThis approach, however, must not be an excuse for not providing a\nproper, sympathetic and thorough explanation of the problem and the\nconsequences of ignoring medical advice, to the extent that the patient will\nallow. A clinician whose advice is rarely accepted should begin to wonder\nabout his or her clinical acumen.\nPatients who are aggressive and uncooperative may have a medical\nreason for their behaviour. The possibilities to be considered include alcohol\nor drug withdrawal, an intracranial lesion such as a tumour or subdural\nhaematoma, or a psychiatric disease such as paranoid schizophrenia. In other\ncases, resentment at the occurrence of illness may be the problem.\nSome patients may seem difficult because they are too cooperative.\nThe patient concerned about his blood pressure may have brought printouts\nof his own blood pressure measurements at half-hour intervals for several\nweeks. It is important to show restrained interest in these recordings, without\nencouraging excessive enthusiasm in the patient. Other patients may bring\nwith them information about their symptoms or a diagnosis obtained from the\ninternet. It is important to remember, and perhaps point out, that information\nobtained in this way may not have been subjected to any form of peer\nreview. People with chronic illnesses, on the other hand, may know more\nabout their conditions than their medical attendants.\nSometimes the interests of the patient and the doctor are not the same.\n",

Is there a history of inherited diseases, e.g. a family history of sudden death?\n \nAsk about screening tests being done for any serious illnesses, such as\nmammograms for breast cancer, Pap smears for cervical cancer or\ncolonoscopy for colon cancer.\nThe first interview with a patient is an opportunity to make an\nassessment of the known risk factors for a number of important medical\nconditions. Even when the patient has come about an unconnected problem,\nthere is often the opportunity for a quick review. Constant matter-of-fact\nreminding about these can make a great difference to the way people protect\nthemselves from ill-health.\nThe patient’s awareness and understanding of these basic measures for\nmaintaining good health can be assessed throughout the interview. Even\nwhen they are unrelated to the presenting problem, serious examples of risky\nbehaviour should be pointed out. This should not be done in an aggressive\nway. For example, you might say: ‘This might be a good time to make a big\neffort to give up smoking, because it’s especially unwise for someone like\nyou with a family history of heart disease.’\nCertain questions can be helpful in making a diagnosis of alcoholism;\nthese are referred to as the CAGE questions (see Chapter 1). Another\napproach is to ask, ‘Have you ever had a drinking problem?’ and ‘Did you\nhave your last drink within the last 24 hours?’ The patient who answers ‘yes’\nto both questions is likely to be a high-risk drinker.\nThe patient’s vaccination record should be reviewed regularly and\n",

Perform\na mini-mental examination (refer to Chapter 12) and record the score.\nSpecific problems in the elderly\n \nFalls and loss of balance are common and dangerous for these patients. Hip\nfractures and head injuries are life-threatening events. Ask about falls and\nnear-falls. Does the patient use a stick or a frame? Are there hazards in the\nhouse that increase the risk (e.g. steep and narrow stairs)? The use of\nsedatives like sleeping tablets or anti-anxiety (anxiolytic) drugs and of some\nanti-hypertensive drugs increases falls risk and must be assessed.\nScreening for osteoporosis is recommended for all women over 65 years\nand all men 70 and older. Risk factors for osteoporosis include being\nunderweight, heavy alcohol use, use of corticosteroids or early menopause,\nor a history of previous fractures.\nGeneral questions about mobility should also include asking about\nreasons for immobility.

The starting point of the differential diagnosis of a certain symptom is\nthe likelihood (or probability) that a certain condition will occur in this\nperson. Most clinicians still rely on their own experience when making this\nassessment, although some information of disease prevalence in different\npopulations is becoming available. Unfortunately, one person’s experience is\na relatively small sample, and past experience may bias the clinician in favour\nof or against a certain diagnosis.\nSome diagnoses may largely be excluded from the differential diagnosis\nlist at once. This may be based, for example, on the patient’s age, sex or race\nor the extreme rarity of the disease in a particular country. For example,\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease would be very unlikely in a 20-year-\nold non-smoker who presents with breathlessness.\nThe differential diagnosis is gradually narrowed as more information\nabout the patient’s symptoms comes from the patient directly, and as a result\nof specific questioning about features of the symptoms that will help to refine\nthe list.\nA symptom typical of a certain condition will increase the likelihood of\nthe diagnosis by a certain percentage. If the prevalence of the condition is\nalready high, a high likelihood ratio (LR) should bring that condition towards\nthe top of the differential list. For example, a patient’s description of ‘typical\nangina’ has a strong LR of 5.8 for the diagnosis of significant coronary artery\ndisease. This would make the diagnosis highly likely in a patient from a\npopulation with a high prevalence of coronary disease (e.g. a man over the\nage of 50 with typical anginal chest pain) but still very unlikely in someone\nfrom a very low risk population (e.g. a 19-year-old woman).

The clinician should explain how the symptoms and any\nexamination findings relate to the diagnosis. For example, if a patient presents\nwith dyspnoea, the clinician should begin by saying, ‘I believe your shortness\nof breath is probably the result of pneumonia, but there are a few other\npossibilities’. The complexity of the explanation will depend on the clinician’s\nunderstanding of the patient’s ability to follow any technical aspects of the\ndiagnosis. The patient’s desire for a detailed explanation is also variable, and\nthis must be taken into account.\nIf the diagnosis is fairly definite, then the prognosis and the implications\nof this must be outlined. A serious diagnosis must be discussed frankly but\nalways in the context of the variability of outcome for most medical\nconditions and the benefits of correct treatment.

For example, ‘It is\nimportant for you to realise that this is a life-threatening illness which needs\nurgent treatment.’ Patients who seem unable to accept advice of this sort\nshould be offered a chance to discuss the matter with another doctor or with\ntheir family. This must be done sympathetically: ‘This is obviously a difficult\ntime for you. Would you like me to arrange for you to see someone for\nanother opinion about it? Or would you like to come back with some of your\nfamily to talk about it again?’ The patient’s response should be carefully\ndocumented in the notes.\nPatients may need to be cautioned about certain activities until the\ncondition is treated. For example, a patient with a possible first epileptic\nseizure must be told that he or she may not legally drive a motor vehicle.\nConcluding the interview\n \nAfter talking to the patient about the assessment and prognosis, the need for\ninvestigations and any urgency involved should be discussed.

Patients must at least\nknow what dangerous symptoms should lead to immediate cessation of the\ndrug. Pharmacies often provide patients with long and unedited lists of\npossible adverse effects when they dispense drugs.

Dealing with this difficult area takes time and experience.\nThere is no shame in telling a patient you will look up possible side-\neffects and interactions of a drug before you prescribe it or if a patient\nexpresses concern about it.

      "text": "The general principles of physical examination\n \nMore mistakes are made from want of a proper examination than for\nany other reason.\nRussell John Howard (1875–1942)\n Students beginning their training in physical examination will be\nsurprised at the formal way this examination is taught and performed.1,2\nThere are, however, a number of reasons for this formal approach. The first\nis that it ensures the examination is thorough and that important signs are not\noverlooked because of a haphazard method.3 The second is that the most\nconvenient methods of examining patients in bed, and for particular\nconditions in various other postures, have evolved with time. By convention,\npatients are usually examined from the right side of the bed, even though this\nmay be more convenient only for right-handed people. When students learn\nthis, they often feel safer standing on the left side of the bed with their\ncolleagues in tutorial groups, but many tutors are aware of this device,\nparticularly when they notice all students standing as far away from the right\nside of the bed as possible.\nIt should be pointed out here that there is only limited evidence-based\ninformation concerning the validity of clinical signs. Many parts of the\nphysical examination are performed as a matter of tradition. As students\ndevelop their examination skills, experience and new evidence-based data will\nhelp them refine their use of examination techniques. We have included\ninformation about the established usefulness of signs where it is available, but\nhave also included signs that students will be expected to know about despite\ntheir unproven value.\nFor clinical viva voce (with live voice) examinations and objective\nstructured clinical examinations (OSCEs), the examiners expect all candidates\nto have a polished and thorough examination method.\nThis formal approach to the physical examination leads to the\nexamination of the parts of the body by body system. For example,\nexamination of the cardiovascular system, which includes the heart and all\nthe major accessible blood vessels, begins with positioning the patient\ncorrectly. This is followed by a quick general inspection and then, rather\nsurprisingly for the uninitiated, seemingly prolonged study of the patient’s\nfingernails. From there, a set series of manoeuvres brings the doctor to the\nheart. This type of approach applies to all major systems, and is designed to\ndiscover peripheral signs of disease in the system under scrutiny. The\nattention of the examining doctor is directed particularly towards those\n",

      "text": "attention of the examining doctor is directed particularly towards those\nsystems identified in the history as possibly being diseased, but of course\nproper physical examination requires that all the systems be examined.\nThe danger of a systematic approach is that time is not taken to stand\nback and look at the patient’s general appearance, which may give many\nclues to the diagnosis. Doctors must be observant, like a detective (Conan\nDoyle based his character Sherlock Holmes on an outstanding Scottish\nsurgeon).4 Taking the time to make an appraisal of the patient’s general\nappearance, including the face, hands and body, conveys the impression to\nthe patient (and to the examiners) that the doctor or student is interested in\nthe person as much as the disease. This general appraisal usually occurs at\nthe bedside when patients are in hospital, but for patients seen in the\nconsulting room it should begin as the patient walks into the room and during\nthe history taking, and continue at the start of the physical examination.\nDiagnosis has been defined as ‘the crucial process that labels patients\nand classifies their illnesses, that identifies (and sometimes seals) their likely\nfates or prognoses and that propels us towards specific treatments in the\nconfidence (often unfounded) that they will do more good than harm’.5\nIn normal clinical practice, the detail of the physical examination\nperformed will be ‘targeted’ and will depend on clues from the history and\nwhether the consultation is a follow-up or new consultation. Students\nhowever must know how to perform a complete examination of the body\nsystems even though they will not often perform this in practice (except\nperhaps during examinations).\nFirst impressions\n \nFirst impressions of a patient’s condition must be deliberately sought; they\ncannot be passively acquired. Make a conscious point of assessing the\npatient’s general condition right at the start. The specific changes that occur\nin particular illnesses (e.g. myxoedema) will be discussed in detail in the\nappropriate chapters. However, certain abnormalities should be obvious to\nthe trained or training doctor.\nFirst, decide how sick the patient seems to be: that is, does he or she\nlook generally ill or well? The cheerful person sitting up in bed reading Proust\n(Figure 3.1) is unlikely to require urgent attention to save his life. At the other\nextreme, the patient on the verge of death may be described as in extremis or\nmoribund. The patient in this case may be lying still in bed and seem\nunaware of the surroundings. The face may be sunken and expressionless,\nrespiration may be shallow and laboured; at the end of life, respiration often\nbecomes slow and intermittent, with longer and longer pauses between\nrattling breaths.\n",

It then causes yellow\ndiscoloration of the skin (jaundice) and, more dramatically, the apparent\ndiscoloration of the sclerae. The usual term scleral icterus is misleading,\nsince the bilirubin is actually deposited in the vascular conjunctiva rather than\nthe avascular sclerae. The sclerae (conjunctivae) are rarely affected by other\npigment changes. In fact, jaundice is the only condition causing yellow\nsclerae. Other causes of yellow discoloration of the skin, but where the\nsclerae remain normal, are carotenaemia (usually due to excess consumption\nof carotene, often from intemperate eating of carrots or mangoes),\nacriflavine, fluorescein and picric acid ingestion.\nJaundice may be the result of excess production of bilirubin, usually\nfrom excessive destruction of red blood cells (termed haemolytic anaemia),\nwhen it can produce a pale lemon-yellow scleral discoloration. Alternatively,\njaundice may be due to obstruction to bile flow from the liver, which, if\nsevere, produces a dark yellow or orange tint. Scratch marks may be\nprominent due to associated itching (pruritus). The other main cause of\njaundice is hepatocellular failure. Gilbert’s disease is also a common cause of\njaundice. It causes a mild elevation of unconjugated bilirubin and is due to an\ninherited enzyme deficiency that limits bilirubin conjugation; it has a benign\nprognosis.\nJaundice is discussed in detail in Chapter 6.\nCyanosis\n \nThis refers to a blue discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes; it is\ndue to the presence of deoxygenated haemoglobin in superficial blood\nvessels. The haemoglobin molecule changes colour from blue to red when\noxygen is added to it in the lungs. If more than about 50 g/L of deoxygenated\nhaemoglobin is present in the capillary blood, the skin will have a bluish\ntinge.7 Cyanosis does not occur in anaemic hypoxia because the total\nhaemoglobin content is low. Cyanosis is more easily detected in fluorescent\nlight than in daylight.\nCentral cyanosis means that there is an abnormal amount of\ndeoxygenated haemoglobin in the arteries and that a blue discoloration is\npresent in parts of the body with a good circulation, such as the tongue. This\nmust be distinguished from peripheral cyanosis, which occurs when the\nblood supply to a certain part of the body is reduced and the tissues extract\n",

Skin abscesses may be very offensive, especially if\ncaused by anaerobic organisms or Pseudomonas spp. Urinary incontinence is\nassociated with the characteristic smell of stale urine, which is often more\noffensive if the patient has a urinary tract infection. The smell of bacterial\nvaginosis is usually just described as offensive. Severe bowel obstruction and\nthe rare gastrocolic fistula can cause faecal contamination of the breath when\nthe patient belches.

For example, a patient’s abdomen is best examined\nif he or she lies flat with one pillow placed so that the abdominal muscles are\nrelaxed. This is discussed in detail in subsequent chapters.\nWithin each of the examining systems, four elements comprise the main\nparts of the physical examination: looking—inspection; feeling—palpation;\ntapping—percussion; and listening—auscultation. For many systems a fifth\nelement, assessment of function, is added. Measuring is also relevant in\nsome systems. Each of these will be discussed in detail in the following\nchapters.\nEvidence-based clinical examination\n \nHistory taking and physical examination are latecomers to evidence-based\nmedicine. There are big efforts in all areas of medicine to base practice on\nevidence of benefit.\nBy their nature, physical signs tend to be subjective and one examiner\nwill not always agree with another. For example, the loudness of a murmur\nor the presence or absence of fingernail changes may be controversial. There\nare often different accepted methods of assessing the presence or absence of\na sign, and experienced clinicians will often disagree about whether, for\nexample, the apex beat is in the normal position or not. Even apparently\nobjective measurements such as the blood pressure can vary depending on\nwhether Korotkov sound IV or V (page 55) is used, and from minute to\nminute for the same patient. Some physical signs are present only\nintermittently; the pericardial rub may disappear before students can be found\nin the games room to come and listen to it.\nA way of looking at the usefulness of a sign or a test is to measure or\nestimate its specificity and sensitivity.\n",

A sign or test that is present or ‘positive’ in a person who does\nnot have the condition is called a false positive. The absence of a sign, or a\nnegative test, in a patient who has the condition is called a false negative.\nAnother way of looking at this is the positive or negative predictive value of a\ntest—that is, the probability that a positive result means the condition is\npresent or that a negative result means it is absent.\nThe likelihood that a test or sign result will be a true positive or negative\ndepends on the pre-test probability of the presence of the condition. For\nexample, if splinter haemorrhages (page 50) are found in the nails of a well\nmanual labourer they are likely to represent a false positive sign of infective\nendocarditis. This sign is not very sensitive or specific and in this case the\npre-test probability of the condition is low. If splinters are found in a sick\npatient with known valvular heart disease and a new murmur, the sign is\nlikely to be a true positive in this patient with a high pre-test probability of\nendocarditis. This pre-test probability analysis of the false and true positive\nrate is based on Bayes’ theorem.\nA useful way to look at sensitivity and specificity is the likelihood ratio\n(LR). A positive LR,\nindicates that the presence of a sign is likely to occur that much more often in\nan individual with the disease than in one without it. The higher the positive\nLR, the more useful is a positive sign. A negative likelihood ratio increases\nthe likelihood that the disease is absent if the sign is not present.\n",

      "text": "Remember that if the LR is greater than 1 there is an increased probability of\ndisease; if the LR is less than 1 there is a decreased probability of disease.\nFor example, the presence of a third heart sound in a patient who might\nhave heart failure (e.g. breathlessness on exertion) has a positive likelihood\nratio of 3.8 and a negative LR around 1. This means that a third heart sound\nis specific for heart failure (increases likelihood of the condition nearly four\ntimes) but not sensitive (the absence of a third heart sound does not reduce\nthe likelihood).\nAll these figures are calculated on a population suspected of disease; it\nwould be quite incorrect to apply them to an asymptomatic group of people.\nFagan’s nomogram (Figure 3.3) can be used to apply LRs to clinical\nproblems if the pre-test probability of the condition is known or can be\nestimated. Remember, positive LRs of 2, 5 and 10 increase the probability of\ndisease by 15%, 30% and 45%, respectively. Similarly, negative LRs of 0.5,\n0.2 and 0.1 decrease the probability of disease by 15%, 30% and 45%\nrespectively.\nWhen the pre-test probability is very low, even a high positive LR does\nnot make the disease very likely. A line is drawn from the pre-test probability\nnumber through the known LR and ends up on the post-test probability\nnumber. For example, if the pre-test probability of the condition is low, say\n10 (10%) and a sign is present which has an LR of 2, the post-test probability\nof the condition being present is only about 20%. We have included the LRs\nin tables of Good signs guides in most chapters of this book.\nInter-observer agreement (reliability) and the κ-statistic\n \nThe LR of a sign assumes that the sign is present but there is considerable\nvariability in the agreement between observers about the presence of many\nsigns. There are a number of reasons for this low reliability (Table 3.10).\nTABLE 3.10 Important reasons for inter-observer disagreement\n \n \n \n \n \n \n1 The sign comes and goes; e.g. basal crackles in heart failure, a\nfourth heart sound\n2 Some of the observers’ technique may be imperfect; e.g. not\nki\nth\nti\nt t\nh b f\nd l i\nth\nf l\n",

This allows\nimproved overall blood oxygenation. Patients with severe orthopnoea spend\nthe night sitting up in a chair or propped up on numerous pillows in bed. The\nabsence of orthopnoea suggests that left ventricular failure is unlikely to be\nthe cause of a patient’s dyspnoea (negative likelihood ratio [LR] = 0.046).\nTABLE 4.5 Causes of orthopnoea\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCardiac failure\nUncommon causes\nMassive ascites\nPregnancy\nBilateral diaphragmatic paralysis\nLarge pleural effusion\nSevere pneumonia\n \nParoxysmalbnocturnal dyspnoea (PND) is severe dyspnoea that wakes\nthe patient from sleep so that he or she is forced to get up gasping for breath.\nThis occurs because of a sudden failure of left ventricular output with an\nacute rise in pulmonary venous and capillary pressures; this leads to\ntransudation of fluid into the interstitial tissues, which increases the work of\nbreathing. The sequence may be precipitated by resorption of peripheral\noedema at night while supine. Acute cardiac dyspnoea may also occur with\nacute pulmonary oedema or a pulmonary embolus.\nCardiac dyspnoea can be difficult to distinguish from that due to lung\ndisease or other causes (page 109)7.

A patient with a history of\nhypertension or a very heavy alcohol intake may have hypertensive heart\ndisease or an alcoholic cardiomyopathy. The presence of orthopnoea or\nparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea is more suggestive of cardiac failure than of\nlung disease.\nDyspnoea is also a common symptom of anxiety. These patients often\ndescribe an inability to take a big enough breath to fill the lungs in a satisfying\nway. Their breathing may be deep and punctuated with sighs.\nAnkle swelling\n \nSome patients present with bilateral ankle swelling due to oedema from\ncardiac failure. Patients with the recent onset of oedema and who take a\nserious interest in their weight may have noticed a gain in weight of 3 kg or\nmore. Ankle oedema of cardiac origin is usually symmetrical and worst in the\nevenings, with improvement during the night. It may be a symptom of\nbiventricular failure or right ventricular failure secondary to a number of\npossible underlying aetiologies. As failure progresses, oedema ascends to\ninvolve the legs, thighs, genitalia and abdomen. There are usually other\nsymptoms or signs of heart disease.\nIt is important to find out whether the patient is taking a vasodilating\ndrug (e.g. a calcium channel blocker), which can cause peripheral oedema.\nThere are other (more) common causes of ankle oedema than heart failure\nthat also need to be considered (page 71).

Cardiac\narrhythmias are usually instantaneous in onset and offset, whereas the onset\nand offset of sinus tachycardia is more gradual. A completely irregular\nrhythm is suggestive of atrial fibrillation, particularly if it is rapid.\nIt may be helpful to ask the patient to tap the rate and rhythm of the\npalpitations with his or her finger. Associated features including pain,\ndyspnoea or faintness must be inquired about. The awareness of rapid\npalpitations followed by syncope suggests ventricular tachycardia. These\npatients usually have a past history of significant heart disease. Any rapid\nrhythm may precipitate angina in a patient with ischaemic heart disease.\n",

How old were they?\n7. Have you had kidney problems?\n \nPrevious ischaemic heart disease is the most important risk factor for\nfurther ischaemia. The patient may know of previous infarcts or have had a\ndiagnosis of angina in the past.\nHypercholesterolaemia is the next most important risk factor for\nischaemic heart disease. Many patients now know their serum cholesterol\nlevels because widespread testing has become fashionable. The total serum\ncholesterol is a useful screening test, and levels above 5.2 mmol/L are\nconsidered undesirable. Cholesterol measurements (unlike triglyceride\nmeasurements) are accurate even when a patient has not been fasting.\nPatients with established coronary artery disease benefit from lowering of\ntotal cholesterol to below 4 mmol/L. An elevated total cholesterol level is\neven more significant if the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level is low (less\nthan 1.0 mmol/L). Significant elevation of the triglyceride level is a coronary\nrisk factor in its own right and also adds further to the risk if the total\ncholesterol is high. If a patient already has coronary disease, hyperlipidaemia\nis even more important. Control of risk factors for these patients is called\n‘secondary prevention’. Patients who have multiple risk factors for ischaemic\nheart disease (e.g. diabetes and hypertension) should have their cholesterol\ncontrolled aggressively. If the patient’s cholesterol is known to be high, it is\nworth obtaining a dietary history. This can be very trying. It is important to\nremember that not only foods containing cholesterol but those containing\nsaturated fats contribute to the serum cholesterol level. High alcohol\nconsumption and obesity are associated with hypertriglyceridaemia.\nSmoking is probably the next most important risk factor for\ncardiovascular disease and peripheral vascular disease. Some patients\ndescribe themselves as non-smokers even though they stopped smoking only\na few hours before. The number of years the patient has smoked and the\nnumber of cigarettes smoked per day are both very important (and are\nrecorded as packet-years, page 6). The significance of a history of smoking\n",

      "text": "for a patient who has not smoked for many years is controversial. The risk of\nsymptomatic ischaemic heart disease falls gradually over the years after\nsmoking has been stopped. After about 2 years the risk of myocardial\ninfarction falls to the same level as for those who have never smoked. After\n10 years the risk of developing angina falls close to that of non-smokers.\nHypertension is another important risk factor for coronary artery\ndisease. Find out when hypertension was first diagnosed and what treatment,\nif any, has been instituted. The treatment of hypertension probably does\nreduce the risk of ischaemic heart disease, and certainly reduces the risk of\nhypertensive heart disease, cardiac failure and cerebrovascular disease.\nTreatment of hypertension has also been shown to reverse left ventricular\nhypertrophy.\nA family history of coronary artery disease increases a patient’s risk,\nparticularly if it has been present in first-degree relatives (parents or siblings)\nand if it has affected these people below the age of 60. Not all heart disease,\nhowever, is ischaemic; a patient whose relatives suffered from rheumatic\nheart disease is at no greater risk of ischaemic heart disease than anybody\nelse.\nA history of diabetes mellitus increases the risk of ischaemic heart\ndisease very substantially. A diabetic without a history of ischaemic heart\ndisease has the same risk of myocardial infarction as a non-diabetic who has\nhad an infarct. It is important to find out how long a patient has been diabetic\nand whether insulin treatment has been required. Good control of the blood\nsugar level of diabetics reduces this risk. An attempt should therefore be\nmade to find out how well a patient’s diabetes has been controlled.\nChronic kidney disease is associated with a very high risk of vascular\ndisease. This is possibly related to high calcium-times-phosphate product and\nmay be reduced by dietary intervention, ‘phosphate binders’, efficient\ndialysis, in renal transplant. Ischaemic heart disease is the most common\ncause of death in renal failure patients on dialysis.\nThe presence of multiple risk factors makes control of each one more\nimportant. Aggressive control of risk factors is often indicated in these\npatients.\nIt is interesting to note that in the diagnosis of angina the patient’s\ndescription of typical symptoms is more discriminating than is the presence of\nrisk factors which only marginally increase the likelihood that chest pain is\nischaemic. Previous ischaemic heart disease is an exception. Certainly a\npatient who has had angina before and says he or she has it again, is usually\nright.\nTeeth\n",

It is very useful at this stage\nto find out how a diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease was made and in\nparticular what investigations were undertaken. The patient may well\nremember exercise testing or a coronary angiogram, and some patients can\neven remember how many coronary arteries were narrowed, how many\ncoronary bypasses were performed (having more than three grafts often leads\nto a certain amount of boasting).

One current theory is that platelet-derived growth\nfactor (PDGF), released from megakaryocyte and platelet emboli in the nail\nbeds, causes fibrovascular proliferation. Megakaryocytes and clumps of\nplatelets do not normally reach the arterial circulation. Their large size (up to\n50 μm) prevents their passing through the pulmonary capillaries when they\nare released from the bone marrow. In conditions where platelets may clump\nin the arterial circulation (infected cardiac valve) or bypass the pulmonary\ncapillaries (right to left shunt associated with congenital heart disease), they\ncan reach the systemic circulation and become trapped in the terminal\ncapillaries of the fingers and toes.

In\nbeats where diastole is too short for adequate filling of the heart, too small a volume of blood is ejected during\nsystole for a pulse to be appreciated at the wrist.\nRhythm\n \nThe rhythm of the pulse can be regular or irregular. An irregular rhythm can\nbe completely irregular with no pattern (irregularly irregular or chaotic\nrhythm); this is usually due to atrial fibrillation (Table 4.10). In atrial\nfibrillation coordinated atrial contraction is lost, and chaotic electrical activity\noccurs with bombardment of the atrioventricular (AV) node with impulses at\na rate of over 600 per minute. Only a variable proportion of these is\nconducted to the ventricles because (fortunately) the AV node is unable to\nconduct at such high rates. In this way, the ventricles are protected from very\nrapid rates, but beat irregularly, usually at rates between 150 and 180 per\nminute (unless the patient is being treated with drugs to slow the heart rate).\nThe pulse also varies in amplitude from beat to beat in atrial fibrillation\nbecause of differing diastolic filling times. This type of pulse can occasionally\nbe simulated by frequent irregularly occurring supraventricular or ventricular\nectopic beats.\nPatients with atrial fibrillation or frequent ectopic beats may have a\ndetectable pulse deficit. This means the heart rate when counted by listening\nto the heart with the stethoscope is higher than that obtained when the radial\npulse is counted at the wrist. In these patients the heart sounds will be audible\nwith every systole, but some early contractions preceded by short diastolic\nfilling periods will not produce enough cardiac output for a pulse to be\npalpable at the wrist.\nAn irregular rhythm can also be regularly irregular.

Usually, indirect measurements of the\nsystolic and diastolic pressures are obtained with a sphygmomanometer\n(Greek sphygmos ‘pulsing’, manos ‘thin’).13 The systolic blood pressure is\nthe peak pressure that occurs in the artery following ventricular systole, and\nthe diastolic blood pressure is the level to which the arterial blood pressure\nfalls during ventricular diastole. Normal blood pressure is defined as a systolic\nreading of less than 140 mmHg and a diastolic reading of less than 90\nmmHg. In some circumstances, lower pressures may be considered normal\n(e.g. in pregnancy) or desirable (e.g. for diabetics).\nMeasuring the blood pressure with the sphygmomanometer\n \nThe usual blood pressure cuff width is 12.5 cm. This is suitable for a normal-\nsized adult forearm. However, in obese patients with large arms (up to 30%\nof the adult population) the normal-sized cuff will overestimate the blood\npressure and therefore a large cuff must be used. A range of smaller sizes are\navailable for children. Use of a cuff that is too large results in only a small\nunderestimate of blood pressure.\nThe cuff is wrapped around the upper arm with the bladder centred\nover the brachial artery (Figure 4.16). This is found in the antecubital fossa,\none-third of the way over from the medial epicondyle. For an approximate\nestimation of the systolic blood pressure, the cuff is fully inflated and then\ndeflated slowly (3–4 mmHg per second) until the radial pulse returns. Then,\nfor a more accurate estimation of the blood pressure, this manoeuvre is\nrepeated with the diaphragm of the stethoscope placed over the brachial\nartery, slipped underneath the distal end of the cuff’s bladder.\n",

If the arm\nis too high, e.g. at the level of the supraclavicular notch, the blood pressure\nreading will be about 5 mmHg lower; and if the arm is too low the reading\nwill be higher than is accurate.\nFive different sounds will be heard as the cuff is slowly released (Figure\n4.17). These are called the Korotkoffo sounds. The pressure at which a\nsound is first heard over the artery is the systolic blood pressure (Korotkoff\nI). As deflation of the cuff continues, the sound increases in intensity (KII),\nthen decreases (KIII), becomes muffled (KIV) and then disappears (KV).\nDifferent observers have used KIV and KV to indicate the level of the\ndiastolic pressure. KV is probably the best measure. However, this provides a\nslight underestimate of the arterial diastolic blood pressure.

This can lead to an underestimate of the systolic blood\npressure if the cuff is not pumped up high enough.\nThe systolic blood pressure may normally vary between the arms by up\nto 10 mmHg; in the legs the blood pressure is normally up to 20 mmHg\nhigher than in the arms, unless the patient has coarctation of the aorta.\nMeasurement of the blood pressure in the legs is more difficult than in the\narms. It requires a large cuff that is placed over the mid-thigh. The patient\nlies prone and the stethoscope is placed in the popliteal fossa, behind the\nknee.\nDuring inspiration, the systolic and diastolic blood pressures normally\ndecrease (because intrathoracic pressure becomes more negative, blood pools\nin the pulmonary vessels, so left-heart filling is reduced). When this normal\nreduction in blood pressure with inspiration is exaggerated, it is termed\npulsus paradoxus. Kussmaul meant by this that there was a fall in blood\npressure and a paradoxical rise in pulse rate. A fall in arterial pulse pressure\non inspiration of more than 10 mmHg is abnormal and may occur with\nconstrictive pericarditis, pericardial effusion, or severe asthma. To detect\nthis: lower the cuff pressure slowly until KI sounds are heard intermittently\n(expiration) and then until KI is audible with every beat. The difference\nbetween the two readings represents the level of the pulsus paradoxus.\nVariations in blood pressure\n \nWhen blood pressure is measured with an intra-arterial catheter it becomes\nclear that blood pressure varies from minute to minute in normal people.\nShort-term changes of 4 mmHg in the systolic and 3 mmHg in the diastolic\nreadings are common. Hour-to-hour and day-to-day variations are even\ngreater. The standard deviation between visits is up to 12 mmHg for systolic\npressure and 8 mmHg for diastolic. This means that when there is concern\nabout an abnormal reading, repeat measurements are necessary.\nWhen the heart is very irregular (most often because of atrial\nfibrillation), the cuff should be deflated slowly, and the point at which most\nof the cardiac contractions are audible (KI) taken as the systolic pressure and\nthe point at which most have disappeared (KV) taken as diastole.\nHigh blood pressure\n \n13\n",

The patient\nmust be lying down at 45 degrees to the horizontal with his or her head on\npillows and in good lighting conditions. This is a difficult examination and\nthere is considerable inter- (and intra-)observer variation in the findings.\nWhen the patient is lying at 45 degrees, the sternal angle is also roughly\nin line with the base of the neck (Figure 4.5c). This provides a convenient\nzero point from which to measure the vertical height of the column of blood\nin the jugular vein. The jugular venous pulsation (movement) can be\ndistinguished from the arterial pulse because: (i) it is visible but not palpable\nand has a more prominent inward movement than the artery; (ii) it has a\ncomplex wave form, usually seen to flicker twice with each cardiac cycle (if\nthe patient is in sinus rhythm); (iii) it moves on respiration—normally the\nJVP decreases on inspiration; and (iv) it is at first obliterated and then filled\nfrom above when light pressure is applied at the base of the neck.\nThe JVP must be assessed for height and character. When the JVP is\nmore than 3 cm above the zero point, the right-heart filling pressure is raised\n(a normal reading is less than 8 cm of water: 5 cm + 3 cm). This is a sign of\nright ventricular failure, volume overload or of some types of pericardial\ndisease.\nThe assessment of the character of JVP is difficult even for experienced\nclinicians. There are two positive waves in the normal JVP. r The first is\ncalled the a wave and coincides with right atrial systole.s It is due to atrial\ncontraction. The a wave also coincides with the first heart sound and\nprecedes the carotid pulsation. The second impulse is called the v wave and is\ndue to atrial filling, in the period when the tricuspid valve remains closed\nduring ventricular systole. Between the a and v waves there is a trough\ncaused by atrial relaxation. This is called the x descent. It is interrupted by\nthe c point, which is due to transmitted carotid pulsation and coincides with\ntricuspid valve closure; it is not usually visible. Following the v wave, the\ntricuspid valve opens and rapid ventricular filling occurs; this results in the y\ndescent (Figure 4.22).\n",

The JVP normally\nrises transiently following this manoeuvre.u If there is right ventricular failure\nor left atrial pressures are elevated (left ventricular failure), it may remain\nelevated (>4cm) for the duration of the compression—a positive\nhepatojugular reflux. The sudden fall in the JVP (>4 cm) as the pressure is\nreleased may be easier to see than the initial rise. It is not necessary to\ncompress the liver and so the older name, hepatojugular reflux, is not so\nappropriate. It is important that the patient be relaxed, breathe through the\nmouth and not perform a Valsalva manoeuvre. The examiner should press\nfirmly with the palm over the middle of the abdomen. It is not necessary to\napply pressure for more than 10 seconds.\nCannon a waves occur when the right atrium contracts against the\nclosed tricuspid valve.

In this operation a stenosed\nmitral valve is opened through an incision made in the left atrial appendage;\ncardiopulmonary bypass is not required. Coronary artery bypass grafting and\neven valve surgery are now sometimes performed using small lateral ‘port’\nincisions for video-assisted instruments.\nSkeletal abnormalities such as pectus excavatum (funnel chest, page\n121) or kyphoscoliosis (Greek kyphos ‘hunchbacked’, skolios ‘curved’), a\ncurvature of the vertebral column (page 121), may be present. Skeletal\nabnormalities such as these, which may be part of Marfan’s syndrome, can\ncause distortion of the position of the heart and great vessels in the chest and\nthus alter the position of the apex beat. Severe deformity can interfere with\npulmonary function and cause pulmonary hypertension (page 81).\nAnother surgical ‘abnormality’ that must not be missed, if only to avoid\nembarrassment, is a pacemaker or cardioverter-defibrillator box. These are\nusually under the right or left pectoral muscle just below the clavicle, are\nusually easily palpable and obviously metallic. The pacemaker leads may be\npalpable under the skin, leading from the top of the box. The box is normally\nmobile under the skin. Fixation of the skin to the box or stretching of the skin\nover the box may be an indication for repositioning. Erosion of the box\nthrough the skin is a serious complication because of the inevitable infection\nthat will occur around this foreign body. Rarely, a loose lead connection will\nlead to twitching of the muscles of the chest wall around the box. Penetration\nof the right ventricular lead into or through the right ventricular wall may lead\nto disconcerting paced diaphragmatic contractions (hiccups) at whatever rate\nthe pacemaker is set. Defibrillator boxes are larger than pacemakers. They\nare currently about 10 × 5 cm and a little less than 1 cm thick.\nLook for the apex beat. Its normal position is in the fifth left intercostal\nspace, 1 cm medial to the midclavicular line (Figure 4.23). It is due primarily\nto recoil of the heart as blood is expelled in systole. There may be other\nvisible pulsations—for example, over the pulmonary artery in cases of severe\npulmonary hypertension.\n",

The normal apex beat gently lifts the palpating fingers.\nThere are a number of types of abnormal apex beats. The pressure loaded\n(heaving, hyperdynamic or systolic overloaded) apex beat is a forceful and\nsustained impulse. This occurs with aortic stenosis or hypertension. The\nvolume loaded (thrusting) apex beat is a displaced, diffuse, non-sustained\nimpulse. This occurs most commonly in advanced mitral regurgitation or\ndilated cardiomyopathy. The dyskinetic apex beat is an uncoordinated\nimpulse felt over a larger area than normal in the praecordium and is usually\ndue to left ventricular dysfunction (e.g. in anterior myocardial infarction).\nThe double impulse apex beat, where two distinct impulses are felt with each\nsystole, is characteristic of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (page 91). The\ntapping apex beat will be felt when the first heart sound is actually palpable\n(heart sounds are not palpable in health) and indicates mitral or very rarely\ntricuspid stenosis. The character, but not the position, of the apex beat may\nbe more easily assessed when the patient lies on the left side.\nIn many patients the apex beat may not be palpable.

The apex beat will be palpable to the right of the sternum in many\ncases of dextrocardia.\nOther praecordial impulses may be palpable in patients with heart\ndisease. A parasternal impulse may be felt when the heel of the hand is\nrested just to the left of the sternum with the fingers lifted slightly off the\nchest (Figure 4.25).

Auscultation of the\nnormal heart reveals two sounds called, not surprisingly, the first and second\nheart sounds. The explanation for the origin of these noises changes from\nyear to year; the sounds are probably related to vibrations caused by the\nclosing of the heart valves in combination with rapid changes in blood flow\nand tensing within cardiac structures that occur as the valves close.\nThe first heart sound (S1) has two components: mitral and tricuspid\nvalve closure. Mitral closure occurs slightly before tricuspid, but usually only\none sound is audible. The first heart sound indicates the beginning of\nventricular systole.\nThe second heart sound (S2), which is softer, shorter and at a slightly\nhigher pitch than the first and marks the end of systole, is made up of sounds\narising from aortic and pulmonary valve closures. In normal cases, although\nleft and right ventricular systole end at the same time, the lower pressure in\nthe pulmonary circulation compared with the aorta means that flow continues\ninto the pulmonary artery after the end of right ventricular systole. As a\nresult, closure of the pulmonary valve occurs later than that of the aortic\nvalve. These components are usually (in 70% of normal adults) sufficiently\nseparated in time so that splitting of the second heart sound is audible.\nBecause the pulmonary component of the second heart sound (P2) may not\nbe audible throughout the praecordium, splitting of the second heart sound\nmay best be appreciated in the pulmonary area and along the left sternal\nedge. Pulmonary valve closure is further delayed (by 20 or 30 milliseconds)\nwith inspiration because of increased venous return to the right ventricle;\nthus, splitting of the second heart sound is wider on inspiration. The second\nheart sound marks the beginning of diastole, which is usually longer than\nsystole.\nIt can be difficult to decide which heart sound is which. Palpation of the\ncarotid pulse will indicate the timing of systole and enable the heart sounds to\nbe more easily distinguished. It is obviously crucial to define systole and\ndiastole during auscultation so that cardiac murmurs and abnormal sounds\ncan be placed in the correct part of the cardiac cycle. Students are often\nasked to time a cardiac murmur; this is not a request to measure its length,\nbut rather to say in which part of the cardiac cycle it occurs. Even the experts\ncan mistake a murmur if they do not time it. It is important, during\nauscultation, to concentrate separately on the components of the cardiac\ncycle. The clinician should attempt to identify each and listen for\nabnormalities. There can be more than 12 components to identify in patients\n",

Therefore, pulmonary ejection sounds occur closer to\nthe first heart sound than do aortic ejection sounds.

This occurs in mitral stenosis because the narrowed valve\norifice limits ventricular filling so that there is no diminution in flow towards\nthe end of diastole. The normal mitral valve cusps drift back towards the\nclosed position at the end of diastole as ventricular filling slows down. Other\ncauses of a loud S1 are related to reduced diastolic filling time (e.g.\ntachycardia or any cause of a short atrioventricular conduction time).\nSoft first heart sounds can be due to a prolonged diastolic filling time (as\nwith first-degree heart block) or a delayed onset of left ventricular systole (as\nwith left bundle branch block), or to failure of the leaflets to coapt normally\n(as in mitral regurgitation).\nThe second heart sound (S2) will have a loud aortic component (A2)\nin patients with systemic hypertension. This results in forceful aortic valve\nclosure secondary to high aortic pressures. Congenital aortic stenosis is\nanother cause, because the valve is mobile but narrowed, and closes\nsuddenly at the end of systole. The pulmonary component of the second\nheart sound (P2) is traditionally said to be loud in pulmonary hypertension,\nwhere the valve closure is forceful because of the high pulmonary pressure.\nIn fact, a palpable P2 correlates better with raised pulmonary pressures than\na loud P2.21\nA soft A2 will be found when the aortic valve is calcified and leaflet\nmovement is reduced, and in aortic regurgitation when the leaflets cannot\ncoapt.\nSplitting\n \nSplitting of the heart sound is usually most obvious during auscultation in the\npulmonary area.

This is\ncaused by an atrial septal defect where equalisation of volume loads between\nthe two atria occurs through the defect. This results in the atria acting as a\ncommon chamber.\nIn the case of reversed splitting, P2 occurs first and splitting occurs in\nexpiration. This can be due to delayed left ventricular depolarisation (left\nbundle branch block), delayed left ventricular emptying (severe aortic\nstenosis, coarctation of the aorta) or increased left ventricular volume load\n(large patent ductus arteriosus). However, in the last-mentioned, the loud\nmachinery murmur means that the second heart sound is usually not heard.\nExtra heart sounds\n \nThe third heart sound (S3) is a low-pitched (20–70 Hz) mid-diastolic sound\nthat is best appreciated by listening for a triple rhythm.22 Its low pitch makes\nit more easily heard with the bell of the stethoscope. It has been likened\n(rather accurately) to the galloping of a horse and is often called a gallop\nrhythm. Its cadence is similar to that of the word ‘Kentucky’. It is more\nlikely to be appreciated if the clinician listens not to the individual heart\nsounds but to the rhythm of the heart. It is probably caused by tautening of\nthe mitral or tricuspid papillary muscles at the end of rapid diastolic filling,\nwhen blood flow temporarily stops. A physiological left ventricular S3\nsometimes occurs in children and young people and is due to very rapid\ndiastolic filling. A pathological S3 is due to reduced ventricular compliance,\nso that a filling sound is produced even when diastolic filling is not especially\nrapid. It is strongly associated with increased atrial pressure.\nA left ventricular S3 is louder at the apex than at the left sternal edge,\nand is louder on expiration. It can be associated with an increased cardiac\noutput, as occurs in pregnancy and thyrotoxicosis.

Its low pitch means that unlike a split first heart sound it\ndisappears if the bell of the stethoscope is pressed firmly onto the chest.\nA left ventricular S4 occurs whenever left ventricular compliance is\nreduced due to aortic stenosis, acute mitral regurgitation, systemic\nhypertension, ischaemic heart disease or advanced age.

      "text": "The pansystolic murmur extends throughout systole, beginning with the\nfirst heart sound, then going right up to the second heart sound. Its loudness\nand pitch vary during systole. Pansystolic murmurs occur when a ventricle\nleaks to a lower pressure chamber or vessel. As there is a pressure difference\nfrom the moment the ventricle begins to contract (S1), blood flow and the\nmurmur both begin at the first heart sound and continue until the pressures\nequalise (S2). Causes of pansystolic murmurs include mitral regurgitation,x\ntricuspid regurgitation and ventricular septal defect.\nWith an ejection (mid)systolic murmur, the murmur does not begin\nright at the first heart sound; its intensity is greatest in midsystole or later, and\nwanes again late in systole. This is described as a crescendo-decrescendo\nmurmur. These murmurs are usually caused by turbulent flow through the\naortic or pulmonary valve orifices or by greatly increased flow through a\nnormal-sized orifice or outflow tract.\nWith a late systolic murmur it is possible to distinguish an appreciable\ngap between the first heart sound and the murmur, which then continues\nright up to the second heart sound. This is typical of mitral valve prolapse or\npapillary muscle dysfunction where mitral regurgitation begins in midsystole.\nDiastolic murmurs occur during ventricular diastole. They are more\ndifficult for students to hear than systolic murmurs and are usually softer. A\nloud murmur is unlikely to be diastolic.\nThe early diastolic murmur begins immediately with the second heart\nsound and has a decrescendo quality (it is loudest at the beginning and\nextends for a variable distance into diastole). These early diastolic murmurs\nare typically high pitched and are due to regurgitation through leaking aortic\nor pulmonary valves. The murmur is loudest at the beginning because this is\nwhen aortic and pulmonary artery pressures are highest.\nMid-diastolic murmurs begin later in diastole and may be short or\nextend right up to the first heart sound. They have a much lower-pitched\nquality than early diastolic murmurs. They are due to impaired flow during\nventricular filling and can be caused by mitral stenosis and tricuspid stenosis,\nwhere the valve is narrowed, or rarely by an atrial myxoma, where the\ntumour mass obstructs the valve orifice. In severe aortic regurgitation, the\nregurgitant jet from the aortic valve may cause the anterior leaflet of the\nmitral valve to shudder, producing a diastolic murmur. Occasionally, normal\nmitral or tricuspid valves can produce flow murmurs, which are short and\nmid-diastolic, and occur when there is torrential flow across the valve.\nCauses include a high cardiac output or intracardiac shunting (atrial or\nventricular septal defects).\nPresystolic murmurs may be heard when atrial systole increases blood\nflow across the valve just before the first heart sound. They are extensions of\nthe mid-diastolic murmurs of mitral stenosis and tricuspid stenosis, and\nusually do not occur when atrial systole is lost in atrial fibrillation.\n",

      "text": "y\ny\nAs the name implies, continuous murmurs extend throughout systole\nand diastole. They are produced when a communication exists between two\nparts of the circulation with a permanent pressure gradient so that blood flow\noccurs continuously. They can usually be distinguished from combined\nsystolic and diastolic murmurs (due, for example, to aortic stenosis and aortic\nregurgitation), but this may sometimes be difficult. The causes are presented\nin Table 4.15.\nA pericardial friction rub is a superficial scratching sound; there may\nbe up to three distinct components occurring at any time during the cardiac\ncycle. They are not confined to systole or diastole. A rub is caused by\nmovement of inflamed pericardial surfaces; it is a result of pericarditis. The\nsound can vary with respiration and posture; it is often louder when the\npatient is sitting up and breathing out. It tends to come and go, and is often\nabsent by the time students can be found to come and listen for it. It has\nbeen likened to the crunching sound made when walking on snow.\nA mediastinal crunch (Hamman’s signy) is a crunching sound heard in\ntime with the heartbeat but with systolic and diastolic components. It is\ncaused by the presence of air in the mediastinum, and once heard it is not\nforgotten. It is very often present after cardiac surgery and may occur\nassociated with a pneumothorax or after aspiration of a pericardial effusion.\nArea of greatest intensity\n \nAlthough the place on the praecordium where a murmur is heard most easily\nis a guide to its origin, this is not a particularly reliable physical sign. For\nexample, mitral regurgitation murmurs (GOOD SIGNS GUIDE 4.1) are\nusually loudest at the apex, over the mitral area, and tend to radiate towards\nthe axillae, but they may be heard widely over the praecordium and even\nright up into the aortic area or over the back.

For example, in the severest forms of valve\nstenosis, murmurs may be soft. However, murmurs are usually graded\naccording to loudness. Cardiologists most often use a classification with six\ngrades (Levine’s grading system):27\nGrade 1/6: very soft and not heard at first (often audible only to\nconsultants and to those students who have been told the murmur is present)\nGrade 2/6: soft, but can be detected almost immediately by an experienced\nauscultator\nGrade 3/6: moderate; there is no thrill\nGrade 4/6: loud; thrill just palpable\nGrade 5/6: very loud; thrill easily palpable\nGrade 6/6: very, very loud; can be heard even without placing the\nstethoscope right on the chest.\nThis grading is useful, particularly because a change in the intensity of a\nmurmur may be of great significance—for example, after a myocardial\ninfarction.\nIt requires practice to appreciate the pitch of the murmur, but this may\nbe of use in identifying its type. In general, low-pitched murmurs indicate\nturbulent flow under low pressure, as in mitral stenosis, and high-pitched\nmurmurs indicate a high velocity of flow, as in mitral regurgitation.\nDynamic manoeuvres (GOOD SIGNS GUIDE 4.2)\n \nAll patients with a newly diagnosed murmur should undergo dynamic\nmanoeuvre testing (Table 4.16).28\nRespiration.

In phase 1 (beginning the\nmanoeuvre), a rise in intrathoracic pressure and a transient increase in left\nventricular output and blood pressure occurs. In phase 2 (the straining\nphase), systemic venous return falls, filling of the right and then the left side\nof the heart is reduced, and stroke volume and blood pressure fall while the\nheart rate increases. As stroke volume and arterial blood pressure fall, most\ncardiac murmurs become softer; however, because the left ventricular\nvolume is reduced, the systolic murmur of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\nbecomes louder and the systolic click and murmur of mitral valve prolapse\nbegins earlier. In phase 3 (the release of the manoeuvre), first right-sided and\nthen left-sided cardiac murmurs become louder briefly before returning to\nnormal. Blood pressure falls further because of pooling of blood in the\npulmonary veins. In phase 4, the blood pressure overshoots as a result of\nincreased sympathetic activity as a response to the previous hypotension.\nChanges in heart rate are opposite to the blood pressure changes.\nThe blood pressure responses can be measured by inflating a cuff to 15\nmmHg over the systolic pressure before the manoeuvre. Korotkoff sounds\nwill then appear in phases 1 and 4 in a normal patient. Absence of the phase\n4 overshoot is a sign of cardiac failure. The left ventricle is unable to increase\ncardiac output despite increased sympathetic activity.\nStanding to squatting. When the patient squats rapidly from the standing\nposition, venous return and systemic arterial resistance increase\nsimultaneously, causing a rise in stroke volume and arterial pressure. This\nmakes most murmurs louder. However, left ventricular size is increased,\nwhich reduces the obstruction to outflow and therefore reduces the intensity\nof the systolic murmur of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, while the\nmidsystolic click and murmur of mitral valve prolapse are delayed.\nSquatting to standing. When the patient stands up quickly after squatting,\nthe opposite changes in the loudness of these murmurs occurs.\nIsometric exercise. Sustained hand grip or repeated sit-ups for 20 for 30\nseconds increases systemic arterial resistance, blood pressure and heart size.\nThe systolic murmur of aortic stenosis may become softer because of a\nreduction in the pressure difference across the valve but often remains\nunchanged.

These sounds are\nlow-pitched and may be more easily heard with the bell of the stethoscope.\nCarotid artery bruits are most easily heard over the anterior part of the\nsternomastoid muscle above the medial end of the clavicle. Ask the patient to\nstop breathing for a brief period to remove the competing noise of breath\nsounds. It may be prudent to ask the patient not to speak. The amplified\nvoice is often painfully loud when heard through the stethoscope.\nA systolic bruit may be a conducted sound from the heart. The murmur\nof aortic stenosis is always audible in the neck and a soft carotid bruit is\nsometimes audible in patients with severe mitral regurgitation or pulmonary\nstenosis. A bruit due to carotid stenosis will not be audible over the base of\nthe heart. Move the stethoscope from point to point onto the chest wall; if\nthe bruit disappears, it is likely the sound arises from the carotid. It is not\npossible to exclude a carotid bruit in a patient with a murmur of aortic\nstenosis that radiates to the neck. Carotid artery stenosis is an important\ncause of a carotid bruit. More severe stenosis is associated with a noise that\nis longer and of increased pitch. Total obstruction of the vessel leads to\ndisappearance of the bruit. It is not possible to make a diagnosis of significant\n(>60% obstruction) carotid stenosis clinically. The bottom line is that a\ncarotid bruit poorly predicts significant carotid stenosis or stroke\nrisk.Thyrotoxicosis can result in a systolic bruit (page 303) due to the\nincreased vascularity of the gland.\nA continuous noise is sometimes audible at the base of the neck. This is\nusually a venous hum, a result of audible venous flow. It disappears if light\npressure is applied to the neck just above the stethoscope.

Deep venous thrombosis is usually caused by prolonged\nimmobilisation, cardiac failure (stasis) or trauma (vessel wall damage), but\nmay also result from occult neoplasm, disseminated intravascular coagulation,\nthe contraceptive pill, pregnancy and a number of inherited defects of\ncoagulation (the thrombophilias: e.g. Factor V Leiden, anti-thrombin III\ndeficiency).\nVaricose veins\n \nIf a patient complains of ‘varicose veins’, ask him or her to stand with the\nlegs fully exposed.36Inspect the front of the whole leg for tortuous, dilated\nbranches of the long saphenous vein (below the femoral vein in the groin to\nthe medial side of the lower leg). Then inspect the back of the calf for\nvaricosities of the short saphenous vein (from the popliteal fossa to the back\nof the calf and lateral malleolus). Look to see if the leg is inflamed, swollen\nor pigmented (subcutaneous haemosiderin deposition secondary to venous\nstasis).\nPalpate the veins. Hard leg veins suggest thrombosis, while tenderness\nindicates thrombophlebitis. Perform the cough impulse test. Put the fingers\nover the long saphenous vein opening in the groin, medial to the femoral\nvein. (Don’t forget the anatomy—femoral vein [medial], artery [your\nlandmark], nerve [lateral].) Ask the patient to cough: a fluid thrill is felt if the\nsaphenofemoral valve is incompetent.\nThe following supplementary tests are occasionally helpful (and\nsurgeons like to quiz students on them in examinations).\nTrendelenburg test:ee with the patient lying down, the leg is elevated.\n",

It can cause considerable alarm to both the patient and the\nexamining clinician. These murmurs in asymptomatic people are often the\nresult of normal turbulence within the heart and great vessels. When no\nstructural abnormality of the heart or great vessels is present these are called\ninnocent, functional \nor organic murmurs. They probably arise from\nvibrations within the aortic arch near the origins of the head and neck vessels\nor from the right ventricular outflow tract. They are more common in\nchildren and young adults. They are louder just after exercise and during\nfebrile illnesses (a common time for them to be detected).\nInnocent murmurs are always systolic. (A venous hum, which is not\nreally a murmur, has both systolic and diastolic components.) They are\nusually soft and ejection-systolic in character.

Many other signs have\nbeen described, but they are interesting rather than helpful (Table 4.20;\nGOOD SIGNS GUIDE 4.8).\n• Signs indicating severe chronic aortic regurgitation: collapsing pulse;\nwide pulse pressure (systolic pressure 80 mmHg more than the diastolic);\nlong decrescendo diastolic murmur; left ventricular S3 (third heart sound);\nsoft A2; Austin Flint murmur; signs of left ventricular failure.\n• Causes of aortic regurgitation: disease may affect the valvular area or\naortic root, and may be acute or chronic.\n• Causes of chronic aortic regurgitation: (i) valvular—rheumatic (rarely\nthe only murmur in this case), congenital (e.g. bicuspid valve; ventricular\nseptal defect—an associated prolapse of the aortic cusp is not uncommon),\nseronegative arthropathy, especially ankylosing spondylitis; (ii) aortic root\ndilatation (murmur may be maximal at the right sternal border)—Marfan’s\nsyndrome, aortitis (e.g. seronegative arthropathies, rheumatoid arthritis,\ntertiary syphilis), dissecting aneurysm.\n• Acute aortic regurgitation: presents differently—there is no collapsing\npulse (blood pressure is low) and the diastolic murmur is short.\n• Causes of acute aortic regurgitation: (i) valvular—infective\nendocarditis; (ii) aortic root—Marfan’s syndrome, dissecting aneurysm of the\naortic root.\nTABLE 4.20 Eponymous signs of aortic regurgitation44\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

A systolic thrill caused by pulmonary valve or right\nventricular outflow obstruction may be present. There is no overall\ncardiomegaly. On auscultation the second heart sound is single and there are\nno signs of pulmonary hypertension; a pulmonary systolic ejection murmur is\npresent.\n‘Grown-up’ congenital heart disease\n \nPatients who have been treated for serious congenital cardiac conditions now\nfrequently survive into adult life. Many of the surgical procedures undertaken\nfor these conditions, especially 20 years ago, were palliative rather than\ncurative. The patients present with specific symptoms and signs.\nTetralogy of Fallot\n \nPatients who have had repair of this condition in infancy may present with\nparticular problems. Repair of the right ventricular outflow obstruction and\nenlargement of the pulmonary valve annulus may leave severe pulmonary\nregurgitation. This may lead eventually to exertional dyspnoea. The surgery\nitself has, until recently, required a right ventriculotomy (cutting into the right\nventricle). This leaves a scar that can be associated with cardiac rhythm\nabnormalities in later life. Patients may present with palpitations or syncope.\n• Signs: may include a median sternotomy scar, a long diastolic murmur of\npulmonary regurgitation, and signs of right ventricular enlargement\n(parasternal impulse) and later of tricuspid regurgitation (big v waves in the\nneck and a pulsatile liver).\n",

In this abnormality, the pulmonary\nartery is connected to the left ventricle and the aorta to the right ventricle.\nThus the systemic and pulmonary circulations are in parallel. This is not\ncompatible with life unless some connection between the two circulations is\npresent. Neonates with the condition will have an atrial septal defect (ASD)\ncreated soon after birth with a catheter-based balloon (balloon septostomy).\nThis allows mixing of the circulations. Later ‘baffles’ are created surgically in\nthe atria to direct blood returning from the body into the right atrium across\nthe ASD and into the left atrium, where it is pumped into the pulmonary\nartery and into the lungs. Blood returning from the lungs into the left atrium\nis directed across into the right atrium and into the morphological right\nventricle and on into the aorta. This means that the morphological right\nventricle is working as the systemic ventricle. This arrangement works very\nwell, but there are long-term concerns about the ability of the right ventricle\nto cope with systemic workloads.\n• Symptoms: symptoms that commonly occur include palpitations caused\n",

If the heart size is more than 50% of the\ntransthoracic diameter, enlargement may be present. Apparent slight cardiac\nenlargement can occur because of a relatively small AP diameter of the chest.\nA cardiothoracic ratio at the upper limit of normal should not cause alarm if\nthe patient has no reason to have cardiac failure and no symptoms of it.\nValve calcification, if present, is better seen on the lateral view. On the\nfrontal view, the valve calcification cannot be visualised over the spine.\nDiaphragm\n \nThe hemidiaphragms visualised on the frontal films are the top of the domes\nseen tangentially. Much lung in the posterior costophrenic angles is not seen\non the frontal film.\nIf the hemidiaphragms are low and flat, emphysema may be present. A\ncritical look must be made beneath the diaphragm to see if there is free\nperitoneal gas (Figure 6.38, page 193).\nLung fields\n \nOn the frontal field, it is convenient to divide the lung fields into zones. It is\neasy then to compare one zone with another for density differences and the\ndistribution of the vascular ‘markings’.\nThe apices lie above the level of the clavicles. The upper zones include\nthe apices and pass down to the level of the second costal cartilages. The\nmid-zones lie between the second and fourth costal cartilage levels. The\nlower zones lie between the fourth and sixth costal cartilages.\nThe radiolucency of the lung fields is due to the air filling the lung. The\n‘greyness’ is due to blood in the pulmonary vessels.\nThe upper zones of the lungs are normally less well perfused, resulting\nin smaller blood vessels. With raised left atrial pressure, there is upper zone\nblood diversion and the vessels are congested.\nAn increase in lung radiolucency occurs with pulmonary vessel loss, as\nalso happens with emphysema. Lung radiolucency is lost with an effusion or\nconsolidation.\nTerms such as opacity, consolidation and patchy shadowing are used to\ndescribe the lung fields.

There are a number of types. A pressure-loaded\n(hyperdynamic, systolic overloaded) apex beat is a forceful and sustained\nimpulse that is not displaced (e.g. aortic stenosis, hypertension). A volume-\nloaded (hyperkinetic, diastolic overloaded) apex beat is a forceful but\nunsustained impulse that is displaced down and laterally (e.g. aortic\nregurgitation, mitral regurgitation). A dyskinetic apex beat (cardiac failure) is\npalpable over a larger area than normal and moves in an uncoordinated way\nunder the examiner’s hand. Do not miss the tapping apex beat of mitral\nstenosis (a palpable first heart sound). The double or triple apical impulse of\nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy is very important too. Feel also for an apical\nthrill, and time it.\nThen palpate with the heel of your hand for a left parasternal impulse\n(which indicates right ventricular enlargement or left atrial enlargement) and\nfor thrills. Now feel at the base of the heart for a palpable pulmonary\ncomponent of the second heart sound (P2) and aortic thrills. Percussion may\nbe helpful if there is uncertainty about cardiac enlargement.\nAuscultation begins in the mitral area with both the bell and the\ndiaphragm. Listen for each component of the cardiac cycle separately.\nIdentify the first and second heart sounds, and decide if they are of normal\nintensity and whether the second heart sound is normally split. Now listen for\nextra heart sounds and for murmurs. Do not be satisfied at having identified\none abnormality.\nRepeat the approach at the left sternal edge and then the base of the\nheart (aortic and pulmonary areas). Time each part of the cycle with the\ncarotid pulse. Listen over the carotids.\nIt is now time to reposition the patient. First put him or her in the left\nlateral position. Again feel the apex beat for character (particularly tapping)\nand auscultate. Sit the patient up and palpate for thrills (with the patient in\nfull expiration) at the left sternal edge and base. Then listen in those areas,\nparticularly for aortic regurgitation or a pericardial rub.\nDynamic auscultation should always be done if there is any doubt about\nthe diagnosis. The Valsalva manoeuvre should be performed whenever there\nis a pure systolic murmur. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is easily missed\notherwise.\nThe patient is now sitting up. Percuss the back quickly to exclude a\npleural effusion (e.g. due to left ventricular failure), and auscultate for\ninspiratory crackles (left ventricular failure). If there is a radiofemoral delay,\nalso listen for a coarctation murmur over the back.

The result is an increase in\nCO2 excretion and the development of alkalosis—a rise in the pH of the\nblood. These patients may complain of variable dyspnoea; they have more\ndifficulty breathing in than out. The alkalosis results in paraesthesiae of the\nfingers and around the mouth, light-headedness, chest pain and a feeling of\nimpending collapse.\nTreatment\n \nIt is important to find out what drugs the patient is using (Table 5.12), how\noften they are taken and whether they are inhaled or swallowed. The\npatient’s previous and current medications may give a clue to the current\ndiagnosis. Bronchodilators and inhaled steroids are prescribed for COPD and\nasthma. A patient’s increased use of bronchodilators suggests poor control of\nasthma and the need for review of treatment.

Some\nmedications known to cause lung disease may not be mentioned by the\npatient because they are illegal (e.g. cocaine), are used sporadically (e.g.\nhydrochlorothiazide), can be obtained over the counter (e.g. tryptophan) or\nare not taken orally (e.g. timolol; beta-blocker eye drops for glaucoma). The\nclinician therefore needs to ask about these types of drug specifically.\nPast history\n \nOne should always ask about previous respiratory illness, including\npneumonia, tuberculosis or chronic bronchitis, or abnormalities of the chest\nX-ray that have previously been reported to the patient. Many previous\nrespiratory investigations may have been memorable, such as bronchoscopy,\nlung biopsy and video-assisted thoracoscopy. Spirometry, with or without\nchallenge testing for asthma, may have been performed. Many severe\nasthmatics perform their own regular peak flow testing (page 128). Ask about\nthe results of any of these investigations. Patients with the acquired\nimmunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have a high risk of developing\nPneumocystis jiroveci (carinii) pneumonia and indeed other chest\ninfections, including tuberculosis.\nOccupational history\n \nIn no system are the patient’s present and previous occupations of more\nimportance (Table 5.13).2 A detailed occupational history is essential. The\noccupational lung diseases or pneumoconioses cause interstitial lung disease\nby damaging the alveoli and small airways.

This can occur as a result of exposure to\nspray paints or plastic or soldering fumes.\nSocial history\n \nA smoking history must be routine, as it is the major cause of COPD and\nlung cancer (see Table 1.2, page 6).

More recently, giant packets\nof 50 have appeared. These are too large to fit into pockets and must be\ncarried in the hands as a constant reminder to the patient of his or her\naddiction.

Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, for\nexample, is an inherited disease, and those affected are extremely susceptible\nto the development of emphysema.

The surface of the lungs is\ncovered by the visceral pleura, a thin membrane, and a similar outer layer\n(the parietal pleura) lines the rib cage. These membranes are separated by a\nthin layer of fluid and enable the lungs to move freely during breathing.\nVarious diseases of the lungs and of the pleura themselves, including\ninfection and malignancy, can cause accumulation of fluid within the pleural\ncavity (a pleural effusion).\nThe heart, trachea, oesophagus and the great blood vessels and nerves\nsit between the lungs and make up the structure called the mediastinum.\nThe left and right pulmonary arteries supply their respective lung. Gas\nexchange occurs in the pulmonary capillaries which surround the alveoli, the\ntiny air sacs which lie beyond the terminal bronchioles. Oxygenated blood is\nreturned via the pulmonary veins to the left atrium. Abnormalities of the\npulmonary circulation such as raised pulmonary venous pressure resulting\nfrom heart failure or pulmonary hypertension can interfere with gas\nexchange.\nThe position of the heart with its apex pointing to the left means that the\nleft lung is smaller than the right and has only two lobes, which are\nseparated by the oblique fissure. The right lung has both horizontal (upper)\nand oblique (lower) fissures dividing it into three lobes (Figure 5 1)\n",

Normal (vesicular) breath sounds are louder\nand longer on inspiration than on expiration and there is no gap between the\ninspiratory and expiratory sounds. They are due to the transmission of air\nturbulence in the large airways filtered through the normal lung to the chest\nwall.\nBronchial breath sounds are present when turbulence in the large\nairways is heard without being filtered by the alveoli, producing a different\nquality.

An inspiratory wheeze implies severe airway\nnarrowing.\nThe pitch (frequency) of wheezes varies. It is determined only by the\nvelocity of the air jet and is not related to the length of the airway. High-\npitched wheezes are produced in the smaller bronchi and have a whistling\nquality, whereas low-pitched wheezes (sometimes called rhonchi) arise from\nthe larger bronchi.\nWheezes are usually the result of acute or chronic airflow obstruction\ndue to asthma (often high-pitched) or COPD (often low-pitched), secondary\nto a combination of bronchial muscle spasm, mucosal oedema and excessive\nsecretions. Wheezes are a poor guide to the severity of airflow obstruction.\nIn severe airways obstruction, wheeze can be absent because ventilation is so\nreduced that the velocity of the air jet is reduced below a critical level\nnecessary to produce the sound.\nA fixed bronchial obstruction, usually due to a carcinoma of the lung,\ntends to cause a localised wheeze, which has a single musical note\n(monophonic) and does not clear with coughing.\nWheezes must be distinguished from stridor (page 118), which sounds\nvery similar to wheeze but is louder over the trachea and is always\ninspiratory (wheezes usually occur in expiration—the majority—but can\noccur in both inspiration and expiration).\nInterrupted non-musical sounds are best called crackles.12,13 There is a\nlot of confusion about the naming of these sounds, perhaps as a result of\nmistranslations of Laënnec. Some authors describe low-pitched crackles as\nrales and high-pitched ones as crepitations, but others do not make this\ndistinction. The simplest approach is to call all these sounds crackles, but also\nto describe their timing and pitch. Crackles are sometimes present in normal\npeople but these crackles will always clear with coughing.\nCrackles are probably the result of loss of stability of peripheral airways\nthat collapse on expiration. With high inspiratory pressures, there is rapid air\nentry into the distal airways. This causes the abrupt opening of alveoli and of\nsmall- or medium-sized bronchi containing secretions in regions of the lung\ndeflated to residual volume. More compliant (distensible) areas open up first,\nfollowed by the increasingly stiff areas. Fine- and medium-pitched crackles\nare not caused by air moving through secretions as was once thought, but by\nthe opening and closing of small airways.\nThe timing of crackles is of great importance. Early inspiratory\ncrackles (cease before the middle of inspiration) suggest disease of the small\nairways, and are characteristic of COPD.12 The crackles are heard only in\nearly inspiration and are of medium coarseness.

Again the patient is asked to take a full breath in, but\nrather than a prolonged expiration, a rapid forced maximal expiratory puff is\nmade through the mouth. The value obtained (the peak expiratory flow,\nPEF) depends largely on airways diameter. Normal values for young men are\napproximately 600 litres a minute and for women 400 litres a minute. The\nvalue depends on age, sex and height, so tables of normal values should be\nconsulted. Airways obstruction, such as that caused by asthma or COPD,\nresults in a reduced and variable PEF. It is a simple way of assessing and\nfollowing patients with airways obstruction, but is rather effort-dependent.\nThe PEF is most useful when used for serial estimates of lung function.\nSpirometry (Figure 5.12)\n \nThe spirometer records graphically or numerically the forced expiratory\nvolume and the forced vital capacity. The forced expiratory volume (FEV) is\nthe volume of air expelled from the lungs after maximum inspiration using\nmaximum forced effort, and is measured in a given time. Usually this is 1\nsecond (FEV1). The forced vital capacity (FVC) is the total volume of air\nexpelled from the lungs after maximum inspiratory effort followed by\nmaximum forced expiration. The FVC is often nearly the same as the vital\ncapacity, but in airways obstruction it may be less because of premature\nairways closure. It is usual to record the best of three attempts and calculate\nthe FEV1/FVC ratio as a percentage. In healthy youth, the normal value is\n80%, but this may decline to as little as 60% in old age.

Small bowel obstruction\ntends to cause more frequent colicky pain (with a cycle every 2–3 minutes)\nthan large bowel obstruction (every 10–15 minutes). Obstruction is often\nassociated with vomiting, constipation and abdominal distension.\nAppetite and weight change\n \nLoss of appetite (anorexia) and weight loss are important gastrointestinal\nsymptoms. The presence of both anorexia and weight loss should make one\nsuspicious of an underlying malignancy, but may also occur with depression\nand in other diseases. The combination of weight loss with an increased\nappetite suggests malabsorption of nutrients or a hypermetabolic state (e.g.\nthyrotoxicosis). It is important to document when the symptoms began and\nhow much weight loss has occurred over this period. Liver disease can\nsometimes cause disturbance of taste. This may cause smokers with acute\nhepatitis and jaundice to give up smoking.\nEarly satiation and postprandial fullness\n \nInability to finish a normal meal (early satiation) may be a symptom of gastric\ndiseases, including gastric cancer and peptic ulcer. A feeling of inappropriate\nfullness after eating can also be a symptom of functional (unexplained)\ngastrointestinal disease.\nNausea and vomiting\n \nNausea is the sensation of wanting to vomit. Heaving and retching may occur\nbut there is no expulsion of gastric contents. There are many possible causes\nfor these complaints. Gastrointestinal tract infections (e.g. from food\npoisoning by Staphylococcus aureus) or small bowel obstruction can cause\nacute symptoms. In patients with chronic symptoms, pregnancy and drugs\n(e.g. digoxin, opiates, dopamine agonists, chemotherapy) should always be\nruled out. In the gastrointestinal tract, peptic ulcer disease with gastric outlet\nobstruction, motor disorders (e.g. gastroparesis from diabetes mellitus, or\nafter gastric surgery), acute hepatobiliary disease and alcoholism are\nimportant causes. Finally, psychogenic vomiting, eating disorders (e.g.\nbulimia) and, rarely, increased intracranial pressure should be considered in\npatients with chronic unexplained nausea and vomiting.\n",

Causes\nof pharyngeal dysphagia can include neurological disease (e.g. motor neurone\ndisease, resulting in bulbar or pseudobulbar palsy).\nIf the patient complains of food sticking in the oesophagus, it is\nimportant to consider a number of anatomical causes of oesophageal\nblockage.1 Ask the patient to point to the site where the solids stick.

However,\nobstruction higher in the oesophagus may be felt anywhere in the retrosternal\narea. If heartburn is also present, for example, this suggests that gastro-\noesophageal reflux with or without stricture formation may be the cause of\nthe dysphagia. The actual course of the dysphagia is also a very important\npart of the history to obtain. If the patient states that the dysphagia is\nintermittent or is present only with the first few swallows of food, this\nsuggests either a lower oesophageal ring or oesophageal spasm. However, if\nthe patient complains of progressive difficulty swallowing, this suggests a\nstricture, carcinoma or achalasia.

This symptom may occur acutely or may\nbe a chronic problem. In many patients, chronic constipation arises because\nof habitual neglect of the impulse to defecate, leading to the accumulation of\nlarge, dry faecal masses. With constant rectal distension from faeces, the\npatient may grow less aware of rectal fullness, leading to chronic\nconstipation. Constipation may arise from ingestion of drugs (e.g. codeine,\nantidepressants and aluminium or calcium antacids), and with various\nmetabolic or endocrine diseases (e.g. hypothyroidism, hypercalcaemia,\ndiabetes mellitus, phaeochromocytoma, porphyria, hypokalaemia) and\nneurological disorders (e.g. aganglionosis, Hirschsprung’sb disease, autonomic\nneuropathy, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis). Constipation can also arise\nafter partial colonic obstruction from carcinoma; it is, therefore, very\nimportant to determine whether there has been a recent change in bowel\nhabit, as this may indicate development of a malignancy. Patients with very\nsevere constipation in the absence of structural disease may be found on a\ntransit study to have slow colonic transit; such slow-transit constipation is\nmost common in young women.\nConstipation is common in the later stages of pregnancy.\nDifficulty with evacuation of faeces may occur with disorders of the\npelvic floor muscles or nerves, or anorectal disease (e.g. fissure, or stricture).\nPatients with this problem may complain of straining, a feeling of anal\nblockage or even the need to self-digitate to perform manual evacuation of\n",

It is thought to be due to interference\nwith the inflow of joint position sense information to the reticular formation\nin the brainstem. This results in rhythmical lapses of postural muscle tone.\nOccasionally the arms, neck, tongue, jaws and eyelids can also be involved.\nIt can be demonstrated if the patient is asked to close the eyes forcefully or\nto protrude the tongue. The flap is usually bilateral, tends to be absent at rest,\nand is brought on by sustained posture. The rhythmic movements are not\nsynchronous on each side and the flap is absent when coma supervenes.\nAlthough this flap is a characteristic and early sign of liver failure, it is\nnot diagnostic: it can also occur in cardiac, respiratory and renal failure, as\nwell as in hypoglycaemia, hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia or barbiturate\nintoxication.\nAn apparent tremor (really a form of choreoathetosis, page 399) may\noccur in Wilson’s disease.

Spider naevi can be caused by cirrhosis, most\nfrequently due to alcohol. In patients with cirrhosis the number of spider\nnaevi may increase or decrease as the patient’s condition changes, as does\npalmar erythema. They may occur transiently with viral hepatitis. During the\nsecond to fifth months of pregnancy, spider naevi frequently appear, only to\ndisappear again within days of delivery. It is not known why they occur only\nin the upper part of the body, but it may be related to the fact that this is the\npart of the body where flushing usually occurs. Like palmar erythema they\nare traditionally attributed to oestrogen excess. Part of the normal hepatic\nfunction is the inactivation of oestrogens, which is impaired in chronic liver\ndisease. Oestrogens are known to have a dilating effect on the spiral arterioles\nof the endometrium, and this has been used to explain the presence of spider\nnaevi, but changes in plasma oestradiol levels have not been found to\ncorrelate with the appearance and disappearance of spider naevi.\nThe differential diagnosis of spider naevi includes Campbell de\nMorganjspots, venous stars and hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia.\nCampbell de Morgan spots are flat or slightly elevated red circular lesions that\noccur on the abdomen or the front of the chest. They do not blanch on\npressure and are very common. Venous stars are 2- to 3-cm lesions that can\noccur on the dorsum of the feet, legs, back and the lower chest.

However, the abdominal\naorta can often be seen to pulsate in normal thin people.\nVisible peristalsis may occur occasionally in very thin normal people;\nhowever, it usually suggests intestinal obstruction. Pyloric obstruction due to\npeptic ulceration or tumour may cause visible peristalsis, seen as a slow wave\nof movement passing across the upper abdomen from left to right.\nObstruction of the distal small bowel can cause similar movements in a ladder\npattern in the centre of the abdomen.\nSkin lesions should also be noted on the abdominal wall. These include\nthe vesicles of herpes zoster, which occur in a radicular pattern (they are\nlocalised to only one side of the abdomen in the distribution of a single nerve\nroot). Herpes zoster may be responsible for severe abdominal pain that is of\nmysterious origin until the rash appears. The Sister Josephr nodule is a\nmetastatic tumour deposit in the umbilicus, the anatomical region where the\nperitoneum is closest to the skin. Discoloration of the umbilicus where a\nfaintly bluish hue is present is found rarely, in cases of extensive\nhaemoperitoneum and acute pancreatitis (Cullen’s signs—the umbilical ‘black\neye’). Skin discoloration may also rarely occur in the flanks in severe cases\nof acute pancreatitis (Grey-Turner’s signt).\nStretching of the abdominal wall severe enough to cause rupture of the\nelastic fibres in the skin produces pink linear marks with a wrinkled\nappearance, which are called striae. When these are wide and purple-\ncoloured, Cushing’s syndrome may be the cause (page 309). Ascites,\npregnancy or recent weight gain are much more common causes of striae.\nNext, squat down beside the bed so that the patient’s abdomen is at eye\nlevel.

Bowel\nsounds can be heard over all parts of the abdomen in normal healthy people.\nThey are poorly localised and there is little point in listening for them in more\nthan one place. Most bowel sounds originate in the stomach, some from the\nlarge bowel and the rest from the small bowel. They have a soft gurgling\ncharacter and occur only intermittently. Bowel sounds should be described as\neither present or absent; the terms ‘decreased’ or ‘increased’ are meaningless\nbecause the sounds vary, depending on when a meal was last eaten.\nComplete absence of any bowel sounds over a 4-minute period indicates\nparalytic ileus (this is complete absence of peristalsis in a paralysed bowel).\nAs only liquid is present in the gut, the heart sounds may be audible over the\nabdomen, transmitted by the dilated bowel.\nThe bowel that is obstructed produces a louder and higher-pitched\nsound with a tinkling quality due to the presence of air and liquid (‘obstructed\nbowel sounds’).

      "text": "Venous hums\n \nA venous hum is a continuous, low-pitched, soft murmur that may become\nlouder with inspiration and diminish when more pressure is applied to the\nstethoscope. Typically it is heard between the xiphisternum and the umbilicus\nin cases of portal hypertension, but is rare. It may radiate to the chest or over\nto the liver. Large volumes of blood flowing in the umbilical or para-umbilical\nveins in the falciform ligament are responsible. These channel blood from the\nleft portal vein to the epigastric or internal mammary veins in the abdominal\nwall. A venous hum may occasionally be heard over the large vessels such as\nthe inferior mesenteric vein or after portacaval shunting. Sometimes a thrill is\ndetectable over the site of maximum intensity of the hum. The Cruveilhier-\nBaumgarteny syndrome is the association of a venous hum at the umbilicus\nand dilated abdominal wall veins. It is almost always due to cirrhosis of the\nliver. It occurs when patients have a patent umbilical vein, which allows\nportal-to-systemic shunting at this site. The presence of a venous hum or of\nprominent central abdominal veins suggests that the site of portal obstruction\nis intrahepatic rather than in the portal vein itself.\nBruits\n \nUncommonly, an arterial systolic bruit can be heard over the liver. This\nsound is higher pitched than a venous hum, is not continuous and is well\nlocalised. This is usually due to a hepatocellular cancer but may occur in\nacute alcoholic hepatitis, with an arteriovenous malformation, or transiently\nafter a liver biopsy. Auscultation for renal bruits on either side of the midline\nabove the umbilicus is indicated if renal artery stenosis is suspected. A bruit\nin the epigastrium may be heard in patients with chronic intestinal ischaemia\nfrom mesenteric arterial stenosis, but may also occur in the absence of\npathology.

Pay careful attention to scars from\nprevious surgery, which may be difficult to see. Look for obvious lumps and\nswellings.

The patient is then asked to cough again with the\nexaminer inspecting the opposite side.\nOf key importance is the position of a hernia in relation to the pubic\ntubercle, which can usually easily be felt lateral to the symphysis pubis (2–3\ncm from the midline). In the obese individual, it may be difficult to locate the\npubic tubercle and in such situations if the thigh is flexed and abducted, the\nadductor longus muscle can be traced proximally, leading the examiner to the\npubic tubercle.\nPalpation is commenced with the gloved fingers being placed over the\nregion of the pubic tubercle. Once again the patient is asked to cough and a\npalpable expansile impulse is sought. If a hernia is present, attempts at\nreduction should not be performed while the patient is erect, as it is more\ndifficult and painful than when the patient is placed supine.\nThe patient is then asked to lie supine on the examination couch.

The entrance of this tract may be visible, usually within\n4 cm of the anus. The mouth has a red pouting appearance caused by\ngranulation tissue. This may occur with Crohn’s disease or perianal abscess\n(page 191).\n6. Condylomata acuminata (anal warts) may be confused with skin\ntags, but are in fact pedunculated papillomas with a white surface and red\nbase. They may surround the anus.\n7. Carcinoma of the anus. This may be visible as a fungating mass at the\nanal verge.\n8. Pruritus ani. The appearance of this irritating anal condition varies from\nweeping red dermatitis to a thickened white skin. It is usually caused by\nfaecal soiling.\n9. Excoriation as a result of inflammation or contact dermatitis caused\nby faeces—diarrhoea.\nNext ask the patient to strain and watch the perineum: look for\nincontinence and leakage of faeces or mucus, abnormal descent of the\nperineum or the presence of a patulous anus. The presence of a gaping anus\noften correlates with lower resting pressures on anorectal manometry.\nInternal haemorrhoids can prolapse in the right anterior, right posterior and\nleft lateral positions.\nIf there is rectal prolapse, straining may cause a dark red mass to appear\nat the anal verge; mucosal prolapse causes the appearance of radial folds and\nconcentric folds are a sign of complete prolapse. This mass is continuous\nwith the perianal skin and is usually painless. In cases of mucosal rectal\nprolapse, the prolapsed mucosa can be felt between the examiner’s thumb\nand forefinger.\nNow test the anal wink. Stroke a cotton pad in all four quadrants around\nthe anus. Usually you will see a brisk anal contraction which indicates the\nsacral nerve pathways are intact. Sometimes the response is weak in healthy\npeople. However, the complete absence of an anal wink, particularly in the\nsetting of faecal incontinence, suggests that there is a spinal cord problem and\nindicates the need to perform a more detailed neurological examination and\nconsider further investigations accordingly.\nNow the time for action has come.

If\nthere is excruciating pain at the start of the examination, this strongly suggests\nthat there is an anal fissure and the remainder of the rectal examination\nshould be abandoned. Often the fissure can be seen on inspection. An anal\nfissure can precipitate constipation but may be secondary to constipation\nitself. By liberally lubricating the rectum with lignocaine jelly, it may still be\npossible to complete the rest of the examination, but usually it is better to\nperform anoscopy under appropriate sedation for these patients. Other causes\nof significant anal pain during palpation include recently thrombosed external\nhaemorrhoids, an ischiorectal abscess, active proctitis, or anal ulceration from\nanother cause.\nSlowly increasing pressure is applied with the pulp of the finger until the\nsphincter is felt to relax slightly. At this stage the finger is advanced into the\nrectum slowly. During entry, sphincter tone should be assessed as normal or\nreduced. The accuracy of this assessment has been questioned in the past,\nbut more recently has been shown to correlate well with anorectal\nmanometry measurements.20 This resting tone is predominantly (70%–80%)\nattributable to the internal anal sphincter muscle. Reduced sphincter tone may\nindicate a sphincter tear. A high anal resting tone may contribute to\ndifficulties with evacuation.\nPalpation of the anterior wall of the rectum for the prostate gland in the\nmale and for the cervix in the female is performed first. The normal prostate\nis a firm, rubbery bilobed mass with a central furrow. It becomes firmer with\nage. With prostatic enlargement, the sulcus becomes obliterated and the gland\nis often asymmetrical. A very hard nodule is apparent when a carcinoma of\nthe prostate is present. The prostate is boggy and tender in prostatitis. A mass\nabove the prostate or cervix may indicate a metastatic deposit on Blumer’s\nshelf.aa\nThe finger is then rotated clockwise so that the left lateral wall, posterior\nwall and right lateral wall of the rectum can be palpated in turn. Then the\nfinger is advanced as high as possible into the rectum and slowly withdrawn\nalong the rectal wall. A soft lesion, such as a small rectal carcinoma or polyp,\nis more likely to be felt this waybb (Table 6.18).

Second, press on the\nposterior rectal wall and ask if this causes pain; this suggests puborectalis\nmuscle tenderness, which can also occur in pelvic floor dyssynergia. Third,\nassess whether the anal sphincter and the puborectalis contract when you ask\nyour patient to contract or squeeze the pelvic floor muscles. Puborectalis\ncontraction is perceived as a ‘lift’; that is, the muscle lifts the examining\nfinger toward the umbilicus. Many patients with faecal incontinence cannot\naugment anal pressure when asked to squeeze. Finally, place your other hand\non the anterior abdominal wall while asking the patient to strain again. This\nprovides some information on whether the patient is excessively contracting\nthe abdominal wall (e.g. by performing an inappropriate Valsalva manoeuvre)\nand perhaps also the pelvic floor muscles while attempting to defaecate,\nwhich may impede evacuation. However, the exact value of this test is\nunclear.\nConstipation that is due to pelvic floor dysfunction responds to\nbiofeedback in about 70% of cases, and this treatment can result in a\nlaxative-free existence for patients with troubling outlet constipation; the\ndiagnosis should be entertained in all patients with chronic constipation, and a\ngood rectal examination can help guide you as to whether anorectal\nmanometry testing is warranted.\nAfter the finger has been withdrawn, the glove is inspected for bright\nblood or melaena, mucus or pus, and the colour of the faeces is noted.\nHaemorrhoids are not palpable unless thrombosed. Persistent gaping of the\nanal canal after withdrawal of the examining finger may indicate external anal\nsphincter denervation.\nProctosigmoidoscopy\n \nThe examination of the rectum with a sigmoidoscope is an essential part of\nthe physical examination of any patient with symptoms referable to the\nanorectal region or large bowel. The principal indications include rectal\nbleeding, chronic diarrhoea, constipation or change in bowel habit. It should\nalso be performed in some patients with abdominal pain, before treatment is\nbegun for any anorectal condition, and before a barium enema is ordered for\nany reason.\nThe examination can be performed without anaesthesia, except in\npatients who have a very painful anal condition.\nProcedure\n \nBegin by inspecting the anal area as outlined earlier.

Part of the assessment\nshould include inspection of the vomitus and stools (pages 183–184) and a\nrectal examination. Remember that, of patients with chronic liver disease and\nupper gastrointestinal bleeding, only about half are bleeding from varices.\nThe others are usually bleeding from peptic ulceration (either acute or\nchronic). Look for evidence of a bleeding diathesis.\nFinally, examine the patient for any evidence of skin lesions that can be\nassociated with vascular anomalies in the gastrointestinal tract, although these\nare rare (Tables 6.3, 6.4). For example, pseudoxanthoma elasticum is an\nautosomal recessive disorder of elastic fibres that results in xanthoma-like\nyellowish nodules, particularly in the axillae or neck.

This will avoid causing the patient pain and may also\nprovide a clue to a site of possible pathology. Next palpate each region more\ndeeply; then feel specifically for hepatomegaly and splenomegaly.

Always roll\nthe patient onto the right side and palpate again if the spleen is not felt\ninitially. Attempt now to feel the kidneys bimanually. Remember the\nimportant distinguishing features of a spleen as opposed to a kidney.\nPercuss routinely for ascites. If the abdomen is resonant right out to the\nflanks, do not roll the patient over. Otherwise test for shifting dullness. This\nis performed by percussing away from your side of the bed until you reach a\ndull note. Then roll the patient towards you and, after waiting a minute or\nso, begin percussing again for resonance.\nB y auscultation note the presence of bowel sounds. Next auscultate\nbriefly over the liver, spleen and renal areas, listening for bruits, hums and\nrubs.\nExamine \nthe groin next. Palpate for inguinal lymphadenopathy.\nExamine for hernias by asking the patient to stand and then cough. The testes\nmust always be palpated. Now look at the legs for oedema and bruising.\nNeurological examination of the legs may be indicated if there are signs of\nchronic liver disease.\nIf the liver is enlarged or cirrhosis is suspected ask the patient to sit up\nto 45 degrees and estimate the jugular venous pressure. This will avoid\nmissing constrictive pericarditis or chronic cardiac failure as a cause of liver\ndisease, or haemochromatosis, which can cause a dilated cardiomyopathy.\nWhile the patient is sitting up, palpate in the supraclavicular fossae for lymph\nnodes and feel at the back for sacral oedema. If ascites is present, it is\nnecessary to examine the chest for a pleural effusion. If malignant disease is\nsuspected, examine all lymph node groups, the breasts and the lungs.\nA rectal examination should always be considered and specimens of the\npatient’s vomitus or faeces should be inspected, if available.

Renal infection may be difficult to distinguish\nclinically from lower UTIs but is a more serious condition and more likely to\ninvolve systemic complications such as septicaemia.\nUrinary tract infection is much more common in women than in men,\nbut there are a number of risk factors for the disease (Table 7.4). It can be\nstrongly suspected on the basis of the patient’s symptoms.2 These include:\ndysuria (pain or stinging during urination), frequency (need to pass small\namounts of urine frequently), haematuria, and loin (more suggestive of upper\nUTI) or back pain. Physical examination may reveal fevers, rigors, lower\nabdominal discomfort and loin pain when the renal angle is balloted\nposteriorly. The latter findings are more suggestive of complicated UTI or\npyelonephritis. The presence of a vaginal discharge is against the diagnosis.\nElderly patients with a urinary tract infection often present with confusion\nand few other symptoms or signs.

The patient may have noticed hesitancy\n(difficulty starting micturition—urination), followed by a decrease in the size\nof the stream of urine and terminal dribbling of urine.

Obstruction is associated with an increased risk of urinary\ninfection.\nRenal calculi can cause ureteric obstruction (Figure 7.4). The presenting\nsymptom here, however, is usually severe colicky or constant loin or lower\nquadrant pain which may radiate down towards the symphysis pubis or\nperineum or testis (renal colic). Urinary obstruction can be a cause of acute\nrenal failure (kidney injury) (Table 7.5).\nFigure 7.4 Renal calculus\nPhleboliths (calcifications related to blood vessels) are rounded opacities seen in the pelvis\nbelow the level of the ischial spines, whereas ureteric calculi lie above this level, in the line of\nthe ureters.

Excretion of potassium depends in part on urine volume. Hyperkalaemia\nusually becomes a problem when a patient is oliguric (passes less than 400\nmL urine/day) and may occur when taking potassium-sparing diuretics or\nagents that promote potassium retention (ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor\nblockers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).\n6.

This may be due to impaired excretion of\nurinary pigments (urochromes) combined with anaemia. The skin colour may\nbe from slate grey to bronze, due to iron deposition in dialysis patients who\nhave received multiple blood transfusions, but these signs are becoming less\nfrequent with the use of exogenous erythropoietin. In terminal renal failure,\npatients become drowsy and finally sink into a coma due to nitrogen or toxin\nretention. Twitching due to myoclonic jerks, and tetany and epileptic seizures\ndue to neuromuscular irritability or a low serum calcium level, occur late in\nrenal failure. Over-vigorous correction of acidosis (e.g. with bicarbonate\ninfusions) may also precipitate seizures and coma. There may be typical skin\nnodules related to calcium phosphate deposition.\nIt is essential to assess the state of fluid balance in all patients with renal\ndisease. Severe fluid-volume depletion can be a cause of acute renal failure\nand can cause precipitous decompensation in patients with chronic renal\nfailure. Conversely, volume excess can result from intravenous infusions of\nfluid used in an attempt to correct acute renal failure, resulting in pulmonary\noedema. Patients should be weighed regularly as an objective measure of\ntheir fluid status.\nThe distinctive ketone-like smell of a UTI may be apparent.

Half-and-half nails (distal nail brown or red, proximal nail pink\nor white) are also seen in chronic renal failure.

It should be noted that specific gravity by dipstick is pH\ndependent and insensitive to nonionised molecules, and therefore correlates\npoorly with urine osmolality.\npH\n \nNormal urine is acid, except after meals when for a short time it becomes\nalkaline (the alkaline tide). Measuring the pH of urine is helpful in a number\nof critical circumstances. Sometimes the urine has to be made alkaline for\ntherapeutic purposes, such as treating myoglobinuria or recurrent urinary\ncalculi due to uric acid or cystine. Distal renal tubular acidosis should be\nsuspected if the early morning urine is consistently alkaline and cannot be\nacidified. Urinary tract infections with ureasplitting organisms, such as\nProteus mirabilis, can also cause an alkaline urine which, in turn, favours\nrenal struvite stone formation.\nProtein\n \nThe colours are compared with a chart provided. The strip tests give only a\nsemi-quantitative measure of urinary protein (+ to ++++) and, if positive,\nmust be confirmed by other tests. It is very important to note that the\ndipstick is sensitive to albumin but not to other proteins. A reading of + of\nproteinuria may be normal, as up to 150 mg of protein a day is lost in the\nurine. Causes of abnormal amounts of protein in the urine are listed in Tables\n7.11 and 7.12.

They are signs of a damaged glomerular basement\nmembrane or damaged tubules. The size of a cast is determined by the\ndimension of the lumen of the nephron in which it forms. The presence of\ncasts is a very important abnormality and means renal disease.\nHyaline casts are long cylindrical structures. One or two RBCs or\nWBCs may be present in the cast. Normally there are fewer than 1 per lpf.\nThey consist largely of Tamm-Horsfall mucoprotein secreted by the renal\ntubules.\nGranular casts are abnormal cylindrical granular structures that arise\nfrom the tubules, usually in patients with proteinuria.

They contain 10 to 50\nred cells, which are well defined.\nWith white cell casts many WBCs adhere to or inside the cast.

Inspect for oedema of the skin, sebaceous cysts, tinea cruris (an\nerythematous rash caused by a fungal infection of the moist skin of the groin)\nor scabies. Scrotal oedema is common in severe cardiac failure and may\noccur with the nephrotic syndrome and ascites.\nPalpate each testis gently using the fingers and thumb of the right hand\nor cradle the testis between the middle and index fingers of the right hand and\npalpate it with the ipsilateral thumb.13 The testes are normally equal in size,\nsmooth and relatively firm. Absence of one or both testes may be due to\nprevious excision, failure of the testis to descend, or a retractile testis. In\nchildren the testes may retract as examination of the scrotum begins because\nof a marked cremasteric reflex. A maldescended testis (one that lies\npermanently in the inguinal canal or higher) has a high chance of developing\nmalignancy. An exquisitely tender, indurated testis suggests orchitis. 14 This is\noften due to mumps in postpubertal patients and occurs about 5 days after\nthe parotitis. An undescended testis may be palpable in the inguinal canal,\nusually at or above the external inguinal ring.

Waldeyer’s ring f is a circle of lymphatic\ntissue in the posterior part of the oropharynx and nasopharynx, and includes\nthe tonsils and adenoids. Sometimes non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma will involve\nWaldeyer’s tonsillar ring, but Hodgkin’s disease rarely does.\nCervical and supraclavicular nodes\n \nSit the patient up and examine the cervical nodes from behind. There are\neight groups. Attempt to identify each of the groups of nodes with your\nfingers (Figure 8.7). First palpate the submental node, which lies directly\nunder the chin, and then the submandibular nodes, which are below the angle\nof the jaw. Next palpate the jugular chain, which lies anterior to the\nsternomastoid muscle, and then the posterior triangle nodes, which are\nposterior to the sternomastoid muscle. Palpate the occipital region for\noccipital nodes and then move to the postauricular node behind the ear and\nthe preauricular node in front of the ear. Finally from the front, with the\npatient’s shoulders slightly shrugged, feel in the supraclavicular fossa and at\nthe base of the sternocleidomastoid muscle for the supraclavicular nodes.\nCauses of lymphadenopathy, localised and generalised, are given in Table\n8.7.

All these diseases can result in secondary polycythaemia.\nThe arms should be inspected for scratch marks; post-bathing pruritus\noccurs in polycythaemia rubra vera, possibly due to basophil histamine\nrelease. Take the blood pressure: very rarely a phaeochromocytoma will\ncause secondary polycythaemia and hypertension.\nExamine the eyes. Look for injected conjunctivae. Fundal\nhyperviscosity changes, including engorged, dilated retinal veins and\nhaemorrhages, may be present. Inspect the tongue for central cyanosis.\nExamine the cardiovascular system for signs of cyanotic congenital heart\ndisease and the respiratory system for signs of chronic lung disease. The\nabdomen must be carefully assessed for splenomegaly, which occurs in 80%\nof cases of polycythaemia rubra vera but does not usually occur with the\nother causes of polycythaemia. There may be evidence of chronic liver\ndisease or hepatocellular carcinoma, which may cause secondary\npolycythaemia. Palpate for the kidneys and perform a urinalysis. In women\npalpate the uterus. Polycystic kidney disease, hydronephrosis, renal\ncarcinoma and uterine fibromata can all rarely cause secondary\npolycythaemia.\nThe legs must be inspected for scratch marks, gouty tophi (Figure 9.57,\npage 282) and arthropathy, as well as for signs of peripheral vascular disease.\nIn polycythaemia rubra vera, secondary gout occurs due to the increased\ncellular turnover resulting in hyperuricaemia. Peripheral vascular disease\noccurs in polycythaemia rubra vera because of thrombosis (as there is\nincreased platelet adhesiveness and accelerated atherosclerosis) and slowed\ncirculation due to hyperviscosity.\nLook for cerebellar signs, which may be due to the presence of a\ncerebellar \nhaemangioblastoma, \na \nvery \nrare \ncause \nof \nsecondary\npolycythaemia. Examine the central nervous system for signs of a stroke due\nto thrombosis.\nPrimary myelofibrosis\n",

The distribution of the change of sensation should help to\ndistinguish nerve damage or entrapment (a specific distribution) from\nischaemia.\nBack pain\n \nThis is a very common symptom. It is most often a consequence of local\nmusculoskeletal disease.\nAsk where the pain is situated, whether it began suddenly or gradually,\nwhether it is localised or diffuse, whether it radiates to the limbs or\nelsewhere, and whether the pain is aggravated by movement, coughing or\nstraining. Musculoskeletal pain is characteristically well localised and is\naggravated by movement. If there is a spinal nerve root irritation there may\nbe pain that occurs in a dermatomal distribution. This helps to localise the\nlevel of the lesion. Diseases such as osteoporosis (with crush fractures),\ninfiltration of carcinoma, leukaemia or myeloma may cause progressive and\nunremitting back pain, which is often worse at night (Table 9.6). The pain\nmay be of sudden onset but is usually self-limiting if it results from the crush\nfracture of a vertebral body. In ankylosing spondylitis the pain is usually\nsituated over the sacroiliac joints and lumbar spine, it is also worse at night\nand is associated with morning stiffness. The pain of ankylosing spondylitis is\ntypically better with activity which helps distinguish it from mechanical back\npain.1,2 Pain from diseases of the abdomen and chest (e.g. dissecting\n",

Extra-articular disease causes variable limitation of movement in\ndifferent directions, and tends to cause more limitation of active than of\npassive movement.\nThe rheumatological examination\n \nThere are certain established ways of examining the joints and related\nstructures3 and it is important to be aware of the numerous systemic\ncomplications of rheumatological diseases. The actual system of examination\ndepends on the patient’s history and sometimes on the examiner noticing an\nabnormality on general inspection. Formal examination of all the joints is\nrarely part of the routine physical examination, but students should learn how\nto handle each joint properly and a formal examination is an important part of\nthe evaluation of patients who present with joint symptoms or who have an\nestablished diagnosis and active symptoms. Diseases of the extra-articular\nsoft tissues are particularly common.\nGeneral inspection\n \nThis is important for two reasons: first, it gives an indication of the patient’s\nfunctional disability, which is essential in all rheumatological assessments; and\nsecond, certain conditions can be diagnosed by careful inspection. Look at\nthe patient as he or she walks into the room. Does walking appear to be\npainful and difficult? What posture is taken? Does the patient require\nassistance such as a stick or walking frame? Is there obvious deformity, and\nwhat joints does it involve? Note the pattern of joint involvement, which\ngives a clue about the likely underlying disease (Tables 9.2 to 9.4).\nFor a more detailed examination the patient should be undressed as far\nas practical, usually to the underclothes. Depending on the patient’s condition\nand the parts of the body to be examined, the examination may best be begun\nwith the patient in bed, or sitting over the side of the bed or in a chair, or\nstanding. The opportunity of watching the patient remove the clothes should\nnot be lost because arthritis can interfere with this essential daily task.\nPrinciples of joint examination\n \nCertain general rules apply to the examination of all the joints and they can\nbe summarised as: look, feel, move, measure, and compare with the opposite\nside.\n",

      "text": "Look\n \nThe first principle is always to compare right with left. Remember that joints\nare three-dimensional structures and need to be inspected from the front, the\nback and the sides. The skin is inspected for erythema indicating underlying\ninflammation and suggesting active, intense arthritis or infection, atrophy\nsuggesting chronic underlying disease, scars indicating previous operations\nsuch as tendon repairs or joint replacements, and rashes. For example,\npsoriasis is associated with a rash and polyarthritis (inflammation of more\nthan one joint). The psoriatic rash consists of scaling erythematous plaques\non extensor surfaces. The nails are often also affected (page 252). Also look\nfor a vasculitic skin rash (inflammation of the blood vessels of the skin),\nwhich can range in appearance from palpable purpura or livedo reticularis\n(bluish-purple streaks in a net-like pattern) to skin necrosis.\nA small, firm, painless swelling over the back (dorsal surface) of the\nwrist is usually a synovial cyst—a ganglion.c A larger, localised, soft area of\nswelling of the dorsum of the wrist generally indicates tenosynovitis.\nNote any swelling over the joint. There are a number of possible\ncauses: these include effusion into the joint space, hypertrophy and\ninflammation of the synovium (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis), or bony\novergrowths at the joint margins (e.g. osteoarthritis). It may also occur when\ntissues around the joints become involved, as with the tendinitis or bursitis of\nrheumatoid arthritis. Swelling of the lower legs may be due to fluid retention,\nwhich is painless and can occur in association with inflammation anywhere in\nthe leg. Painful swelling may result from inflammation of the ankle joints or\ntendons, or of the fascia, or from inflammatory oedema of the skin and\nsubcutaneous tissue.\nDeformity is the sign of a chronic, usually destructive, arthritis, and\nranges from mild ulnar deviation of the metacarpophalangeal joints in early\nrheumatoid arthritis to the gross destruction and disorganisation of a\ndenervated (Charcot’sd) joint (Figure 10.20, page 319). Deviation of the part\nof the body away from the midline is called valgus deformity, and towards\nthe midline, varus deformity. For example, genu valgum means knock-kneed\nand genu varum, bow-legged.\nLook for abnormal bone alignment. Subluxation is said to be present\nwhen displaced parts of the joint surfaces remain partly in contact.\nDislocation is used to describe displacement where there is loss of contact\nbetween the joint surfaces.\nMuscle wasting results from a combination of disuse of the joint,\ninflammation of the surrounding tissues and sometimes nerve entrapment.

This is done traditionally with the backs of the\nfingers where temperature appreciation is said to be better. A cool joint is\nunlikely to be involved in an acute inflammatory process. A swollen and\nwarm joint may be affected by active synovitis (see below), infection (e.g.\nStaphylococcus) or crystal arthritis (e.g. gout).\nTenderness is a guide to the acuteness of the inflammation, but may be\npresent over the muscles of patients with fibromyalgia. The patient must be\ntold to let the examiner know if the examination is becoming uncomfortable.\nTenderness can be graded as follows:\nGrade I—patient complains of pain\nGrade II—patient complains of pain and winces\nGrade III—patient complains of pain, winces and withdraws the joint\nGrade IV—patient does not allow palpation.\nThis may result from joint inflammation or from lesions outside the\njoints (periarticular tissues), including inflamed tendons, bursae, or\nattachments (entheses). Infected joints are extremely tender and patients will\noften not let the examiner move the joint at all. Palpation of a joint or area\nfor tenderness must be performed gently, and the patient’s face rather than\nthe joint itself should be watched for signs that the examination is\nuncomfortable.\nPalpate the joint deliberately now, if possible, for evidence of synovitis,\nwhich is a soft and spongy (boggy) swelling. This must be distinguished from\nan effusion, which tends to affect large joints but can occur in any joint. Here\nthe swelling is fluctuant and can be made to shift within the joint.

Passive\nmovement of the spine is not a practical manoeuvre (unless the examiner is\nvery strong), and active movement is tested here. Active movement is more\nhelpful in assessing integrated joint function. Hand function and gait are\nusually applied as tests of function. Pain on motion indicates a joint or\nperiarticular problem.\nStability of the joint is important and depends largely on the\nsurrounding ligaments. This is tested by attempting to move the joint gently\nin abnormal directions to its usual limits, set by ligaments and muscular tone.\nJoint crepitus, which is a grating sensation or noise from the joint,\nindicates irregularity of the articular surfaces. Its presence suggests\nchronicity.\nMeasure\n \nAccurate measurement of the range of movement of a joint is possible with a\ngoniometer, which is a hinged rod with a protractor in the centre. The jaws\nare opened and lined up with the joint. Measurement of joint movements is\nperformed from the zero starting position. For most joints this is the\nanatomical position in extension—e.g. the straightened knee. Movement is\nthen recorded as the number of degrees of flexion from this position. A knee\nwith a fixed flexion deformity may be recorded as ‘30 to 60 degrees’, which\nindicates that there is 30 degrees of fixed flexion deformity and that flexion is\nlimited to 60 degrees. At some joints both flexion and extension from the\nanatomical position can be measured, as at the wrists. The goniometer is not\nroutinely used by non-rheumatologists and there is a wide range of normal\nvalues for joint movement.

It is more likely to be vague\nor diffuse if it has radiated from the shoulder or neck or is due to carpal\ntunnel syndrome, and to be localised if it is due to arthritis. Stiffness is\ntypically worse in the mornings in rheumatoid arthritis. Swelling of the wrist\nmay indicate arthritis or tendon sheath inflammation. Swelling of individual\njoints suggests arthritis. Deformity of the fingers and hand due to rheumatoid\narthritis or of the fingers as a result of arthritis or gouty tophi may be the\npresenting complaint. The sudden onset of deformity suggests tendon\nrupture. Locking or snapping of a finger (trigger finger) is typical of\ninflammation of a flexor tendon sheath (tenovaginitis). Loss of function is a\nserious problem when it involves the numerous functions of the hand and\nwrist. The history should include an assessment of the difficulties the patient\nhas in using the hands and wrists. Neurological symptoms as a result of\nnerve compression may cause paraesthesiae or limitation of strength or of\ncomplicated hand functions.\nExamination\n \nFirst sit the patient over the side of the bed and place the hands on the pillow\nwith palms down. Often examination of the hands alone will give enough\ninformation for the examiner to make a diagnosis. As a result this is quite a\npopular test in viva voce examinations.\nL\nk\n",

Again note any skin changes and joint swelling. Look for the\ncharacteristic deformities of rheumatoid arthritis. These include swan neck\nand boutonnière deformity of the fingers and Z deformity of the thumb\n(Figure 9.10). They are due to joint destruction and tendon dysfunction. The\nswan neck deformity is hyperextension at the proximal interphalangeal joint\nand fixed flexion deformity at the distal interphalangeal joint. It is due to\nsubluxation at the proximal interphalangeal joint and tendon shortening at the\ndistal interphalangeal joint. The boutonnière (buttonhole) deformity consists\nof fixed flexion of the proximal interphalangeal joint and extension of the\ndistal interphalangeal joints.

Loss of function may result in difficulty using the arms at\nabove shoulder height or reaching around to the back.\nExamination\n \nWatch the patient undressing and note forward, backward and upward\nmovements of the shoulders and whether these seem limited or cause the\npatient pain. Stand back and compare the two sides. The arms should be held\nat the same level and the outlines of the acromioclavicular joints should be\nthe same. There may be wasting of one of the deltoid muscles that will not\nbe obvious unless the two are compared.\nLook at the joint. A swelling may be visible anteriorly, but unless\neffusions are large and the patient is thin these are difficult to detect. Look\nfor asymmetry and for scars as a result of injury or previous surgery.\nFeel for tenderness and swelling.

For the right shoulder the examiner stands behind the patient resting\nthe left hand on the patient’s shoulder, while the right hand abducts the\nelbow from the shoulder.

      "text": "Figure 9.28 Apley scratch test to assess shoulder movements\n \nThe anterior stability of the shoulder joint is best assessed by the\n‘apprehension’ test. Stand behind the patient, abduct, extend and externally\nrotate the shoulder (Figure 9.27c) while pushing the head of the humerus\nforwards with the thumb. The patient will strongly resist this manoeuvre if\nthere is impending dislocation. There will be a similar response if the arm is\nadducted and internally rotated and posterior dislocation is about to occur.\nThis is also the time to test biceps function. The patient flexes the elbow\nagainst resistance. A ruptured biceps tendon causes the biceps muscle to roll\nup into a ball.\nAs a general rule, intra-articular disease produces painful limitation of\nmovement in all directions, while tendinitis produces painful limitation of\nmovement in one plane only, and tendon rupture or neurological lesions\nproduce painless weakness. For example, if the abnormal sign is limited\nshoulder abduction in the middle range (45–135 degrees), this suggests\n‘rotator cuff’ problems (i.e. the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis\nand teres minor muscles) rather than arthritis.\nIn bicipital tendinitis there is localised tenderness on palpating over the\ngroove. The supraspinatus tendon is a little higher, just under the anterior\nsurface of the acromion. Supraspinatus tendinitis is common. Testing for it\ninvolves placing a finger over the head of the tendon while the shoulder is in\nextension. As this pushes the tendon forwards against the examiner’s finger,\nthe movement is painful. When the shoulder is then flexed the tendon moves\naway and the pain disappears.\nDon’t forget that arthritis affecting the acromioclavicular joint can be\nconfused with glenohumeral disorders. Also remember to examine the neck\nand axillae in patients with shoulder pain.\nThe temporomandibular joints\n",

Musculoskeletal neck pain usually\narises in the structures at the back of the neck: the cervical spine, the\nsplenius, semispinalis and trapezius muscles, or in the cervical nerves or\nnerve roots. Pain in the front of the neck may come from the oesophagus,\ntrachea, thyroid gland or anterior neck muscles e.g. the sternocleidomastoid\nand platysma. Pain may be referred to the front of the neck from the heart.\nThere may be a history of trauma from direct injury or a sudden\ndeceleration causing hyperextension of the neck; ‘whiplash’ injury. Injury\ncan also be caused by attempted therapeutic neck manipulations by\nphysiotherapists or chiropractors. The possibility of spinal cord injury must\nbe considered in these patients. Ask about weakness or altered sensation in\nthe arms and legs and any problem with bowel or bladder function.\nThe pain may have begun suddenly, suggesting a disc prolapse, or more\ngradually due to disc degeneration.\nPostural tendon and muscle strains are common causes of temporary\nneck pain. These are often related to overuse. Ask for the patient’s\noccupation and whether work or recreational activities involve repeated and\nprolonged extension of the neck, e.g. painters and bicyclists. These patients\noften describe neck stiffness, and pain and muscle spasm are often present.\nThe repeated holding of a telephone between the shoulder and the ear can\ncause nerve root problems. Neck movement may cause radicular symptoms\nsuch as paraesthesiae in the distribution of a cervical nerve after a\nhyperextension injury or cervical spine arthritis. Ask about paraesthesiae and\nweakness in the arms and hands.\nDeformity may occur as a result of muscle spasm or sometimes\nfollowing disc prolapse.

It tends to be worse after inactivity. Locking of the knee\nusually means there is a sudden inability to reach full extension. The knee is\noften stuck at about 45 degrees of flexion. Unlocking may occur just as\nsuddenly, sometimes following some form of manipulation by the patient.\nThe cause is mechanical: a loose body or torn meniscus has become wedged\nbetween the articular surfaces of the joint. Swelling may occur suddenly\nafter an injury, suggesting it is due to haemarthrosis from a fracture or\nligamentous tear; if swelling occurs after a few hours a torn meniscus is more\nlikely to be the cause. Arthritis and synovitis cause a chronic swelling.\nPatients sometimes notice deformity, which in later life is usually due to\narthritis. Sometimes the patient may complain that the knee is unstable or\ngives way. Patellar instability and ruptured ligaments may present this way.\nOne should always ask about loss of function. There is often a reduced\nability to walk distances, climb stairs and get into and out of chairs.\n",

Fixed lumps in the line of the joint may\nbe meniscal cysts.\nSwelling of the synovium or a knee effusion is usually seen medial to\nthe patella and in the joint’s suprapatellar extension. Loss of the peripatellar\ngrooves may be an early sign of an effusion. Assess fixed flexion deformity\nby squatting down and looking at each knee from the side. A space under the\nknee will be visible if there is permanent flexion deformity arthritis.\nVarus and valgus deformity may be obvious here but are more easily\nseen when the patient stands. Varus deformity is often related to\nosteoarthritis and valgus deformity to rheumatoid arthritis.\nNow watch as the patient flexes and straightens each knee in turn. As\nthe knee extends the patella glides upwards and remains centred over the\nfemoral condyles. If there is patellar subluxation it will slip laterally during\nknee flexion and return to the midline during knee extension.\nFeel the quadriceps for wasting. Palpate over the knees for warmth and\nsynovial swelling.\nTest carefully for a joint effusion. The patellar tap is used to confirm\nthe presence of large effusions (Figure 9.40). One hand rests over the lower\npart of the quadriceps muscle and compresses the suprapatellar extension of\nthe joint space. The other hand pushes the patella downwards. The sign is\npositive if the patella is felt to sink and then comes to rest with a tap as it\ntouches the underlying femur. The bulge sign is used to detect small\neffusions. Here the left hand compresses the suprapatellar pouch while the\nfingers of the right hand are run along the groove beside the patella on one\nside and then the other. A bulging along the groove due to a fluid wave, on\nthe side not being compressed, is a sign of a small effusion.\n",

Flushing of the skin of the face and neck occurs in\nthe carcinoid syndrome (due to the release of vasoactive peptides from the\ntumour). Soft-tissue overgrowth occurs in acromegaly and skin tags may\nappear in the axillae. These are called molluscum fibrinosum.

True primary amenorrhoea may result from ovarian failure (e.g.\nX chromosomal abnormalities such as Turner’s syndrome) or from pituitary\nor hypothalamic disease (e.g. tumour, trauma or idiopathic disease).

      "text": "Pseudotumours of the orbit\n \nThe mechanism of exophthalmos is uncertain. It occurs only in Graves’\ndisease. It may precede the onset of thyrotoxicosis, or may persist after the\npatient has become euthyroid. It is characterised by an inflammatory infiltrate\nof the orbital contents, but not of the globe itself. The orbital muscles are\nparticularly affected, and an increase in their size accounts for most of the\nincreased volume of the orbital contents and therefore for protrusion of the\nglobe. It is probably due to an autoimmune abnormality.\nNext examine for the components of thyroid ophthalmopathy, which are\nrelated to sympathetic overactivity and are not specific for Graves’ disease.\nLook for the thyroid stare (a frightened expression) and lid retraction\n(Dalrymple’s signf), where there is sclera visible above the iris. Test for lid\nlag (von Graefe’s signg) by asking the patient to follow your finger as it\ndescends at a moderate rate from the upper to the lower part of the visual\nfield. Descent of the upper lid lags behind descent of the eyeball.\nIf ptosis is present, one should rule out myasthenia gravis, which can be\nassociated with autoimmune disease.\nThe neck\n \nExamine for thyroid enlargement, which is usually detectable (60%–90% of\npatients). In Graves’ disease the gland is classically diffusely enlarged and is\nsmooth and firm. An associated thrill is usually present but this finding is not\nspecific for thyrotoxicosis caused by Graves’ disease. Absence of thyroid\nenlargement makes Graves’ disease unlikely, but does not exclude it. Possible\nthyroid abnormalities in patients who are thyrotoxic but do not have Graves’\ndisease include a toxic multinodular goitre, a solitary nodule (toxic adenoma),\nand painless, postpartum or subacute (de Quervain’sh) thyroiditis. In de\nQuervain’s thyroiditis there is typically a moderately enlarged firm and tender\ngland. Thyrotoxicosis may occur without any goitre, particularly in elderly\npatients. Alternatively, in hyperthyroidism due to a rare abnormality of\ntrophoblastic tissue (a hydatidiform mole or choriocarcinoma of the testis or\nuterus), or excessive thyroid hormone replacement, the thyroid gland will not\nusually be palpable.\nIf a thyroidectomy scar is present, assess for hypoparathyroidism\n(Chvostek’si or Trousseau’sj signs; page 311).

Causes of vertigo include the ‘peripheral vestibular lesions’:\n• benign positioning (positional) vertigo—recurrent brief episodes of vertigo\nprecipitated by a change of head position, due to crystals in the saccule and\nutricle\n• vestibular neuronitis—non-positional vertigo due to inflammation of the\nacoustic nerve with normal hearing, and\n• acute labyrinthitis—associated with hearing loss.\nOther causes of vertigo include:\n• ototoxic drugs (e.g. aminoglycosides), associated with deafness or\ntinnitus;\n• Ménière’s disease,c which occurs in those over 50 years of age and\npresents with the triad of episodic vertigo and tinnitus (ringing in the ears)\nwith progressive deafness;\n• acoustic neuroma (where patients may also have deafness and tinnitus);\n• central causes such as vertebrobasilar TIAs—these may be associated\nwith diplopia (double vision; page 427), visual loss and ataxia; and\n• rarely, internal auditory artery occlusion.\nVisual disturbances and deafness\n \nProblems with vision can include double vision (diplopia), blurred vision\n(amblyopia), light intolerance (photophobia) and visual loss.

Walking may also be abnormal when orthopaedic\ndisease affects the lower limbs or spine. A bizarrely abnormal gait can\nsometimes be a sign of a hysterical reaction.\nDisturbed sensation or weakness in the limbs\n \nPins and needles in the hands or feet may indicate nerve entrapment or a\nperipheral neuropathy (page 386) but can result from sensory pathway\ninvolvement at any level. The carpal tunnel syndrome is common; here there\nis median nerve entrapment, and patients experience pain and paraesthesiae\nin the hand and wrist. Sometimes pain may extend to the arm and even to the\nshoulder, but paraesthesiae are felt only in the fingers. These symptoms are\nusually worse at night and may be relieved by dangling the arm over the side\nof the bed or shaking the hand.\nNerve root, spinal cord and cerebral abnormalities can all cause\ndisturbance of sensation and weakness.\nLimb weakness can be caused by lesions at different levels in the motor\nsystem. There are a number of patterns of limb and muscle weakness:\n• Upper motor neurone (UMN) weakness (page 383) is due to interruption\nof a neural pathway at a level above the anterior horn cell. The result is an\nincrease in tone and peripheral reflexes. Interruption of this pathway has the\ngreatest effect on the antigravity muscles and is called pyramidal weakness.\nThere is little or no muscle wasting.\n• Lower motor neurone (LMN) weakness (page 385) is due to a lesion that\ninterrupts the reflex arc between the anterior horn cell and the muscle. There\nis a reduction in tone and reflexes, fasciculation (irregular contractions of\nsmall areas of muscle) may be seen and muscle wasting is prominent.\n• Muscle disease causes weakness in a particular muscle or group of\nmuscles. There is wasting, decreased tone, and the reflexes are reduced or\nabsent.\n• Disease at the neuromuscular junction (e.g. myasthenia gravis, page 394)\ncauses generalised weakness, which worsens with repetition. The reflexes\nand tone are often normal.\n• Non-organic weakness (e.g. due to hysteria) causes a non-anatomical\n",

A slow tremor has, by\ndefinition, a rate between 3 Hz and 5 Hz. Rapid tremors are faster than 10\nHz. Resting tremors are present mostly during relaxation of the muscles,\nwhile intention tremors occur with deliberate movement and become more\npronounced towards the end of the action. Tremors become worse with\nfatigue or anxiety. Shivering is a type of tremor brought on by cold. It is\nnormal for there to be a fine tremor associated with holding a posture or\nperforming a movement slowly. This is called a physiological tremor. It\nbecomes more obvious with fright and fatigue. It is often increased by the\nbeta-agonist drugs used to treat asthma or by caffeine. Thyrotoxicosis is a\ncause of exaggeration of physiological tremor. These movements are very\nfine and may be difficult to see unless looked for specifically. Benign\nessential (familial) tremor is an inherited disorder which causes tremor, but\nno other signs. The tremor is most easily seen when the patient’s arms are\nstretched out; it can become worse during voluntary movements. It usually\ndisappears when the muscles are at complete rest. Parkinson’s diseased may\npresent with a resting tremor (page 397). Intention (or target-seeking) tremor\nis due to cerebellar disease (page 398) .

The chin is brought up to approach the chest wall. Meningism may\nbe caused by pyogenic or other infection of the meninges, or by blood in the\nsubarachnoid space secondary to subarachnoid haemorrhage. There is\nresistance to neck flexion due to painful spasm of the extensor muscles of the\nneck. Other causes of resistance to neck flexion are characterised by an equal\nresistance to head rotation. They include: (i) cervical spondylosis; (ii) after\ncervical fusion; (iii) Parkinson’s disease; and (iv) raised intracranial pressure,\nespecially if there is impending tonsillar herniation. The Brudzinski signe is\nspontaneous flexion of the hips during flexion of the neck by the examiner\nand indicates meningism.\nKernig’s signf should also be elicited if meningitis is suspected. Flex\neach hip in turn, then attempt to straighten the knee while keeping the hip\nflexed.

Sudden loss of vision in one\neye (often described as the awareness of a curtain being drawn across the\neye) may be due to an embolus to the retina. These are called negative visual\nsymptoms. There is usually, but not always, spontaneous return of vision.\nThis is called amaurosis fugax.

The following patterns of visual field\nloss may be detected (Figures 11.6 and 11.7):\n• Concentric diminution of the field (tunnel vision) may be caused by\nglaucoma; retinal abnormalities such as chorioretinitis or retinitis pigmentosa;\npapilloedema; or acute ischaemia, as with migraine. Normally even a reduced\nfield of vision widens as objects are moved further away. Tubular diminution\nof the visual fields suggests hysteria. There is always a small area close to the\ncentre of the visual fields where there is no vision (the blind spot). This is the\narea where the optic disc is seen on fundoscopy and is the point where the\noptic nerve joins the retina. The blind spot enlarges with papilloedema.\n• Central scotomata, or loss of central (macular) vision, may be due to\ndemyelination of the optic nerve (multiple sclerosis causes unilateral or\nasymmetrical bilateral scotomata); toxic causes, such as methyl alcohol\n(symmetrical bilateral scotomata); nutritional causes, such as tobacco or\nalcohol amblyopia (symmetrical central or centrocecal scotomata); vascular\nlesions (unilateral); and gliomas of the optic nerve (unilateral).\n• Total unilateral visual loss is due to a lesion of the optic nerve or to\nunilateral eye disease.\n• Bitemporal hemianopia is due to a lesion that affects the centre of the\noptic chiasm, damaging fibres from the nasal halves of the retinas as they\ndecussate. This will result in loss of both temporal halves of the visual fields.\nCauses include a pituitary tumour, a craniopharyngioma and a suprasellar\nmeningioma.\n• Binasal hemianopia is very rare and is due to bilateral lesions affecting\nthe uncrossed optic fibres, such as atheroma of the internal carotid siphon.\n• Homonymous hemianopia is due to a lesion that damages the optic tract\nor radiation, affecting the visual field on the right or left side. For example,\nleft temporal and right nasal field loss will occur with a right-sided lesion. The\nexact nature of the defect depends on the site of interruption of the fibres. In\nthe optic tract the defect is usually complete—there is no macular sparing. In\nthe more posterior optic radiation the macular vision is usually spared if the\ncause is ischaemia, but not if a destructive process such as tumour or\nhaemorrhage is responsible.

There is normally\nconstriction of both pupils—the accommodation response. It depends on a\npathway from the visual association cortex descending to the third nerve\nnucleus. Causes of an absent light reflex with an intact accommodation reflex\ninclude a midbrain lesion (e.g. the Argyll Robertson pupil of syphilis), a\nciliary ganglion lesion (e.g. Adie’s pupilo) or Parinaud’s syndromep (page\n340). Failure of accommodation alone may occur occasionally with a\nmidbrain lesion or with cortical blindness.\nEye movements\n \nHere failure of eye movement, double vision (diplopia) and nystagmus are\nassessed.\nNormally the eyes move in parallel except during convergence. When\nthey move out of alignment the patient is said to have strabismus or a squint.\nThis abnormality may be due to a cranial nerve palsy (III, IV or VI), and in\nthese cases the angle of alignment changes depending on the direction of gaze\n( a n incomitant squint). When the malalignment of the eye movement\nremains constant for any direction of gaze the squint is said to be\nconcomitant. Concomitant squints are common in children and may be\nidiopathic or occasionally caused by an intracranial mass.

Therefore test for nystagmus by asking the patient to follow\nyour pin out to 30 degrees from the central gaze position.\nNystagmus may be jerky or pendular.\nJerky horizontal nystagmus may be due to (i) a vestibular lesion\n(acute lesions cause nystagmus away from the side of the lesion while\nchronic lesions cause nystagmus to the side of the lesion); (ii) a cerebellar\nlesion (unilateral diseases cause nystagmus to the side of the lesion); (iii) toxic\ncauses, such as phenytoin and alcohol (may also cause vertical nystagmus\nbut less often); and (iv) internuclear ophthalmoplegia. Internuclear\nophthalmoplegia is present when there is nystagmus in the abducting eye and\nfailure of adduction of the other (affected) side.

This condition is thought to occur as a result of poor vision or\nincreased sensitivity to light. It develops in childhood and occurs as the\npatient performs searching movements in an attempt to fixate or improve the\nvisual impulses.\nA summary of how to approach the medical eye examination is provided\non in Chapter 13.\nThe fifth (trigeminal) nerve\n \nExamination anatomy\n \nThis nerve contains both sensory and motor fibres.

Rotation of the wrists with\nsupination and pronation of the elbow joints (supporting the patient’s elbow\nwith one hand and holding the hand with the other) is performed passively,\nand the patient should be told to relax to allow the examiner to move the\njoints freely.\nIf the patient resists these movements the joints should be moved\nunpredictably and at different rates. When the arm is raised by the examiner\nand dropped, it will fall suddenly if tone is reduced. With experience it is\npossible to decide if tone is normal or increased (hypertonic, as in an upper\nmotor neurone or extrapyramidal lesion). Hypotonia is a difficult clinical sign\nto elicit and probably not helpful in the assessment of a lower motor neurone\nlesion.\nThe cogwheel rigidity of Parkinson’s disease is an important\nabnormality of tone in the upper limbs and should be recognised. It is best\nassessed by having the patient move the other arm up and down as the\nexaminer moves the hand and forearm, testing tone at the wrist and elbow.\nMyotonia as described above is also an abnormality of tone that is\nworse after active movement. In these patients, tone is usually normal at rest\nbut after sudden movements there may be a great increase in tone and the\npatient is unable to relax the muscle.

Los Altos: Lange Medical,\n1985.\n \nPatients with brachial plexus lesions may complain of pain or weakness\nin the shoulders or arms. Pain is often prominent, especially when there has\nbeen nerve root avulsion. A neurological cause is more likely if there is dull\npain that is difficult to localise, if the pain is not related to limb movement\nand is worse at night, and if there is no associated tenderness. The patient\nmay be unable to get comfortable. An orthopaedic or traumatic cause is more\nlikely if the pain is much worse with movement, or there are signs of\ninflammation, joint deformity or local tenderness. Most plexus lesions are\nsupraclavicular (i.e. proximal), especially when they occur after trauma.\nWhen infraclavicular (i.e. distal) lesions occur they are usually less severe.\nExamine the arms and shoulder girdle (Table 11.15). Remember that the\ndorsal scapular nerve (which supplies the rhomboid muscles) comes from the\nC5 nerve root proximal to the upper trunk, and so rhomboid function is\nusually spared in upper trunk lesions. Typical lesions of the brachial plexus\nare described in Table 11.16. The cervical rib syndrome may cause a lower\nbrachial plexus lesion (Table 11.17) .

Then run a hand along each shin, feeling for\nwasting of the anterior tibial muscles.\nTone\n \nTest tone at the knees and ankles. Place one hand under a chosen knee and\nthen abruptly pull the knee upwards, causing flexion. When the patient is\nrelaxed this should occur without resistance. Then, supporting the thigh, flex\nand extend the knee at increasing velocity, feeling for resistance to muscle\nstretch (tone). Tone in the legs may also be tested by sitting the patient with\nlegs hanging freely over the edge of the bed. A leg (of the patient) is raised by\nthe examiner to the horizontal and suddenly let go. The leg will oscillate up to\nhalf a dozen times in a normal person who is completely relaxed. If\nhypotonia is present, as occurs in cerebellar disease, the oscillations will be\nwider and more prolonged. If increased tone or spasticity is present, the\nmovements will be irregular and jerky.\nNext test for clonus of the ankle and knee. This is a sustained\nrhythmical contraction of the muscles when put under sudden stretch. It is\ndue to hypertonia from an upper motor neurone lesion. It represents an\nincrease in reflex excitability (from increased alpha motor neurone activity).\nSharply dorsiflex the foot with the knee bent and the thigh externally\nrotated. When ankle clonus is present, recurrent ankle plantar flexion\nmovement occurs. This may persist for as long as the examiner sustains\ndorsiflexion of the ankle. Test for patellar clonus (which is not so common)\nby resting the hand on the lower part of the quadriceps with the knee\nextended and moving the patella down sharply. Sustained rhythmical\ncontraction of the quadriceps occurs as long as the downward stretch is\nmaintained.\n",

This may involve testing over\nthe abdominal or even the chest dermatomes. Establishing a sensory level on\nthe trunk indicates the spinal cord level that is affected. Remember, a level of\nhyperaesthesia (increased sensitivity) often occurs above the sensory level\nand it is the upper level of this that should be determined, as it usually\nindicates the highest affected spinal segment. Also remember that the level of\na vertebral body only corresponds to the spinal cord level in the upper\ncervical cord because the spinal cord is shorter than the spinal canal. The C8\nspinal segment lies opposite the C7 vertebra. In the upper thoracic cord there\nis a difference of about two segments and in the mid-thoracic cord three\nsegments. All the lumbosacral segments are opposite the T11 to L1\nvertebrae.\nThe superficial or cutaneous reflexes\n \nThese reflexes occur in response to light touch or scratching of the skin or\nmucous membranes. The stimulus is more superficial than the tendon\n(muscle stretch) reflexes. As a rule these reflexes occur more slowly after the\nstimulus, are less constantly present and fatigue more easily.\nExamples include the palmar or grasp reflex, the cremasteric reflex and\nthe abdominal reflexes and the plantar responses.\nThe abdominal reflexes (epigastric T6–T9, mid-abdominal T9–T11,\nlower abdominal T11–L1)\n \nTest these by lightly stroking the abdominal wall diagonally towards the\numbilicus in each of the four quadrants of the abdomen (Figure 11.84).\nReflex contractions of the abdominal wall are absent in upper motor neurone\nlesions above the segmental level and also in patients who have had surgical\noperations interrupting the nerves.

Certain types of speech may be retained by these patients.\nThese include automatic speech. The patient may be able to recite word\nseries such as the days of the week or letters of the alphabet. Sometimes\nemotional speech may be preserved so that when frustrated or upset the\npatient may be able to swear fluently. In the same way the patient may be\nable to sing familiar songs while unable to speak the words. It is important to\nremember that unless the lesion responsible for these defects is very large\nthere may be no reduction in the patient’s higher intellectual functions,\nmemory or judgment. Some of these patients may incorrectly be considered\npsychotic, because of their disorganised speech.\n3. Nominal dysphasia. All types of dysphasia cause difficulty naming\nobjects. There is also a specific type of nominal dysphasia. Here objects\ncannot be named (e.g. the nib of a pen) but other aspects of speech are\nnormal. The patient may use long sentences to overcome failure to find the\ncorrect word (circumlocution). It occurs with a lesion of the dominant\nposterior temporoparietal area. Other causes include encephalopathy or the\nintracranial pressure effects of a distinct space-occupying lesion; it may also\noccur in the recovery phase from any dysphasia. Its localising value is\ntherefore doubtful.\n4. Conductive dysphasia. Here patients repeat statements and name\nobjects poorly, but can follow commands. This is thought to be caused by a\nlesion of the arcuate fasciculus and/or other fibres linking Wernicke’s and\nBroca’s areas.\nTo examine for dysphasia in more detail refer to Table 11.21. If the\nspeech is fluent, but conveys information with paraphasic errors, such as\n‘treen’ for ‘train’ (i.e. a word of similar sound or spelling to the one intended\nis used),tt the main possibilities are nominal, receptive and conductive\ndysphasia. Test for these by asking the patient to name an object, repeat a\nstatement after you, and then follow commands. Then, if the above are\nabnormal, ask the patient to read and write, but remember that the occasional\npatient may be illiterate.\nIf the speech is slow, hesitant and non-fluent, expressive dysphasia is\nmore likely and exactly the same procedure is followed. It is important to\nnote that many dysphasias will have mixed elements.

A parietal lobe lesion results in astereognosis on\nthe opposite side.\n• Agraphesthesia may also be present; this is the inability to appreciate a\nnumber drawn on the hand on the opposite side to a parietal lesion (Figure\n11.91).\n",

Walking heel-to-toe will be difficult.\nTesting for propulsion or retropulsion (propulsion involves pushing the\npatient from behind and retropulsion pushing from in front) is of uncertain\nvalue and must be done with some caution because the patient may be\nunable to stop and may fall over. The examiner can stand behind the patient\nand pull him or her backwards, but should stand braced to catch the patient.\nBradykinesia (a decrease in the speed and amplitude of complex\nmovements) may be the result of a lesion in the nigrostriatal pathway (a\ndopaminergic pathway), which affects connections between the caudate\nnucleus, putamen and motor cortex, causing abnormal movement\nprogramming and abnormal recruitment of single motor units. Two simple\ntests (Figure 11.109) for this are finger tapping and twiddling. Ask the\npatient to tap the fingers in turn onto a surface repeatedly, quickly and with\nboth hands at once. Twiddling is rotating the hands around each other in\nfront of the body. These movements are slow and clumsy in Parkinsonian\npatients but obviously depend on motor and cerebellar function as well.\nDifficulty getting out of a chair can be another sign of bradykinesia and\npatients often have difficulty turning over in bed.\nFigure 11.109 Detecting bradykinesia\n(a) Tapping the fingers.

These may be unilateral or generalised.\nOften the patient attempts to disguise this by completing the involuntary\nmovements with a voluntary one. In this disease, dopaminergic pathways\ndominate over cholinergic transmissions.\nChorea can usefully be distinguished from hemiballismus, athetosis and\npseudoathetosis. Hemiballismus is due to a subthalamic lesion on the side\nopposite the movement disorder. It causes unilateral wild throwing\nmovements of the proximal joints. There may be skin excoriation due to limb\ntrauma. These movements may persist during sleep. Athetosis or dystonia is\ndue to a lesion of the outer segment of the putamen and causes slow sinuous\nwrithing distal movements that are present at rest. Pseudoathetosis is a\ndescription given to athetoid movements in the fingers in patients with severe\nproprioceptive loss (these are especially prominent when the eyes are shut).\nIf the patient has chorea, proceed as follows. First shake hands. There\nmay be tremor and dystonia superimposed on lack of sustained hand grip\n(‘milkmaid’s grip’). Ask the patient to hold out the hands, then look for a\nchoreic (dystonic) posture. This typically involves finger and thumb\nhyperextension and wrist flexion.\nGo to the face and look at the eyes for exophthalmos (thyrotoxicosis),\nKayser-Fleischer rings (Wilson’s disease) and conjunctival injection\n(polycythaemia). Ask the patient to poke out the tongue and note frequent\nretraction of the tongue (serpentine movements). Look for skin rashes (e.g.\nsystemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis).

The practising clinician must have an understanding of\npsychiatric illness and know how to perform a psychiatric interview and a\nmental state examination. This is because there is considerable overlap\nbetween psychiatric and physical illness.\nPsychiatric disorders (especially anxiety and depression) are common,\nand people suffering from these conditions often have medical problems.\nAppropriate management of these patients will require an understanding of\nthe intercurrent psychiatric disorder and the effect of that disorder on the\nprimary medical problem. A medical illness may, in some instances, present\nas a psychiatric illness. For example, some endocrine disorders, such as\nmyxoedema, may present with depression. On the other hand, some\npsychiatric disorders may present medically. Panic disorder (or acute anxiety)\nmay be mistaken for an acute myocardial infarction. Furthermore, a patient’s\npsychological state may interfere with the course of a medical illness; it may\nlead in some cases to exaggeration of the symptoms and in others to denial of\nthe severity of physical symptoms.\nThe psychiatric history generally follows the same format as the\nstandard medical history, and the principles described in Chapters 1 and 2\napply just as much here as in any history taking.1 One should inquire about\nthe history of the present illness, the past psychiatric and medical history, and\nthe social and family history. However, the psychiatric history aims to elicit\nmore detail about the patient’s illness from a broad perspective, focusing not\nonly on symptoms but also on the patient’s social background, psychological\n",

There is,\ntherefore, more attention paid to the developmental, personal and social\nhistory than is normal for a standard medical history.\nThe method of psychiatric history taking is somewhat different from the\nstandard medical interview. The psychiatric interview aims to be therapeutic\nas well as diagnostic. In the course of the interview it is hoped that the patient\nwill be able to talk about his or her problems and their context. In doing so,\npatients will gain some relief from their distress by airing their problems. For\nthis to take place, the clinician’s attitude needs to be unhurried, patient and\nunderstanding. The psychiatric history also aims to gain an understanding of\nhow the patient’s problem arose from a biological, interpersonal, social and\npsychological perspective, so that the best management plan can be worked\nout.\nObtaining the history\n \nThe clinician taking a psychiatric history wants the patient to tell his or her\nstory in his or her own words. In this way the patient will be more likely to\nreport the most important aspects of the illness. This is best achieved using a\nnon-directive approach with open-ended questions. Open-ended questions\nare those to which the patient will respond with narrative (or a description\nabout what has been happening) rather than a simple factual response. They\ngive the patient an opportunity to talk about his or her problems. Closed\nquestions are more likely to elicit ‘yes’ or ‘no’ responses. For example, in the\nassessment of a patient with depression, a closed question would be: ‘Have\nyou been depressed?’ An open-ended question would be: ‘Tell me about how\nyou have been feeling.’ At first glance it might appear that the open-ended\nquestion is less efficient, as it could take a longer time to find out about a\nrange of symptoms. However, with a careful and judicious approach, open-\nended questioning—by permitting the patient to tell the story—will enable the\nclinician to get a comprehensive history efficiently. This is not to say that\ntargeted, more-closed questions must not be used—they are necessary to\nelicit certain symptoms.\nWhile the patient is telling his or her story, the clinician should begin\nto formulate hypotheses about the problem or diagnosis. These hypotheses\nare tested by asking more-focused questions later in the interview, at which\npoint a diagnostic hypothesis can be rejected or pursued further. For\nexample, a patient may describe tiredness and lethargy, an inability to\nconcentrate and loss of appetite. These symptoms will suggest a diagnosis of\ndepression. Follow-up questions should focus on this possibility. The clinician\nshould ask questions about other symptoms of depression such as: ‘How\nhave you been feeling in yourself?’ ‘What has your mood been like?’ and\n",

The problem\n \nFind out the nature of the patient’s problem, and the patient’s perception of\nhis or her difficulties. This can, of course, be difficult if the patient is\npsychotic and does not believe a problem exists at all. In these cases a\ncorroborative history must be taken. For example, a manic patient may\nconsider that there is nothing wrong and that his or her behaviour is\nreasonable, whereas his or her partner is able to recognise that ordering an\nexpensive new sports car when the family is impoverished is a problem.\nA range of symptoms commonly found in psychiatric disorders needs to\nbe reviewed in the course of assessing the history of the present illness.\nThese include mood change, anxiety, worry, sleep pattern, appetite,\nhallucinations and delusions. A set of simple screening questions for each of\nthe major diagnoses is listed within Table 12.1. It is especially useful to ask\nabout symptoms of anxiety and depression (the most common psychiatric\ndisorders). The definitions of other symptoms are given in Table 12.2. It is\nimportant to ask about drug usage (legal and illegal) as well as alcohol and\ncaffeine (which may be associated with anxiety disorders).\nTABLE 12.1 The common psychiatric disorders* and their screening questions\n \n \n \n \n \n",

He or she\nshould also be asked if anyone in the family has had any treatment for\npsychological problems, such as anxiety, depression, agoraphobia,a eating\ndisorders or drug and alcohol problems (these last few areas are often not\nconsidered by patients to be psychiatric or mental illnesses).\nSecond, one should try to determine what sort of family the patient\ngrew up in. Drawing up a family tree is a useful way of finding this out.\nFactual details about each family member can be included in this family tree\n(age, mental state, health). In the psychiatric history we also need to know\nabout what type of person each family member is, and how family members\nget on with each other. It is worth exploring how much care (or neglect) the\npatient received from each parent, and how controlling or protective each\nwas.

During the course of this\nnarrative, the patient may require some prompting to add information about\nimportant issues such as the birth history (schizophrenia is known to be\nassociated with perinatal morbidity) and early development, and whether\nthere were significant problems in early childhood, such as head injuries or\nserious infections. How did the patient cope with early separations,\nparticularly when starting primary school and going on to secondary school\n(difficulty in separation may be a risk factor for panic disorder or abnormal\nillness behaviour).

The patient’s problem needs to be understood longitudinally, by\ndefining biophysical factors that may have predisposed to the illness and,\nmore immediately, may have precipitated the illness, and factors that may be\ncontributing to the person remaining ill (perpetuating factors). A simple grid\ncan be used for assessing the patient in this manner (Table 12.10). Here\nbiological, psychological or psychosocial factors that predispose to,\nprecipitate or perpetuate the psychiatric illness are identified. Perpetuating\nfactors are very important, particularly among medically ill patients, as it may\nbe the medical or physical illness that maintains the patient’s psychiatric\nproblem.

If there is actual protrusion of the eyes from the\norbits, this is called proptosis. It is best detected by looking at the eyes from\nabove the forehead; protrusion beyond the supraorbital ridge is abnormal. If\nexophthalmos is present, examine specifically for thyroid eye disease: lid lag\n(the patient follows the examiner’s finger as it descends—the upper lid lags\nbehind the pupil), chemosis (oedema of the bulbar conjunctiva), corneal\nulceration and ophthalmoplegia (weakness of upward gaze). Look then for\nany corneal abnormalities, such as band keratopathy or arcus senilis.\n3. Look for corneal ulceration which may be obvious if severe. A drop of\nsterile fluorescein will stain corneal ulcers.\n4. Proceed then as for the cranial nerve examination—that is, testing\nvisual acuity, visual fields and pupillary responses to light and\naccommodation. Interruption of the sympathetic innervation of the eye at any\npoint results in Horner’s syndrome (partial ptosis and a constricted but\nreactive pupil). Perceptible anisocoria (inequality of the diameters of the\npupils) has been found in 20% of normal people. Remember also that elderly\npeople quite often have imperceptible pupillary light reactions.\n5. Test the eye movements (Figure 13.4). Look also for fatiguability of\neye muscles by asking the patient to look up at a hat-pin or finger for about\nhalf a minute. In myasthenia gravis the muscles tire and the eyelids begin to\ndroop.\n6. Test colour vision if acuity is not poor. Ishihara test plates (where\ncoloured spots form numbers) can be used. Red desaturation (impaired\nability to see red objects) can occur with optic nerve disease. Red-green\ncolour blindness affects 7% of males (X-linked recessive).\n7. Test the corneal reflex. Consider the possibility that the patient may\nhave a glass eye. This should be suspected if visual acuity is zero in one eye\nand no pupillary reaction is apparent. Attempts to examine and interpret the\nfundus of a glass eye will amuse the patient but are always unsuccessful.\n8. Perform fundoscopy. Successful ophthalmoscopy requires considerable\npractice. It is important that it be performed in reduced ambient lighting so\nthat the patient’s pupils are at least partly dilated and the examiner is not\ndistracted.

This presents with sudden, painless\nunilateral blindness, and is a medical emergency.\nCentral retinal vein thrombosis causes tortuous retinal veins and\nhaemorrhages scattered over the whole retina, particularly occurring\nalongside the veins (‘blood and thunder retina’). This presents with sudden\npainless loss of vision which is not total.\nRetinitis pigmentosa causes a scattering of black pigment in a criss-\ncross pattern. This will be missed if the periphery of the retina is not\nexamined.\nIn retinal detachment, the retina may appear elevated or folded. The\npatient describes a ‘shade coming down’, flashes of light or showers of black\ndots. A diagnosis requires immediate referral to try to prevent total\ndetachment and irrevocable blindness.\nWhite spots occur in choroiditis which when active have a fluffy edge\n(e.g. in toxoplasmosis, sarcoidosis).\nFinally, ask the patient to look directly at the light. This allows the\nexaminer to locate and inspect the macula. Macular degeneration is the\nleading cause of blindness; central vision is lost. Drussen formation occurs in\nmacular degeneration—small deposits are seen under the epithelium in the\ncentral retina. Macular degeneration may occur secondary to an atrophic or\nneovascularisation process.\n9. Palpate the orbits for tenderness.

This examination is essential if there is a history of\nrecent deafness or a painful ear. Examination is also necessary in the patient\nwho has had a head injury. Always examine both ears!\nFigure 13.10 Use of the auriscope\n \nThe correct technique is as follows. Ask the patient to turn his or her\nhead slightly to the side, then pull the pinna up, out and back to straighten the\near canal and provide optimal vision. Stretch out the fingers of the hand\nholding the auriscope to touch the patient’s cheek, to steady the instrument\nand prevent sudden movements of the patient’s head. When examining the\npatient’s right ear, the auriscope is preferably held in a downward position\nwith the right hand, while using the left hand to pull the pinna.

All medications that have been taken must be documented.\nOrally ingested or parenteral medications can cause a whole host of\ncutaneous lesions and can mimic many skin diseases (Table 15.1). Similarly,\na family history of atopic dermatitis, hay fever or skin infestation can be\nhelpful.\nTABLE 15.1 Types of cutaneous drug reactions\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

Neurofibromas are smaller than\nlipomas. They look hard but are remarkably soft; they occur in\nneurofibromatosis Type 1 (von Recklinghausen’sb disease).

With each\nmajor sign the groups of common important diseases that should be\nconsidered will be listed.\nPruritus\n \nPruritus simply means itching. It may be either generalised or localised.\nScratch marks are usually present. Localised pruritus is usually caused by a\ndermatological condition such as dermatitis or eczema. Generalised pruritus\nmay be caused by primary skin disease, systemic disease or psychogenic\nfactors.\nTo determine the cause of the pruritus it is essential to examine the skin\nin detail (Table 15.4). Excoriations are caused by scratching, regardless of the\nunderlying cause.

This is\nexcellent training for clinical practice, as the need to discuss patients with\ncolleagues or specialists arises frequently in both hospital and non-hospital\npractice.\nA successful case presentation is both succinct and relevant. The\nexaminer is most interested in what the patient’s problems are now. One\nshould aim to convey basic biographical information and an assessment of\nthe patient’s presenting problem in the first few sentences. It is often helpful\nto present the case as a diagnostic or management problem, or both.\nThe information will have been obtained from the patient by taking the\nhistory as set out above. The examination of the patient should be performed\nwith particular attention to the areas most likely to be abnormal. This\ninformation must then be assembled into a form that can easily be conveyed\nto others. The following is a suggested method.\n1. Begin with a sentence that tells your colleague something about the patient and the clinical\nproblem. For example, one might say ‘Mr Jones is a 72-year-old retired cabinet minister\nwho presents with two hours of chest pain which is not typically ischaemic’. This gives an\nidea about the patient himself and indicates that the problem is likely to be a diagnostic one.\n2. One should then go on to explain in what way the pain is atypical of ischaemia and\nwhether it has features suggestive of any other diagnosis.\n3. Once the presenting symptom or problem has been described, relevant past history should\nbe discussed. In a patient with chest pain this would include any previous cardiac history or\ninvestigations, and a summary of the patient’s risk factors for ischaemic heart disease.\n4. Present a list of the patient’s current medications.\n5. Important previous health problems should be outlined briefly. This retired cabinet minister\nmight also have a history of intermittent claudication and of chronic obstructive pulmonary\ndisease. These facts will affect possible treatment for ischaemic heart disease, e.g. the use of\nbeta-blockers.\n6. Present the physical examination in two parts.\n(a) Abnormal and important normal examination findings in the presenting system. In\nthis patient’s case this would mean giving the pulse rate and blood pressure but not\ndetails of normal heart sounds. If there was a history of claudication, the examination of\nthe peripheral pulses should be presented even if it is normal.\n(b) Abnormal findings in the rest of the examination.\n7. Offer the most likely diagnosis and the differential diagnosis.\n8 Suggest a planfor investigationand treatment\n",

An important guide to the areas where examination should be\nparticularly directed, apart from the history, is the general inspection. A\nminute or two spent standing back to inspect the patient before the detailed\nexamination begins is never wasted.\nAppendix III\nThe pre-anaesthetic medical evaluation (PAME)\n \nAn appropriate medical evaluation of the patient who has been admitted\nfor elective surgery is always required. It includes a history and examination\nwhich is sufficient to uncover any likely major problems with anaesthesia or\nthe procedure itself.\nThe history\n \nThe first thing to find out, of course, is the presenting problem, what\noperation is intended, and whether the surgery is expected to be performed\nunder general or local anaesthesia. Clearly the assessment of a patient having\na small lesion removed under local anaesthesia can be briefer than the\nassessment of a patient undergoing extensive bowel resection under general\nanaesthesia. As a rule, before any patient undergoes surgery under general\nanaesthesia or spinal anaesthesia, careful attention must be given to\nidentifying whether he or she is at higher risk.\nCardiovascular history\n \nThe most important questions here relate to a history of ischaemic heart\ndisease.

A history of stable angina which has not changed for\nmonths or years is not a contraindication to most forms of surgery. The\nrecent placement of a coronary stent may mean that cessation of anti-platelet\ndrugs is not safe for 1 month after insertion of a bare metal stent and 1 year\nafter the insertion of a drug-eluting stent.\nSymptoms of cardiac failure should be sought. Any patient with\nuncontrolled cardiac failure is at considerable risk of severe cardiac failure\npostoperatively. This is particularly true if large amounts of intravenous fluids\nare given during and after surgery while the patient’s anti-failure drugs (e.g.\ndiuretics) are omitted.\nCardiac drugs should be asked about, particularly anti-anginal and anti-\nfailure drugs. It is important to attempt to ensure that the patient receives\nthese drugs, particularly beta-blockers, on the day of the operation. The\nsurgeon will often require the patient to stop aspirin a week or more before\nsurgery. This is usually a safe thing for the patient to do but may be a\nproblem in the first month at least after a coronary angioplasty because of the\nrisk of thrombosis of the stent in this early period. Previous coronary artery\nbypass grafting or angioplasty is not a contraindication to surgery.\nA history of infective endocarditis or the presence of a prosthetic cardiac\nvalve or complex congenital cardiac condition is an indication for antibiotic\nprophylaxis for any procedure that may result in bacteraemia – the circulation\nof bacteria in the blood stream. These procedures include most types of\ndental work, colonoscopy and surgery on the bowel or bladder, and some\ngynaecological operations and vaginal delivery.\nPatients who take the anticoagulant drug warfarin are a special problem.\nWhen the drug is being used to protect the patient from embolic events\nassociated with atrial fibrillation it may be reasonable, on the balance of risks,\nto have the drug stopped 4 days before surgery and resumed as soon as\npractical afterwards. If the patient takes the drug to protect a mechanical\nheart valve from clot, the drug should, in general, be replaced by intravenous\nunfractionated or subcutaneous fractionated heparin. The last dose of\nfractionated heparin can be given about 12 hours before surgery and the drug\nrecommenced as soon as the surgeon feels it is safe. Many patients can\nadminister the drug themselves at home. Patients with mechanical valves,\nespecially in the mitral position, are at high risk of embolic events if their\nwarfarin is stopped without replacement with some form of heparin.\nThe presence of a cardiac pacemaker or implanted defibrillator may be a\nproblem if the surgeon intends to use a diathermy device.\nThe respiratory history\n",

Patients who have continued to smoke\nup to the time of their surgery have a much higher risk of postoperative chest\ninfections than those who have not. Even stopping a few weeks before will\nreduce this risk. Severe respiratory disease is a relative contraindication to\nsurgery. It may be difficult to reverse the anaesthetic and muscle relaxant\ndrugs in such a patient, and he or she may require ventilation postoperatively.\nDoctors in charge of intensive care units are always happier to be warned\nthat a patient may require ventilation postoperatively than to have it come as\na surprise.\nDrug therapy for respiratory disease must be asked about. Steroids may\nimpair wound healing, and steroid doses may need to be increased during the\noperative period because of steroid-induced adrenal suppression.\nOther\n \nInquire about any history of bleeding diathesis, diabetes mellitus, renal\ndisease, hepatitis, jaundice and drug abuse. The control of blood sugar in\ndiabetic patients can be difficult in the perioperative period, especially while\nnormal diet is impossible. The fasting preoperative diabetic on insulin may\nneed to be advised to have half the normal insulin dose on the morning of\nsurgery, possibly with a very early light breakfast. This may be important to\navoid ketoacidosis.\nSpecific \ninquiries \nabout previous operations and anaesthetics,\nparticularly with reference to any complications, should be made. Allergies\nto anaesthetic agents or other drugs must be asked about. Attempt to\ndistinguish a true allergy or anaphylaxis from an adverse effect such as\nvomiting after a morphine injection. Some operations involve the use of\ncontrast media, and an allergy to iodine may be a contraindication to their\nuse. This risk is now much less with the new non-ionic contrast media.
