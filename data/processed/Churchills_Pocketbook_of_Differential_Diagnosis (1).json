We are pleased that Andrew Ostor, Consultant \nRheumatologist at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, has agreed \nto fill this role. It is now eight years since the first edition and four \nyears since the second and in that time Eric Lim has progressed from \nSenior House Officer on the first edition, to Registrar on the second \nand is now a Consultant Thoracic Surgeon. Much has changed in that \ntime and most of the chapters have been updated. New chapters on \nhalitosis, hallucinations, nail abnormalities, rashes, thirst, tiredness \nand vaginal discharge have been added. We have also attempted to \nindicate the relative frequency of the various conditions by colour \ncoding them according to whether they are considered common \n(green), occasional (orange) or rare (red).\nWe have also added new sections on biochemistry (Section B) \nand haematology (Section C). These list the causes of such things \nas hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia, leucocytosis and anaemia and \nhave been written in a slightly different style from the main \nclinical section. They provide a ready check for assessing abnormal \nbiochemical and haematological results.\nWe have welcomed comments from teachers and students who \nhave suggested additions and corrections and these have been taken \ninto account when writing this third edition. We are pleased with the \nway that the first and second editions have sold and that, in these \ndays of self-directed problem-based learning, medical students still \nsee the need for a book offering a didactic approach.\nWhen we originally wrote the first edition of this book, we hoped \nit would fit into the ‘white coat pocket’ and be useful on the wards. \nNow with the ‘bare below the elbow’ edict, we hope that you \nwill have large enough pockets in the new dress code-compliant \nuniforms to accommodate it! We hope it will continue to help you \non the wards and in the clinics – and in examinations.\nA.T.R.  Sheffield\nE.L.  London\nA.J.K.O.  Cambridge\nSUBASH KC/NMC-15TH/2014\n",

It is appreciated that some conditions may be common in \nthe UK and rare in other parts of the world (and vice versa). Where \nthis is the case, the appropriate colour coding is indicated in brackets, \ne.g. Campylobacter is a common cause of diarrhoea in the UK and \ntherefore coded green but rare in tropical Africa and therefore \ncoded red and in brackets. We have tried to indicate the importance \nof the condition, not only in causing a particular symptom or sign, \nbut also in its overall incidence, e.g. diverticular disease is a common \ncondition and is a common cause of pain in the left iliac fossa and is \ntherefore coded green. It is only an occasional cause of large bowel \nobstruction and in this context is coded orange.\nAt the end of each chapter the reader will find a box containing \neither what we consider to be important learning points, or \nindicating symptoms and signs suggestive of significant pathology \nwhich require urgent action.\nSUBASH KC/NMC-15TH/2014\n",

A spigelian hernia occurs just lateral \nto the rectus muscle, halfway between the umbilicus and symphysis \npubis. It is usually reducible.\nLarge bowel\nA short history of central abdominal, colicky pain followed by a \nsharply localised pain in the right iliac fossa will suggest the diagnosis \nof acute appendicitis. After 48 hours, if there is not generalised \nperitonitis, an appendix mass will have formed and an abscess may \nsubsequently form in the right iliac fossa. With carcinoma of the \ncaecum the patient will either have noticed a mass or will present \nwith alteration in bowel habit and the symptoms of anaemia, e.g. \ntiredness, lethargy. The same applies to carcinoma of the ascending \ncolon. Faeces will be indentable and hard, rock-like masses will be felt \naround the colon. Caecal volvulus will present with central abdominal \ncolicky pain and abdominal distension. Intussusception is more \ncommon in infants and usually presents with colicky abdominal pain \nand the classic ‘redcurrant jelly’ stool. Crohn’s disease will present \nwith malaise and diarrhoea with central abdominal colicky pain.\nCarcinoma of the sigmoid colon will present with lower abdominal \ncolicky pain, a change in bowel habit and bleeding PR. Diverticular \ndisease may present with similar symptoms. Sigmoid volvulus will \npresent with lower abdominal colicky pain and a tense, palpable \nmass in the left abdomen, which is tympanitic on percussion. Large \nbowel Crohn’s disease will present with a sausage-like, palpable \nmass, which may be tender and is associated with diarrhoea.\nSmall bowel\nIf there is a mass palpable in the right iliac fossa the site of pathology \nis likely to be in the terminal ileum. This usually involves central \nabdominal colicky pain and a change in bowel habit.

Ectopic pregnancy will present with a missed period \nand abdominal pain, bleeding PV, and collapse with hypovolaemic \nshock if it ruptures. Salpingo-oophoritis will present with lower \nabdominal pain and tenderness and associated fever, and often a \npurulent vaginal discharge. Menorrhagia, lower abdominal pain and \ndyspareunia may suggest fibroids.\nRetroperitoneum\nThe patient may present having noticed a pulsatile swelling in the \niliac fossa. Pelvic lymphadenopathy may be suspected by history \nof removal of a malignant lesion from the lower limb, especially \nmalignant melanoma. There may be an existing lesion present on the \nlimb. A dull, boring pain may be suggestive of an iliac bone lesion. \nA palpable bony lesion suggests an osteogenic sarcoma or Ewing’s \ntumour of bone.\nEXAMINATION\nThe features of most of the lesions described above have been \ndescribed in the other sections on abdominal swellings. Only \nthose findings relevant to the ovary, uterus and fallopian tube will \nbe described here. Examination may reveal a greatly distended \nabdomen, which may be due to a huge ovarian cyst or ascites \nassociated with an ovarian neoplasm. Huge ovarian cysts are often \nsmooth and loculated. It is impossible to get below them as they \narise out of the pelvis. Signs of ascites include shifting dullness and a \nfluid thrill. With ectopic pregnancy, there may be a palpable mass in \neither iliac fossa. This may be associated with shock if rupture of the \nectopic pregnancy has occurred. Shoulder-tip pain may occur from \nirritation of the undersurface of the diaphragm with blood. With \ntubo-ovarian abscess there may be a palpable mass arising out of the \npelvis, or merely lower abdominal tenderness. Vaginal examination \nwill reveal tenderness in the pouch of Douglas.

A past history of prolapsing piles, with failure to reduce \nthem, associated with pain and tenderness suggests thrombosed \nhaemorrhoids. Gradual onset of pain and tenderness with swelling is \nsuggestive of abscess formation. A careful history must be taken of \ntrauma. A history of anal sexual exposure will suggest gonorrhoea \nor herpes. With gonorrhoea there may be irritation, itching, \ndischarge and pain. With herpes there will be pain and irritation. \nProctalgia fugax is diagnosed on the history of perineal pain, which \nis spasmodic, the spasms lasting up to 30 min. The pain often feels \ndeep inside the rectum. The cause is unknown but may be related to \nparoxysmal contraction of levator ani.

Acute disc lesions usually \noccur in the younger patient. A careful history is needed to exclude \ntrauma.\nBrachial plexus lesions refer pain down the arm and may result \nfrom localised lesions, e.g. a cervical rib causing extrinsic compression \nwill affect T1 and cause wasting of the small muscles of the hands \nand paraesthesia in the dermatomal distribution, i.e. the inner aspect \nof the upper arm.\nSubclavian artery stenosis will result in ‘claudication’ in the arm, \ni.e. pain brought on by exercise, relieved by rest, due to inadequate \nblood flow. A history of cardiac problems, e.g. AF or widespread \narterial disease, will suggest embolism or thrombosis. A sudden \nonset of a painful, swollen, cyanotic limb will suggest axillary vein \nthrombosis. Pain radiating into the left arm brought on by exercise \nand related to central chest pain and pain radiating into the neck \nsuggests myocardial ischaemia. Pain associated with occupation, \ne.g. writing, word-processing (keyboard occupations), will suggest \nrepetitive strain injury. A history of diabetes mellitus, renal failure, \nliver failure, alcohol abuse, vitamin B12 deficiency, drugs, e.g. \nphenytoin, vincristine, suggests peripheral neuropathy.\nPain, paraesthesia in the thumb, index and middle finger, which \nis worse in bed at night and relieved by hanging the arm out of \nbed, would suggest carpal tunnel syndrome. The latter may be \nassociated with pregnancy, rheumatoid arthritis, myxoedema, \nanterior dislocation of the lunate, gout, acromegaly, amyloidosis \nand arteriovenous fistula at the wrist created for haemodialysis.\nLocalised bone pain may be due to primary or secondary tumours. \nThe latter are most common and may result from a primary in the \nbreast, bronchus, thyroid, prostate or kidney. Pathological fractures \nmay occur. With compartment syndrome there may be a history of \ncrush injury, vascular injury or vascular surgery. Chronic compartment \nsyndrome may result from unusual exertion, e.g. weight-lifting.\nEXAMINATION\nA full neurological examination should be carried out, looking for \ncervical lesions, brachial plexus lesions or carpal tunnel syndrome. \nThere may be limitation in movements of the cervical spine. The \nlimbs should be examined for swelling, e.g. axillary vein thrombosis, \nwhen there will be cyanosis and dilated veins. Examine for signs \nof ischaemia and feel for pulses. The classical signs of an ischaemic \nlimb, i.e. pain, pallor, pulselessness, paraesthesia, ‘perishing cold’ and \nparalysis, may be present. Occupation will suggest repetitive strain \ninjury and there will usually be little to find on examination. Horner’s \nsyndrome (ptosis, miosis, enophthalmos and anhidrosis) suggests \nPancoast’s tumour. With bone tumours there will be localised \nswelling and tenderness.

Localised swellings may be \nrelated to joints or fractures. Localised swellings around joints are \ncovered in the section on joint disorders (p. 250). This section includes \nonly those conditions that may cause generalised swelling of the arm.\nCAUSES\n• Trauma\n• Infection\n• e.g. cellulitis, lymphangitis\n• Axillary vein thrombosis\n• Lymphoedema\n• Congenital\n• Acquired\n• Axillary node lesions\n• Carcinoma\n• Infection, e.g. filariasis\n• Excision\n• Radiotherapy\n• Other\n• Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (Sudek’s atrophy)\nHISTORY\nA history of trauma will be obvious in many cases, although \npathological fractures may occur with little trauma. Reflex \nsympathetic dystrophy may follow trauma, e.g. Colles’ fracture. \nCongenital lymphoedema of the arm is rare; however, secondary \nlymphoedema is not and a history of carcinoma of the breast, \noperations on the axilla or radiotherapy to the axilla should be \nsought. There may be a history of a puncture wound or flea bite, \nsuggesting cellulitis or lymphangitis. Streptococcal cellulitis is \ncommon following puncture wounds in patients who already have \nlymphoedema of a limb. Axillary vein thrombosis may come on \nafter excessive or unusual exercise and has been nicknamed ‘effort \nthrombosis’. An example is a patient who has been painting a ceiling \nwho is not used to doing that sort of thing. It may occur in patients \nwith cervical ribs or thoracic inlet obstruction. Thrombosis may also \noccur following insertion of a central line.\nEXAMINATION\nThere may be localised swelling and tenderness together with \ncrepitus associated with a fracture.

Cirrhosis of the liver may result \nfrom alcoholism, previous hepatitis, Wilson’s disease, primary \nand secondary biliary cirrhosis and haemochromatosis. A previous \nhistory of TB should raise suspicion of secondary \ndisease.\nAssociated symptoms\nShortness of breath can result from splinting of the diaphragm due \nto tense ascites itself, or secondarily as part of the syndrome of \ncardiac failure when it is the underlying cause.\nEXAMINATION\nClassical findings are shifting dullness and a fluid thrill. As \nliver disease and carcinomatosis account for 90% of the cases \npresenting with ascites, a detailed examination of all systems \nis required. The next commonest causes are cardiac failure and \nnephrotic syndrome.\nInspection\nEvidence of liver disease would be suggested by the presence of \njaundice, spider naevi, loss of body hair, gynaecomastia, palmar \nerythema and caput medusae. The jugular venous pressure (JVP) is \nelevated in the presence of cardiac failure, and a prominent n wave \nis seen with tricuspid regurgitation. Further elevation of the JVP \non inspiration (Kussmaul’s sign) may be observed with a pericardial \neffusion.\nPalpation\nCareful abdominal examination should be performed to look for \npossible abdominal or pelvic tumours. ‘Dipping’ may be required \nSUBASH KC/NMC-15TH/2014\n",

Pain from aortic \ndissection often radiates into the back and occasionally into the \nabdomen (depending on the extent of the dissection). Pulmonary \npain can be located anywhere in the thorax.\nPrecipitating factors\nAngina may be precipitated by effort, a defining characteristic. Other \nknown precipitants of angina are emotion, food and cold weather. \nIf angina occurs at rest for more than 20 min it should be treated \nas a myocardial infarction until proven otherwise. Oesophageal \nreflux is often related to meals and precipitated by changes in \nposture, such as bending or lying. Pain originating from pericarditis \nand pulmonary origin is often pleuritic, i.e. worse on inspiration; \nhowever, musculoskeletal pain can also be worse on breathing due \nto movement of the thorax.\nRelieving factors\nBoth oesophageal spasm and angina may be relieved by GTN, which \nrelaxes smooth muscle. Antacids will relieve the pain of oesophageal \nreflux but not angina. The pain associated with pericarditis may be \nrelieved by sitting forwards.\nTrauma\nA history of a blunt or stretching injury immediately suggests the \nunderlying aetiology of chest wall tenderness and it is important \nto diagnose rib fractures that can result from more severe trauma. \nPathological rib fractures that result from minor injuries may be due \nto bony metastasis or osteoporosis.\nEmotion\nOccasionally chest pain is a somatic manifestation of patients with \ndepression or anxiety, but it is essential to exclude all organic causes \nbefore accepting depression or anxiety as the underlying cause. \nMoreover a serious aetiology may co-exist.\nEXAMINATION\nTemperature\nPyrexia can occur with pneumonia, myocardial infarction, pericarditis \nand herpes zoster infection.\nPulse\nHeart rate on its own is not discriminating as pain invariably leads to \ntachycardia.

The \npresence of unilateral tenderness confined to a single or adjacent \ngroup of dermatomes would suggest either central (vertebral or \nspinal origin) or peripheral nerve pathology (herpes zoster infection). \nThe trachea deviates away from the side of a tension pneumothorax, \nand chest expansion is decreased on the same side for pneumonia \nand pneumothorax.

Occasionally one may find the S1Q3T3 \npattern (S wave in lead I, Q wave and an inverted T wave in \nlead III), indicative of right heart strain.\n■\n■\nCXR\nThe line of the pleura with absence of lung markings distal to it \nis the usual finding for a pneumothorax. Areas of consolidation \non a chest film may be confined to a lobe or widespread in \nbronchopneumonia. The classic wedge-shaped shadow (base \nis distal) of a pulmonary embolus is rare, and occurs only if \npulmonary infarction resulted. Dissection of the aorta may \nwiden its width, causing a bulge to appear at the right \nmediastinal border.

A detailed discussion on the diagnosis of \ncongenital cyanotic heart disease (tetralogy of Fallot, transposition \nof great arteries, total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage) is \nbeyond the scope of this text.\nDuration\nThe duration of clubbing may give an indication of the underlying \naetiology. Clubbing present since infancy would suggest a familial \ntrait or congenital cyanotic heart disease. Alternatively, it may be \na secondary manifestation of hereditary disorders such as coeliac \ndisease and cystic fibrosis.\nRespiratory symptoms\nA history of cough, haemoptysis, dyspnoea and weight loss in \na chronic smoker should alert the clinician to the diagnosis of \nbronchial carcinoma. Symptoms of metastasis (bone pain, jaundice) \nand paraneoplastic involvement (neuropathy, thirst and polyuria \nfrom hypercalcaemia) should also be ascertained. With bronchial \ncarcinoma, clubbing may be part of a generalised arthritic \nmanifestation of hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy.\nCough productive of copious amounts of purulent sputum is \nusually the main complaint with bronchiectasis. With a chronic lung \nabscess or empyema, the symptoms are often less specific and may \nbe preceded by a history of pneumonia or aspiration secondary \nto neurological disorders, dysphagia or alcoholism. Patients may \npresent with a persistent low-grade pyrexia, malaise, weight loss and \nproductive cough. Shortness of breath and a non-productive cough \ncharacterise interstitial lung disease.\nGastrointestinal symptoms\nMalaise, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and weight loss are experienced \nby most patients with inflammatory bowel disease and coeliac \ndisease. The presence of aphthous ulceration, fistulae and \nperianal sepsis are suggestive of Crohn’s disease. Predominantly \nrectal involvement with tenesmus, mucus and blood PR is more \ncharacteristic of ulcerative colitis; however, differentiation based on \nthe history alone can be very difficult. Symptoms of coeliac disease \ntend to be very variable and non-specific, with non-bloody diarrhoea \nwith steatorrhoea.\nHeavy alcohol consumption or previous infection with hepatitis \nB will predispose to cirrhosis of the liver. Patients may complain \nof jaundice, abdominal distension due to ascites (p. 33), upper \ngastrointestinal haemorrhage due to varices or bruising from \nimpaired clotting (p. 526).

The mucous \nmembranes should be inspected for central cyanosis, which may be a \nfeature of, or sequel to, congenital cyanotic heart disease. Cyanosis \nmay also be noticeable with any of the above causes of severe lung \ndisease. Aphthous ulceration occurs with Crohn’s and coeliac disease. \nA goitre, exophthalmos, ophthalmoplegia and a resting tremor are \nfeatures of Graves’ disease.\nWith infective endocarditis, splinter haemorrhages, Osler’s nodes \n(raised tender lesions on the pulps of the fingers) and Janeway \nlesions (flat non-tender macules on the palms and soles) may also be \npresent.\nTemperature\nPyrexia is notable in several important causes of clubbing, namely \nsuppurative lung disease, infective endocarditis and active \ninflammatory bowel disease.\nExamination of the chest\nAuscultation of the precordium may reveal new or changing \nmurmurs with infective endocarditis. Widespread coarse crepitations \nof the lungs occur with retained secretions of bronchiectasis. Fine \nquality end-inspiratory crepitations are suggestive of interstitial lung \ndisease. More localised coarse crepitations and dullness to percussion \nmay be found with a lung abscess. Findings suggestive of pleural \neffusion (unilateral decreased expansion, dullness to percussion and \nabsent breath sounds) may be due to malignancy. However, when \nthis is associated with pyrexia in an ill patient, it should lead to the \nconsideration of a thoracic empyema.\nAbdominal examination\nOn abdominal examination, signs of chronic liver disease (p. 34) \nmay be present; however, there may be few specific features \nto suggest inflammatory bowel disease. When this diagnosis \nis suspected, a sigmoidoscopy should always be performed. \nOccasionally, right iliac fossa tenderness or a mass may be found in \nCrohn’s disease.

Other sources of information are previous hospital notes, \nrecords kept by general practitioners, and tablets or \nprescriptions that have been found at the patient’s premises.\nPresentation\nThe circumstances regarding discovery of the patient is usually the \nfirst piece of information to be reported. Trauma patients may have \nbeen transported from sites of road traffic accidents, fire or have \nbeen found assaulted on the street. When teenagers are brought \nin unconscious from a night club, it is important to exclude alcohol \nintoxication, epilepsy, hypoglycaemia and the effects of illicit \ndrugs (malignant hyperthermia with ‘ecstasy’). Attempted suicides \nmay have an accompanying note, or drug bottles may have been \nrecovered from the scene. Carbon monoxide poisoning occurs with \nsuicide attempts in enclosed areas with running engines or may be a \ncomplication in victims involved with fires. Patients who have been \nbrought in from cold environments may also have hypothermia in \naddition to the primary event.\nOnset\nWhen witnessed, information regarding the speed of onset of coma \nmay help in determining a cause. Sudden onset of unconsciousness is \ncharacteristic of a seizure or a vascular event.\nTrauma\nHead injuries are a common cause of coma, but not all causes \nare due to blunt trauma to the cranium. Diffuse axonal injury \nresults from severe shearing forces on the brain, a sequel to rapid \nacceleration and deceleration forces. Blunt head injuries may cause \nextradural haemorrhages as a result of skull fractures with laceration \nof meningeal arteries. There is usually a history of an injury with \ntransient loss of consciousness, a lucid interval in which the patient \nfeels and appears well, followed by drowsiness, headache, vomiting, \nprogressive hemiplegia and eventually coma. Subdural haemorrhages \nare a consequence of severe trauma with cortical lacerations or less \nsevere trauma with laceration of bridging veins.

Progressive headache, worse in the mornings and associated \nwith vomiting, may be due to raised intracranial pressure from a \ncerebral tumour.\nPredisposing factors\nThe history of possible predisposing factors is useful when assessing \nthe comatose patient. The presence of diabetes should lead to the \nconsideration of ketoacidosis (type I diabetics) and hypoglycaemia \n(oral hypoglycaemic or insulin dosage errors). Patients with known \nhepatic or renal failure may deteriorate to coma as a result of \nencephalopathy or uraemia, respectively. Coma may also complicate \nsevere hypothyroidism. Previous suicide attempts or a history of \ndepression should lead to the consideration of drug overdose. \nEpileptic patients may be in status epilepticus or in a post-ictal \nrecovery state. Pre-existing cardiac or respiratory disease may result \nin coma as a terminal event.\nEXAMINATION\nTemperature\nBody temperature should be recorded and a series of normal body \ntemperatures will exclude hypothermia and hyperpyrexia as a \nconsequence of heat stroke or illicit drug use.\nGeneral examination\nA thorough inspection should be performed. This will necessitate \nremoval of clothing, log rolling (to examine the back) and a detailed \nexamination of the scalp for bleeding, haematomas and fractures. \nThe presence of bilateral periorbital haematomas or cerebrospinal \nfluid rhinorrhoea may indicate an anterior fossa fracture of the \nskull. Bruising over the mastoid (Battle’s sign) or cerebrospinal fluid \notorrhoea may be due to a middle cranial fossa fracture. Patients \nwith carbon monoxide poisoning may appear bright red. Patients \nwith myxoedema are characteristically obese, with coarse features, \ndry skin and brittle hair.

Constipation may occur from pressure from adjacent \norgans, e.g. with pregnancy, ovarian cyst or large fibroids. \nDiverticular disease with or without stricture may cause constipation.\nPainful anus\nPatients may become constipated from any anal disorder that results \nin pain on defecation. The most common cause is fissure-in-ano, \nand other causes include strangulated haemorrhoids (the patient \noften giving a past history of haemorrhoids), perianal abscess and \nhaemorrhoidectomy.\nAdynamic bowel\nParalytic ileus may follow abdominal surgery or abdominal \ninflammatory conditions. It may also arise following spinal fractures \nor prolonged bedrest, especially in the elderly. The patient’s main \ncomplaint is usually of a distended abdomen.\nEndocrine\nCheck for a history of diabetes as diabetic autonomic neuropathy \nper se can result in constipation. Myxoedema result, in constipation \nand there may be associated symptoms of cold intolerance, coarse \nhair and skin changes. Hypercalcaemia (e.g. hyperparathyroidism) is \nassociated with constipation and symptoms include nocturia, nausea, \nvomiting, abdominal pain and mental disturbances.\nDrugs\nTake a careful drug history.

A prodrome or aura \nmay be associated with the onset of a seizure.\nPrecipitating factors\nThe history should start with precipitating factors, e.g. causes such \nas trauma, surgery and drug overdose. Flashing lights may \nprecipitate a seizure in patients with a past history of epilepsy.\nHeadache\nConvulsions associated with headaches may be due to \ntrauma, subarachnoid haemorrhage, meningitis or raised \nintracranial pressure from a tumour. Patients with subarachnoid \nhaemorrhage may also complain of sudden onset of blinding \nheadache. The headache associated with meningitis is often \naccompanied with neck stiffness and photophobia. In the \npresence of raised intracranial pressure, the headache tends to \nbe worse in the mornings and on coughing or sneezing. It may \nbe associated with nausea or vomiting. For a fuller description, \nsee p. 207.\nAssociated neurology\nPre-existing neurological impairment before the onset of \nconvulsions has important implications. A stroke, subarachnoid \nhaemorrhage or intracranial bleed may precipitate neurological \nimpairment preceding a convulsion. Chronic progressive \nimpairment preceding a seizure may be a result of tumour \ngrowth. In the post-ictal period, transient motor weakness \nmay accompany epilepsy (Todd’s palsy). Permanent neurological \ndeficit can be induced by cerebral anoxia from prolonged \nseizures.\nPast medical and drug history\nCo-existing disease such as diabetes will predispose to \nabnormalities of serum glucose concentrations.

The duration of \nsymptoms may coincide with the introduction of ototoxic drugs.\nOnset\nSudden onset of deafness can result from foreign bodies in the \nexternal auditory canal. Deafness usually occurs only if the foreign \nbody perforates the tympanic membrane or disrupts the chain of \nossicles. Sudden onset of deafness may also result from trauma, \nvascular catastrophes or Ménière’s disease. Gradual development of \ndeafness occurs with otosclerosis, tumours and age.\nPain\nDeafness associated with ear pain may be a result of otitis \nexterna, otitis media or infection with herpes zoster. Severe pain \nis experienced with both direct trauma perforating the tympanic \nmembrane and barotrauma, which can result from a slap on the ear \nor scuba diving.\nPrecipitating factors\nA history of trauma is usually obvious. Sensorineural deafness can \nresult as a complication of mumps or from prolonged exposure to \nhigh noise levels.\nAssociated symptoms\nTinnitus in combination with episodic deafness and vertigo occur \nwith Ménière’s disease. When tinnitus occurs with deafness alone, \nconsider otosclerosis, noise exposure, ototoxic drugs and acoustic \nneuroma.\nDrug history\nOffending drugs can easily be determined from a drug history.\nEXAMINATION\nExamination of the ear\nOn inspection, the vesicles of herpes zoster or presence of otitis \nexterna may be obvious. With otitis externa, the skin appears \nerythematous with scaling and exudation. Tenderness will be elicited \nby movement of the pinna or compression of the tragus.\nOtoscopic examination will identify ear wax or foreign bodies \noccluding the external auditory canal.

Patients with BPPV \ncomplain of short episodes of dizziness accompanying changes in the \nposition of the head. Labyrinthitis may result either as a complication \nof systemic viral infection or from extension of a cholesteatoma \ndue to chronic suppurative otitis media. A history of trauma is \nusually obvious. Postural dizziness precipitated by rising from a \nlying position may be caused by orthostatic hypotension commonly \nsecondary to anti hypertensive drugs.\nAssociated symptoms\nDizziness may be precipitated by arrhythmia and patients may \ncomplain of associated palpitations. It may also be experienced with \nmigraine attacks and patients may complain of associated unilateral \nthrobbing headache, nausea, vomiting and photophobia. Ménière’s \ndisease is diagnosed with a history of episodic severe vertigo with \ncontinuous tinnitus and hearing loss. Patients with vertebrobasilar \ninsufficiency from cervical spondylosis may complain of dizziness \nwith extension of the neck. With posterior circulation TIAs, sudden \nonset of dizziness is caused by ischaemia of the lateral brainstem or \ncerebellum. This may be accompanied by syncope, nausea, vomiting, \nvisual field defects and diplopia. Severe progressive vomiting \nand ataxia may also result from intracerebellar haemorrhage, a \nneurosurgical emergency. Patients with anxiety disorders may \nexperience attacks of dizziness, tinnitus and tremor, with or without \naccompanying hyperventilation. Certainly hyperventilation alone is \nsufficient to precipitate dizziness. Vertigo is a prominent feature of \nmultiple sclerosis when demyelination occurs in the brainstem; this \nmay be accompanied by dysarthria and cranial nerve palsies. Young \nage would favour the diagnosis of demyelination over ischaemia. \nTumours of the cerebellopontine angle tend to present gradually, \ndizziness may be mild and this may be accompanied by numbness \nand facial paralysis due to trigeminal and facial nerve involvement. \nThere are no precipitating factors for vestibular neuronitis, the \ndizziness is not associated with nausea or tinnitus.\nDrug history\nNumerous drugs have ototoxic effects; perhaps the most commonly \nknown are aminoglycosides and frusemide.\nEXAMINATION\nAssessment of nystagmus, hearing and positional testing provide \nthe most amount of information when determining the cause of \ndizziness.\nMultidirectional nystagmus results from diffuse cerebellar \ndisease, while unidirectional nystagmus occurs either with \nSUBASH KC/NMC-15TH/2014\n",

Aspiration of \na foreign body may be determined from the history; however, \naspiration of vomit is more difficult as it usually occurs in patients \nwith decreased consciousness levels or who have lost the gag reflex. \nDyspnoea on recumbency is caused by cardiac failure; occasionally \npatients may complain of waking up at night gasping for breath \nwhen they slide down the pillows (paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea). \nDyspnoea associated with asthma may be seasonal (grass pollen) \nor perennial (house-dust mite faecal proteins), depending on \nthe precipitating allergen. A history of severe allergy should \nlead to the consideration of anaphylaxis. Stressful events can \nprecipitate asthma attacks but may also cause anxious patients to \nhyperventilate.\nRelieving factors\nDyspnoea resulting from cardiac failure may be relieved by sitting \nupright, and, when due to asthma, by beta agonists.\nAssociated factors\nCough productive of (green, yellow, rusty) sputum indicates the \npresence of a chest infection. This may be the primary cause or it \nmay exacerbate dyspnoea in patients with an existing condition \nsuch as asthma, COPD or cardiac failure. Bloodstained sputum may \nresult from a chest infection (especially TB), pulmonary embolism or \na tumour.

      "text": "120\nEYE DISORDERS\nHISTORY\nPain\nMost disorders of the eye present with pain. Sudden onset of \nunilateral eye pain and lacrimation may be due to a foreign \nbody. Patients with infective conjunctivitis tend to complain of a \nsoreness rather than true pain. Patients with blepharitis complain \nof a foreign body sensation or grittiness, whereas patients with \nallergic conjunctivitis (hayfever, acute allergy or atopy) tend to \ncomplain of itching rather than pain. Severe pain is experienced \nwith corneal abrasions, ulcers, angle-closure glaucoma, herpes \nzoster ophthalmicus, uveitis and scleritis. Patients with either \nof the last two conditions experience exacerbation of pain on \npalpating the globe. A stye is a suppurative inflammation of an \neyelash follicle. It is common and extremely painful. A meibomian \ncyst is an infection of a meibomian gland, which is in the posterior \nhalf of the eyelid margin. Following inflammation of a meibomian \ngland, it may either resolve spontaneously or leave a pea-size \nswelling known as a chalazion. Entropion is the rolling inwards of \nthe lid margin. The eyelashes irritate the conjunctiva and cornea, \ncausing a painful red eye. The opposite condition is known as \nectropion and usually results in a watery eye. Subconjunctival \nhaemorrhages are usually spontaneous and, although they may \npresent with impressive chemosis (soft-tissue swelling), they are \nnot usually painful.\nVisual disturbance\nImpairment of vision can occur with corneal ulceration, uveitis \nand acute angle-closure glaucoma. This is usually associated with \nphotophobia. In addition, patients with glaucoma may perceive \nhalos around lights due to corneal oedema.\nDischarge\nDocumenting the presence, amount and colour of any discharge \noriginating from the eye is important. A purulent discharge is \nassociated with bacterial and chlamydial conjunctivitis, and a clear \ndischarge with allergic and viral conjunctivitis.\nPast medical history\nA history of atopy or hayfever may be present in patients with \nallergic conjunctivitis. Previous herpes infection on the face may \nbe the only clue with dendritic corneal ulceration. Conjunctivitis, \nurethritis and arthritis form the triad of Reiter’s syndrome caused \nby Chlamydia trachomatis infection. A history of contact lens use \nis important, as patients may develop sight-threatening infections \nacutely.\nSUBASH KC/NMC-15TH/2014\n",

      "text": "121\nEYE DISORDERS\nSection A\nScleritis is a deeper and more severe inflammatory process than \nepiscleritis. It tends to be associated with connective tissue diseases, \nsuch as rheumatoid disease and SLE.\nUveitis is associated with inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, \nankylosing spondylitis and sarcoidosis. Orbital congestion may \nbe seen in patients with thyroid disorders. Xanthelasma are fatty \nplaques in the skin of the eyelids. Extensive or multiple xanthelasma \nmay indicate abnormalities of cholesterol metabolism, diabetes or \narterial disease.\nEXAMINATION\nVisual acuity should be assessed with correcting spectacles or \npinhole, and documented with reference to a Snellen chart. \nConditions that present with visual impairment are corneal \nulceration, uveitis and glaucoma. Patients with these conditions \nshould be referred to an ophthalmologist. The eyelids should be \ncarefully inspected. Swelling of the upper eyelid with redness may \nindicate a stye. There may be a bead of pus apparent at the infected \nhair follicle. The upper eyelid is everted to inspect for a meibomian \ncyst and foreign bodies. Papillae (conjunctival elevations with a \nvessel in the centre) are seen with allergic conjunctivitis, and follicles \n(collections of lymphocytes) may be visible with viral or chlamydial \ninfection. Ectropion and entropion are usually obvious: in the \nformer the lower eyelid is everted and in the latter it is inverted, the \neyelashes scratch the conjunctiva and cornea giving rise to a red, \nwatery eye. A similar effect is produced by trichiasis, which is caused \nby irregular pointing lashes. Xanthelasma are fatty plaques in the \nskin of the eyelids. They look like masses of yellow opaque fat. They \nare not painful or tender.\nInspection is then undertaken to identify the presence of any \nforeign bodies on the surface of the eye. Areas of erythema should \nbe carefully assessed. Diffuse erythema, maximal in the fornices, is \na feature of conjunctivitis. Localised areas of segmental erythema \nmay be due to episcleritis, but if it is maximal near the limbus it may \nbe a focal keratitis. Scleritis produces a brawny red discoloration, \nwhile a deep crimson-red area is observed with subconjunctival \nhaemorrhage. Marked erythema adjacent to the iris is known as a \nciliary flush and occurs with anterior uveitis and glaucoma.\nAttention is then focused on to the cornea. Ulceration of the \ncornea may not be visible without fluorescein staining. Infection may \nextend to the anterior chamber, and a collection of pus (hypopyon) \ncan present as a white fluid level. Loss of brightness of the cornea \noccurs with glaucoma due to corneal oedema.\nThe pupil is examined and the resting position noted. A constricted \npupil may result from ciliary spasm with uveitis and it rests in a fixed, \nsemi-dilated position with glaucoma.\nSUBASH KC/NMC-15TH/2014\n",

Therefore \nwhen formulating a differential diagnosis, consider the conditions \naffecting the anatomical structures of the face.\nSite\nThe site of pain is perhaps the most useful feature when \ndiscriminating between the causes. Although local tenderness may \ndirect the clinician to the affected site, do not forget to consider \nreferred pain from adjacent structures. Pain in the region of the ear \nmay be referred from the skin, teeth, tonsils, pharynx, larynx or neck. \nTenderness over the maxilla may be due to sinusitis, dental abscess or \ncarcinoma.\nCharacter\nPatients with trigeminal neuralgia often describe paroxysms of sharp, \nsevere pains in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve or major \ndivisions. Pain associated with infections of structures such as the \nteeth, mastoid and ear often has a dull, aching quality.\nPrecipitating factors\nPain precipitated by food or chewing action may be due to a \ndental abscess, salivary gland disorder, salivary duct disorder, \ntemporomandibular joint disorder or jaw claudication due to \ntemporal arteritis. Pain arising from most structures is aggravated \nby touch; however, with trigeminal neuralgia, even the slightest \nstroking of the skin is sufficient to produce intense pain (allodynia).\nAssociated symptoms\nTears may result when the lacrimal duct is obstructed by \nnasopharyngeal carcinoma. Complaints of otorrhoea and hearing loss \nshould direct the clinician to infections affecting the ear or mastoid. \nNasal obstruction and rhinorrhoea occur with maxillary sinusitis \nand carcinoma of the maxillary antrum. These may be accompanied \nby unilateral epistaxis. Swelling of the cheek may be experienced \nwith dental abscesses and maxillary carcinoma. Proximal muscle \npain, stiffness and subjective weakness may accompany temporal \narteritis due to associated polymyalgia rheumatica. Paraesthesia in \nthe distribution of the trigeminal nerve often precedes the rash of \nherpes zoster.\nEXAMINATION\nInspection\nA thorough inspection of the face, salivary glands, ear,  nose and\nthroat may produce a wealth of information.

Pyrexia and \nmalaise may occur. Dental infections are common (see Jaw pain and \nswellings, p. 245) and are often initially localised, but the side of the \nface may swell. There is severe associated throbbing pain. Sinusitis \npresents with constant unilateral pain over the frontal or maxillary \nsinuses. There is usually puffiness of the skin overlying the sinus. \nParotitis presents with pain and swelling over the gland. If this is due \nto obstruction in the duct, the swelling occurs during eating, when \nthe patient salivates, and regresses afterwards. Bilateral parotitis \noccurs with mumps.\nNeoplastic\nNeoplasia may affect the parotids, sinuses and jaw. There is usually \nlocalised swelling with carcinoma of the sinuses. The patient \ncomplains of a blocked nose and a bloodstained discharge, which \nmay be foul-smelling. With neoplastic lesions of the jaws there \nis usually deep-seated boring pain in relation to the swelling. \nMediastinal tumours compress the superior vena cava and may \ncause suffusion of the face and facial oedema.\nVascular\nSuperior vena caval thrombosis may occur. This is rare and there may \nhave been long-term central venous cannulation. There is cyanotic \nsuffusion of the face with facial oedema. Cavernous sinus thrombosis \nusually presents following a history of infection of the face or in the \nsinuses. There may be a history of immunosuppression or diabetes. \nThe patient complains of pain in the eye and forehead, with swelling \naround the eye and a protruding eye. The swelling may eventually \ninvolve the whole of the side of the face. Double vision occurs as a \nresult of cranial nerve involvement.\nEndocrine\nCushing’s syndrome presents with swelling of the face (moon \nface) with a typical red appearance. Facial swelling is also seen in \nacromegaly. The patient will usually complain of an increase in shoe \nsize and large hands. There may also be a hoarse voice, protrusion \nof the jaw and cardiac failure.

In the case of the face, \nanaesthesia may have arisen following surgery to the trigeminal \nganglion for trigeminal neuralgia. Syringobulbia is a rare cause of \nfacial anaesthesia. Check for a history of bites, insect, animal or \nhuman, which may become infected and ulcerate.\nMalignant ulcers are usually on exposed areas of the face. Check \nthe patient’s occupation. Malignancy is more common in outdoor \nworkers exposed to ultraviolet light. Most rodent ulcers occur above \na line drawn from the angle of the mouth to the lobe of the ear. \nTheir incidence increases with increasing age. Malignant ulcers \nare usually painless unless they become infected. They may be \npigmented and there may be a history of a change in a pre-existing \nmole to suggest malignant melanoma. These changes include: \nchange in size; change in colour, with deepening pigmentation; \nbleeding or ulceration; itching; inflammatory ‘halo’; satellite nodules; \npalpable regional lymph nodes.\nInfection may be due to herpes simplex, which may spread from \naround the lips or nose. The patient will complain of an itchy, \nburning red area on which vesicles form and then crust over and \nulcerate. Herpes zoster may arise in the distribution of the trigeminal \nnerve. Pain precedes malaise and fever by a few days. Vesicles \ndevelop later and may ulcerate. Syphilis is rare and may give rise to \neither a chancre or gumma (see Lip lesions, p. 299).

There would  \nbe a history of bite leaving an itchy papule, leading to an ulcer.  \nKeratoacanthoma may be due to a virus. It resembles a squamous  \ncell carcinoma, from which it needs to be carefully distinguished.  \nIt occurs in adults as a rapidly growing lump with a central core filled \nwith keratin.

There may \nbe pain and discomfort. Again, the condition may be noted by the \nchild’s parent. There may be no specific cause. Alternatively, there \nmay be a history of spina bifida, spina bifida occulta, poliomyelitis, \nor rarely Friedreich’s ataxia, for which there will be a family history, \nCharcot–Marie–Tooth disease begins at puberty with foot drop and \nweakness in the legs.\nAcquired talipes\nThere are a variety of causes of upper and lower motor neurone \nlesions giving rise to acquired talipes. Check for a history of spastic \nparesis, cerebrovascular accident, spina bifida, poliomyelitis. There may \nbe a family history of Friedreich’s ataxia. The patient may be known \nto have muscular dystrophy. With Volkmann’s ischaemic contracture \nthere will be a history of ischaemia of the calf muscles, e.g. from \nsupracondylar fracture of the femur with popliteal artery damage.\nTrauma\nThere will usually be an obvious history of trauma or of burns \ncausing contractures.\nEXAMINATION\nTalipes equinovarus\nThis will usually be apparent in the newborn. There is an equinus \ndeformity, i.e. the hindfoot is drawn up with a tight Achilles tendon; \nvarus deformity – the sole faces inwards; and adduction of the \nforefoot – the inner border of the forefoot is concave and points \nupwards.\nSUBASH KC/NMC-15TH/2014\n",

They occur over \npressure areas but the surrounding tissues are healthy and have \ngood circulation. The ulcers themselves are painless. Examine \nthe surrounding tissues for blunting of sensation, e.g. absence \nof pinprick sensation. Pulses are usually present. Carry out a full \nneurological examination looking for peripheral nerve injuries or \nevidence of spinal cord lesions.\nNeoplastic\nSquamous cell carcinomas have an everted edge, often with necrotic \nmaterial in the base of the ulcer. The edge of the ulcer is hard. Check \nfor inguinal lymphadenopathy. Ulcers associated with malignant \nmelanoma tend to vary from brown to black, although they may \nbe amelanotic. Bleeding and infection may make the surface \nof the tumour appear wet, soft and boggy. Check for inguinal \nlymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly.\nTraumatic\nTraumatic ulcers tend to occur either at pressure points, due to ill-\nfitting footwear, or at a site of injury. They usually have sloping \nedges and granulation tissue developing in the base. Always check \nthe circulation, as most traumatic foot ulcers readily heal unless \nthere is an abnormality of the circulation.\nInfective\nInfective ulcers by themselves are rare. Secondary infection may occur \non any type of ulcer. With Madura foot there may be ulceration and \nbone destruction with little systemic illness.\nGENERAL INVESTIGATIONS\n■\n■\nFBC, ESR\nHb  malignant disease. WCC  infection.

When assessing \ngait, it is important to observe the whole patient and not merely the \nfeet.\nCAUSES\nSTRUCTURAL\n• Pain – antalgic gait\n• Length discrepancies – short leg gait\n• Weak hip abductors – Trendelenburg or waddling gait\n• Femoral anteversion – intoe gait\nNEUROLOGICAL\n• Stroke – hemiplegic gait\n• Parkinson’s disease – festinant gait\n• Peripheral neuropathy – sensory ataxia\n• Cerebellar disease – cerebellar ataxia\n• Peroneal nerve palsy – foot drop gait\n• Cerebral palsy – scissoring gait\n• Frontal lobe lesions – apraxic gait\nHISTORY\nDuration\nAn abnormality of gait that has been present since birth is usually \ndue to a structural cause or cerebral palsy. Discrepancies of length \nmay originate from disorders affecting joint articulation, bone \nlength or from soft-tissue contractures surrounding the joints. Most \nof the neurological causes of gait abnormalities result from acquired \nlesions of the central or peripheral nervous systems.\nAssociated symptoms\nPain is the underlying cause for the antalgic gait and patients will \nbe able to direct you to the site of origin of the pain. Loss of motor \nfunction such as paralysis of dorsiflexion of the foot causes the foot \ndrop gait, more extensive paralysis of the arm and leg with the \nhemiplegic gait may occur with stroke. Paraesthesia, sensory loss \nor impairment of joint position sense is suggestive of peripheral \nneuropathy. Patients with sensory apraxia suffer from proprioceptive \nimpairment and have great difficulties walking in the dark when \nvisual cues are lost. A concomitant resting tremor is associated with \nParkinson’s disease and an intention tremor results from cerebellar \ndisease.\nSUBASH KC/NMC-15TH/2014\n",

Fractures of the fibular neck may disrupt the common \nperoneal nerve causing foot drop. Frontal lobe contusions may \nresult from severe head injuries. Diabetes, carcinoma and vitamin B \ndeficiencies are associated with peripheral neuropathies. Alcoholism, \nmultiple sclerosis and drugs such as phenytoin are associated with \ncerebellar impairment. Direct questioning should be undertaken for \nprevious strokes and Parkinson’s disease.\nEXAMINATION\nThe clinical examination is divided into three sections. The initial \nexamination of a gait disorder is to determine a structural or \nneurological cause. If a structural lesion is suspected then it is \nfollowed by an orthopaedic examination. Conversely a neurological \nexamination is performed if a neurological lesion is suspected. Once \nthe disorder of gait is defined, the clinical examination should then \nbe tailored to determine the underlying cause.\nThe asymmetrical gait\nThe gait is first assessed for symmetry. Apart from the hemiplegic \ngait, the remaining unilateral gait disorders are structural. The \nnormal gait consists of several phases; there are the swing, heel \nstrike, stance and toe-off phases. The antalgic gait or painful limp \nis characterised by a decrease in time spent in the stance phase. The \nTrendelenburg gait is characterised by a downward tilt of the pelvis \nwhen the leg is lifted forwards. It may be caused by a painful hip \ndisorder, weakness of the contralateral hip abductors, shortening of \nthe femoral neck or subluxation of the hip joint. With a hemiplegic \ngait, the leg swings in an outward arc and then back to the midline. \nA foot drop gait often results in the knee being lifted higher on the \naffected side.\nThe symmetrical gait\nWhen analysing the symmetrical gait, observe movement of the \nwhole patient. The stooped posture with small shuffling steps and \nreduced arm swing is characteristic of Parkinson’s disease. Patients \nwith apraxia have disjointed movements akin to ‘walking on ice’, \nthe aetiology is frontal lobe disorder most commonly due to cortical \ndegeneration. Attention is then brought to the movement of the \nlegs, scissoring of the gait due to crossing of the midline when lifting \nthe leg forwards is associated with cerebral palsy. The movements \nof the feet are then noted, lifting of the knees with slapping of the \nfoot as it contacts with the ground is descriptive of the foot drop \ngait. The foot is rotated inwards with femoral anteversion. The \nbase of the gait is then analysed, a broad-based gait is characteristic \nSUBASH KC/NMC-15TH/2014\n",

With cerebellar disease, \npatients are unsteady standing with their eyes open, while with \nsensory ataxia patients are able to stand with their eyes open but not \nshut (positive Romberg’s test).\nOrthopaedic examination\nAn examination of the hip, knee and ankle is required. \nMeasurements are undertaken to determine real and apparent \nlength of the lower limbs. The real length is the distance between \nthe anterior superior iliac spine and the medial malleolus, and the \napparent length is the distance between the xiphisternum and \nthe medial malleolus. Any discrepancies will require individual \nmeasurements of the femur and tibia to determine the site of \nshortening. Thomas’ test is performed to identify the presence of \nfixed flexion deformities of the hip that can give rise to apparent \nshortening. The resting position of both feet can be inspected and \ninternal rotation due to femoral anteversion may be apparent.\nNeurological examination\nThe mask-like facies and resting pill-rolling tremor of Parkinson’s \ndisease may be apparent on inspection and examination of the \nlimbs will reveal cog wheel or lead pipe rigidity. Patients with \ncerebellar disease will exhibit an intention tremor when performing \nthe finger–nose test; in addition to their broad-based ataxic \ngait they may also exhibit nystagmus, dysdiadochokinesia and \ndysarthria. With frontal lobe disorders primitive reflexes such as \nthe grasping (the hand of the examiner is grasped when placed \nor stroked along the patient’s palm), sucking (sucking action is \nproduced on stroking on side of the mouth) and palmomental \nreflexes (gentle stroke of the thenar eminence produces dimpling \nof the chin) are released. Examination of the sensory system may \nreveal loss of light touch, vibration and proprioception in a glove \nand stocking distribution with peripheral neuropathy. Unilateral \nupper motor neurone weakness, hyperreflexia and clasp knife \nrigidity are features of cortical strokes.\nSpecific examination\nOnce the diagnosis of a gait disorder is made, a specific examination \nis now undertaken to determine the underlying aetiology. For \nexample, with apraxic gait due to frontal lobe disorder, a mental \nstate examination is performed to screen for dementia, and \nfundoscopy is performed to screen for papilloedema, which may  \nbe indicative of raised intracranial pressure from a brain tumour.\nGENERAL INVESTIGATIONS\nThe diagnosis of the majority of gait abnormalities is made on \nclinical history and examination.\nSUBASH KC/NMC-15TH/2014\n",

If the hernia sac \nappears medial to the fingers, it is direct. If the hernia appears only \nafter removing the pressure over the deep inguinal ring then it is \nindirect.\nImperfectly descended testis\nAn imperfectly descended testis may be in an ectopic position (root \nof the penis, upper thigh or perineum) or along the normal line \nof descent. An imperfectly descended testis cannot be felt in the \ninguinal canal – it is usually too flabby and atrophic and cannot be \npalpated through the tough overlying external oblique aponeurosis. \nHowever, should it become malignant then the hard and irregular \ntestis can be palpated in the inguinal canal. An imperfectly \ndescended testis may also be palpable in the upper thigh below the \ninguinal ligament. The scrotum will be empty on that side. The testis \ncannot descend more than a few centimetres into the upper thigh as \nits descent is prevented by the attachment of Scarpa’s fascia to the \ndeep fascia of the thigh below the inguinal ligament. An imperfectly \ndescended testis may also be palpable at the root of the penis or in \nthe perineum.\nLipoma of the cord\nThis can be confidently diagnosed only at surgery, although there \nwill not be an expansile cough impulse as with a hernia.\nHydrocele of the cord\nThis is rare. There will be a smooth, palpable swelling along the line \nof the cord. It does not have a palpable expansile cough impulse. If \ngentle traction is exerted on the testis, a hydrocele of the cord will \nbe felt to move down the canal. It may transilluminate.\nHydrocele of the canal of Nuck\nA swelling, similar to a hydrocele of the cord in the male, occurring \nin the female is called a hydrocele of the canal of Nuck. Findings will \nbe similar to those of a hydrocele of the cord in the male, except \nthere is nothing to exert traction on!\nFemoral hernia\nThis is more common in females. It lies below and lateral to the \npubic tubercle. There will be an expansile cough impulse. It may \nbe reducible. Strangulation of a femoral hernia is not uncommon, \nparticularly one of the Richter’s type. A tense, tender, irreducible \nswelling will be found below and lateral to the pubic tubercle.\nSUBASH KC/NMC-15TH/2014\n",

Classically \nthey are arranged into groups: (1) superficial, with subdivision \ninto horizontal and vertical groups; and (2) deep. In practice it is \ndifficult to distinguish between the groups. Lymph nodes in the \ngroin may be palpable as discrete nodules or they may be hard, \nirregular and matted together. This type is usually associated with \nmalignant disease. Tender, fluctuant lymph nodes with erythema \nof the overlying skin are usually associated with lymphadenopathy \ndue to an infective condition. It is important to examine all sites \nthat are drained by these nodes, namely: (1) the skin of the \nleg, including examination under the toe nails; (2) the skin of \nthe buttock; (3) the skin of the lower abdominal wall up to and \nincluding the umbilicus; (4) the skin of the scrotum, penis and \nglans penis; (5) the labia and lower third of the vagina; (6) the \nlower half of the anal canal; (7) the fundus of the uterus. It is \ntherefore necessary not only to examine superficial structures \nbut also to carry out a digital rectal examination and a bimanual \nvaginal examination.\nSaphena varix\nThis is a soft, compressible dilatation at the termination of \nthe saphenous vein. It has a cough impulse and disappears on \nrecumbency. A fluid thrill is felt if the veins lower down the leg \nare percussed.\nFemoral artery aneurysm\nA femoral artery aneurysm presents as an expansile pulsatile mass \nin the line of the femoral artery. Look for a scar in relationship to it, \nwhich may suggest a false aneurysm.\nImperfectly descended testis\nAn imperfectly descended testis may be palpable in the upper thigh \nbelow the inguinal ligament.

Painless haematuria is usually associated with tumour \nor TB. Total haematuria (throughout the stream) suggests bleeding \nfrom the upper urinary tract or bladder. Initial haematuria (at the \nstart of the stream) suggests bleeding from the urethra or the \nprostate.

There may be a history of TB elsewhere. \nHas there been any recent foreign travel (schistosomiasis)? Is there \nany pain in the loin to suggest kidney disease, or a history of \nureteric colic to suggest passage of a stone or clot down the ureter? \nBladder disease may be accompanied by suprapubic pain, frequency \nand dysuria.

With burns, scarring of the skin will be obvious.\nDupuytren’s contracture\nExamination will reveal a firm nodule in the palmar fascia near \nthe base of the ring finger. Puckering of the skin is usually present \naround the nodule. The MCP joint and the PIP joint are flexed, the \nDIP joint being extended. The ulnar digits (ring and little finger) are \nmost commonly affected.\nRheumatoid arthritis\nThere is thickening of the joints, especially the MCP joint and PIP \njoints. The joints become fusiform in shape. There is ulnar deviation \nof the fingers. The wrist joint develops a fixed flexion deformity with \nsome ulnar deviation. Swan-neck and boutonnière deformities of the \nfingers will be apparent. Ultimately, tendon rupture occurs and this \nleads to a variety of deformities.\nVolkmann’s ischaemic contracture\nThe skin of the hand is pale and the hand clawed and wasted. \nExtension of the fingers is limited but improves if the wrist is flexed. \nEventually, the forearm muscles feel hard and taut due to fibrosis.\nSpinal cord lesions\nIn the case of poliomyelitis, there is usually a clear history and the \nlimb usually looks reddish-blue, wasted and deformed. Syringomyelia \nmay cause a variety of hand deformities. With upper motor neurone \nlesions there may be fixed flexion of the wrist and fingers with \nadduction of the thumb.\nBrachial plexus injuries\nUpward traction on the arm may damage the lowest root (T1) of the \nbrachial plexus, which is the segmental supply of the intrinsic muscles \nof the hand. The hand becomes clawed (Klumpke’s paralysis). Check \nfor a possible associated Horner’s syndrome due to traction of the \ncervical sympathetic chain.\nPeripheral nerve lesions\nWith ulnar nerve lesions it is appropriate to check for damage to the \nmedial epicondyle. Also check for any evidence of recent lacerations \nat the wrist. With division at the wrist all the intrinsic muscles of the \nfingers (except for the radial two lumbricals – median nerve) are \nparalysed and the hand appears clawed.

Progressive severe headaches that develop over days or weeks \nshould lead to the consideration of raised intracranial pressure from \ntumour or chronic subdural haemorrhage. The onset of headache \nmay be preceded by an aura with migraine.\nSite\nClassically, headache from migraine is unilateral. Temporal arteritis \nleads to more localised pain over the superficial temporal arteries \nthat can be accompanied by jaw claudication. Ocular pain is \nexperienced with glaucoma, and retro-orbital pain with cluster \nheadaches.\nCharacter\nThe intensity of pain contributes little when discriminating between \nthe causes; however, the character of the pain may be useful. \nPatients with tension headache often complain of a tight band-\nlike sensation; this is in contrast to the pain experienced with raised \nintracranial pressure, which is often reported to have a bursting \nquality. Migraine-related and temporal arteritis headaches have a \nthrobbing character.\nPrecipitating factors\nHeadache originating from raised intracranial pressure is precipitated \nby changes in posture, coughing or sneezing, and is often worse in \nthe mornings. Photophobia may be experienced by patients suffering \nwith migraine, meningitis or glaucoma. They may prefer to lie in a \ndarkened room when headaches arise. Certain foods such as cheese, \nred wine and chocolate are known to precipitate migraine. It is \nvery common for headache to be precipitated by systemic illnesses \nsuch as a cold or influenza. Headache precipitated by touch occurs \nwith superficial temporal artery inflammation from temporal \narteritis. A drug history may elucidate the relationship between \nthe administration of drugs with headache as a side-effect, such as \nglyceryl trinitrate and nifedipine. Alternatively, headache can also \nresult from substance withdrawal in substance-dependent patients.\nAssociated symptoms\nNeck stiffness (meningism) is experienced with both meningitis \nand subarachnoid haemorrhages. Visual disturbances in the form \nof haloes occur with glaucoma. Flashing lights and alternations \nin perception of size may be reported by patients suffering with \nmigraine, and this may be accompanied by photophobia, nausea \nand vomiting. Transient neurological deficits may also occur. \nHowever, progressive neurology associated with headache is \nmore suggestive of an intracranial space-occupying lesion, such \nas haemorrhage, abscess and tumour. Unilateral visual loss may \nresult as a complication of temporal arteritis, and this may be \naccompanied by proximal muscle pain, stiffness and weakness \nSUBASH KC/NMC-15TH/2014\n",

Sudden onset hemiplegia is usually due \nto a cerebrovascular event such as a TIA, infarct or intracerebral \nhaemorrhage. Hemiplegia developing over minutes or hours \nafter trauma can be due to an evolving extradural or subdural \nhaemorrhage.

Gradual onset of \nhemiplegia is usually due to a tumour, although a cerebral abscess or \nchronic subdural haemorrhage may pursue a similar time course.\nPrecipitating factors\nA history of trauma may be evident with extradural and subdural \nhaemorrhages.

Unfortunately, the precipitating factor \nfor the seizure may be underlying structural abnormalities such as a \ncerebral abscess or tumour.\nAssociated symptoms\nOwing to the multifocal nature of demyelination, patients with \nmultiple sclerosis may present with a host of associated symptoms, \nsuch as areas of motor deficits, sensory deficits, diplopia and \nmonocular blindness from optic neuritis. Space-occupying lesions \nsuch as extradural haematoma, brain tumour and cerebral abscesses \nmay also present with symptoms of raised intracranial pressure, such \nas headaches, classically worse in the morning, and with coughing or \nsneezing, nausea, vomiting and drowsiness.\nEXAMINATION\nThe neurological examination is the key to determining the location \nof the lesion. Cortical lesions impinging on the motor area of the \nfrontal lobe produce total contralateral paralysis. Similar effects can \nresult from lesions of the internal capsule. Midbrain lesions tend to \nproduce ipsilateral neurological deficits of the face and contralateral \ndeficits of the limbs. Multifocal neurological deficits may be \nproduced by demyelination or cerebral metastasis.\nAfter determining the site of the lesion, the examination should \nbe continued to determine the cause. Pyrexia should alert the \nclinician to the presence of infection, which may be caused by a \ncerebral abscess. The presence of facial myokymia, which is rippling \nof the muscles on one side of the face, is reported to be very \nsuggestive of multiple sclerosis; cervical involvement may produce \nLhermitte’s sign, which is paraesthesia of the hands and feet on \nflexion of the neck.\nExamination of the ear, mastoid and sinuses is useful to locate the \nsite of primary infection, which may give rise to a cerebral abscess. \nDistant sites of infection that may precipitate cerebral abscesses are \nthe lungs and emboli from infective endocarditis. The fingers are \nexamined for nailfold infarcts with endocarditis and the precordium \nis auscultated for new or changing murmurs.

Amoebiasis occurs worldwide, and hepatitis B is prevalent in the \ntropics and Mediterranean areas. Hydatid disease is more common in \nsheep-rearing countries, e.g. Australia, Africa, Wales. Leptospirosis can \nresult from swimming in rat-infested waters. History of alcohol abuse \npredisposes to alcoholic cirrhosis. Chronic active hepatitis should be \nconsidered with a history of alcohol, hepatitis B or hepatitis C. In the \nmajority of hepatitis/infection cases, the patient presents with general \nmalaise, pyrexia, weight loss and jaundice.\nCongestion\nHistory of congestive cardiac failure, may be evident and the \npatient often complains of upper abdominal pain caused by a \ntender liver due to stretching of the liver capsule. With constrictive \npericarditis there is often a history of TB but it may follow any \ncause of pericarditis, e.g. acute renal failure. Budd–Chiari syndrome \nis hepatic vein thrombosis. A history of taking the contraceptive \npill may be contributory. Tumour may also cause Budd–Chiari \nsyndrome. It presents insidiously with portal hypertension, jaundice \nand cirrhosis.\nInfiltration\nThere is usually a history of alcohol abuse with fatty infiltration. \nSecondary amyloidosis follows chronic infection, e.g. rheumatoid \narthritis, bronchiectasis, inflammatory bowel disease.\nBiliary tract disease\nThere may be a history of biliary tract obstruction, e.g. carcinoma \nof the pancreas or stricture of the common bile duct. Sclerosing \ncholangitis causes jaundice and fevers and is associated with \ninflammatory bowel disease. Primary biliary cirrhosis is of unknown \naetiology. Some 90% of the patients are female. It presents with \nobstructive jaundice, pruritus and hepatosplenomegaly. The patient \nwill complain of dark urine and pale stools.\nMalignancy\nThe chief cause is metastases from a known malignancy, which \nmay have been treated, e.g. gastrointestinal tract or bronchus. \nSUBASH KC/NMC-15TH/2014\n",

Following pneumonia or thoracic surgery, chronic \npyrexia and pleuritic chest pains with failure of resolution of \nsymptoms of the original infection may herald the onset of an \nempyema. Hiccups may (rarely) complicate routine thoracic surgery. \nWhen a chronic cough is associated with haemoptysis and weight \nloss in a smoker, bronchial tumour is the most likely diagnosis.\nAbdominal history\nSymptoms of rapid progressive painless dysphagia (p. 105) may be \ndue to oesophageal carcinoma. At birth, a diaphragmatic hernia \nmay present with respiratory distress; adults with diaphragmatic \nhernias may, however, be completely asymptomatic, the hernia being \ndetected incidentally on a chest X-ray. Unremitting pyrexia and \nmalaise in patients after abdominal surgery, or following localised \ninflammatory conditions such as appendicitis and cholecystitis, may \nhave developed an intra-abdominal abscess. The subphrenic region \nis the most common site of a collection of pus. This is associated with \nintractable hiccups and pain referred to the shoulder, scapula or \nneck. A pleural effusion may be an accompanying feature.\nNeurological history\nPyrexia, headache, photophobia and neck stiffness are associated \nwith meningitis. Patients with encephalitis tend to present with \nconfusion, alterations in consciousness and seizures. The brainstem \nis a very anatomically complex structure, therefore symptoms of \ninfarction or tumour may be very variable, depending on distribution \nof involvement of the lower cranial nerves. The presenting features \nmay be diplopia, difficulty swallowing, dysarthria and facial sensory \nloss.

The \nprincipal differentiating feature between infarction and tumour is \nthe speed of onset; in general, stroke presents suddenly and tumours \nprogressively.\nOthers\nAmelioration of hiccups by sleep, bizarre accompanying symptoms \nand inconsistencies in the history are suggestive of hysterical hiccups. \nUraemia may be responsible for hiccups.\nEXAMINATION\nA substantial number of causes of intractable hiccups are associated \nwith pyrexia. High swinging fevers are suggestive of collections of \npus, such as empyema and subphrenic abscesses.\nAn abdominal examination should be performed.

Fracture of the \nmandible is the most common.\nInfective\nDental abscess presents with a dull ache in the jaw, becoming \nthrobbing and severe. There is often accompanying malaise and loss \nof appetite. Previous history of dental caries. Acute osteomyelitis \nof the mandible is rare. It may follow dental infection or tooth \nextraction. There may be a history of fractures, irradiation, \nleukaemia, diabetes, malnutrition, alcoholism or immunosuppression. \nThere is a severe, throbbing deep-seated pain. The patient has \ndifficulty opening the mouth and swallowing due to muscle oedema. \nActinomycosis presents with swelling of the jaw with persistent low-\ngrade infection.\nTemporomandibular joint\nTemporomandibular joint pain dysfunction syndrome results from \ngrinding and clenching the teeth. The patient may have had a stress-\nrelated illness. Pain arises in the region of the temporomandibular \njoint or ear, which may be associated with a clicking noise and is \naggravated by wide opening of the mouth, as with yawning and \nchewing. Rheumatoid arthritis of the temporomandibular joint is \nrare. Other signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis are usually \napparent. Osteoarthritis usually causes pain, swelling and limitation \nof jaw movement. Temporomandibular joint dislocation may be \nrecurrent, habitual or isolated. The condyle is displaced forwards and \nupwards into the temporal fossa. The patient’s mouth remains open \nand cannot be closed following yawning, tooth extraction or general \nanaesthesia. The condition may be unilateral or bilateral. The patient \npresents with an open mouth, which he or she cannot close, and pain \ndue to muscle spasm.\nCystic\nCysts often present as asymptomatic lucencies on radiographs. \nOtherwise they present as painless swellings, which may reach a \nlarge size. If the cyst becomes infected the patient presents with \npain, swelling and discharge. Occasionally pathological fractures \noccur. A dental cyst is attached to the root of a normally erupted but \ndecayed tooth; the swelling grows slowly. Dentigerous cysts contain \nan unerupted tooth.\nNeoplastic\nThe patient presents with a jaw swelling which grows steadily and \noften painlessly.

Initially it is painless but becomes painful \nas it grows. Teeth may be loosened. The patient may complain of \nparaesthesia due to involvement of the mental nerve. Coughing may \nbe a symptom if lung metastases have occurred. Burkitt’s tumour is \nassociated with EBV. It is a malignant tumour of B lymphocytes. It is \nendemic in certain parts of Africa and New Guinea. It affects most \ncommonly children below the age of 12 years. The child presents \nwith a progressive painless swelling of the jaw.

The patient \npresents in pain supporting the arm, which is abducted. Anterior \ndislocation is the most common but posterior dislocation is often \nmissed and can occur after trauma such as fits or electric shocks. With \ndislocation of the acromioclavicular joint there is usually a history \nof a fall on the shoulder (common in rugby players). Fracture of \nthe surgical neck of the humerus occurs with a fall on the shoulder. \nThe patient presents with pain, deformity and inability to move \nthe shoulder. Clavicular fracture is usually caused by a fall on the \noutstretched hand or point of the shoulder. Scapular fractures are \nusually high-energy injuries often due to RTAs.\nDegenerative\nSupraspinatus tendinosis results from degeneration, inflammation \nor calcification of the tendon. There may be sudden pain or there \nmay be just a painful arc at the initiation of movement. With \nimpingement syndromes the rotator cuff becomes compressed \nunder the acromion, or acromioclavicular joint, resulting in pain on \nabducting the arm. A painful arc suggests subacromial pathology. \nRotator cuff tears often occur in older patients and probably \nrelate to degeneration of the cuff. In the younger, fit patient, the \nrotator cuff tear may be due to violent trauma with rupture of \nsupraspinatus. The patient is unable to initiate abduction of the \narm but passive movement is normal. Frozen shoulder (adhesive \ncapsulitis) usually affects the middle-aged and there may be a \nhistory of minor injury. There is pain and limitation of both active \nand passive movement of the shoulder. The pain is often severe and \ndisturbs sleep. It may occur in the elderly following immobilisation \nof the arm, e.g. following a Colles’ fracture or stroke. It is more \ncommon in diabetics. Osteoarthritis of the acromioclavicular joint \npresents as pain associated with overhead movement and a high \npainful arc (>140°). Osteoarthritis of the glenohumeral joint may be \nidiopathic or follow avascular necrosis, or radionecrosis following \nradiotherapy for carcinoma of the breast. The patient complains of \npain on shoulder movement and night pain.\nInflammatory\nRheumatoid arthritis is more common than osteoarthritis in the \nshoulder joint.

Pulled elbow occurs in children aged 2–6 years. The \nradial head slips out of the annular ligament. The child may have \nbeen ‘swinging’ with the parents holding the hands. Fractures of \nthe olecranon may result as a fall on the point of the elbow or \nby sudden contraction of the triceps. Condylar and epicondylar \nfractures are rare and easily missed. With myositis ossificans there \nwill be a history of a supracondylar fracture or dislocation of the \nelbow. A calcified haematoma forms in front of the joint. Movement \nof the joint, especially flexion, is affected. It may follow ill-advised \nphysiotherapy with passive stretching of the joints after trauma or \nafter surgery.\nDegenerative\nOsteoarthritis of the elbow may occur in heavy manual workers or \nfollowing complicated fractures involving the joint. Osteochondritis \ndissecans may cause elbow pain and restrict movement because of a \nloose body in the joint.\nInflammatory\nRheumatoid arthritis may affect the elbow joint. There will \nusually be signs of rheumatoid arthritis elsewhere. If there is gross \ndisorganisation of the joint with deformity, the ulnar nerve may be \ninvolved and there may be symptoms of ulnar nerve palsy. Gout may \naffect the elbow joint.\nNeurological\nVarious nerve entrapment syndromes can occur around the elbow. \nSymptoms may present in the distribution of ulnar, median or \nposterior interosseous nerves.\nOther\nOlecranon bursitis results in painful or painless swelling over the \nolecranon. It is common in carpet layers and students (students rest \ntheir heads in their hands while studying late into the night with \ntheir elbows resting on the desk). The bursa may become infected \nwith a red, tender, hot swelling. Tennis elbow is common between \nthe ages of 30 and 50 years. It presents with pain on the lateral side \nof the elbow. It affects tennis players and anyone whose job involves \nextending and twisting the forearm. The pain is often worse on \ngripping. Golfer’s elbow is similar to tennis elbow but affects the \nmedial epicondyle. The patient complains of pain and tenderness \nover the medial epicondyle and also of pain on hyperextending the \nfingers and wrists. Cubitus valgus/varus may follow fractures around \nthe elbow in childhood. Cubitus valgus may progressively stretch the \nulnar nerve, with a slowly developing ulnar nerve palsy.\nSUBASH KC/NMC-15TH/2014\n",

With dislocation the patient is usually \nshocked with other injuries. With posterior dislocation the thigh \nis flexed, adducted and internally rotated. Check for sciatic nerve \ninjury. There may be associated injury to femur or patella. With \nisolated fractures of the pubic ramus there may be little to find on \nexamination, although a second fracture/joint injury is common at \nthe back of the pelvic ring.\nInfective\nAcute pyogenic arthritis presents with a hot, tender, painful swollen \nhip. All movements are painful. There is spasm in the surrounding \nmuscles. The patient usually has a high fever. TB presents with \nlocal tenderness, swelling and effusion. There is muscle wasting \nand spasm. There is usually a constitutional upset with malaise and \nfever.\nInflammatory\nWith reactive/Reiter’s disease there is usually associated urethritis \nand conjunctivitis. With rheumatoid arthritis other joints are usually \ninvolved and the patient may describe constitutional symptoms. The \nhip is often held in flexion and movements are painful. Ankylosing \nspondylitis usually presents with a stiff spine with a limited range of \nmovement, although the hips may also be stiff.\nDegenerative\nOsteoarthritis usually presents with a limp. The leg lies externally \nrotated and appears shortened because of fixed adduction. There \nis usually a degree of fixed flexion. Restriction in movement \noccurs: abduction, extension and internal rotation loss occurring \nearly and being most restricted. There is apparent shortening. \nAvascular necrosis results in distortion of joint shape with \nstiffness, limitation of movement and ultimately secondary \nosteoarthritis.\nNeoplastic\nCheck for localised pain over the hip joint. Check for any tumour \nof breast, bronchus, thyroid, prostate or kidney. In children with \nleukaemic infiltration there may be other signs, e.g. spontaneous \nbruising, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly.\nOther\nTransient synovitis presents with a limp. There is no systemic upset. \nThere is limitation of movement at the joint. Perthes’ disease \npresents with a limp and a decreased range of joint movement. With \nslipped upper femoral epiphysis the leg lies in external rotation and \npassive internal rotation is diminished. Limitation of movement due \nto pain is usually present in transient osteoporosis of the hip.\nSUBASH KC/NMC-15TH/2014\n",

The patient \nwill notice a lump and reduced flexion of the knee. There may also \nbe pain associated with concurrent osteoarthritis of the joint.\nDisorders of alignment\nWith genu varum the patient presents with bow legs. In children, this \nis usually associated with a disorder of growth, often with a bony \ninjury to the area of epiphyses.

The patient may also complain \nof backache with painful spasm in the back muscles. There are \nrestricted movements of the spine. Neurogenic claudication results \nfrom central spinal canal stenosis. Symptoms improve with flexion as \nthis increases the diameter of the canal. Therefore, patients find it \neasier to cycle than walk and easier to walk upstairs than downstairs. \nWith neurogenic claudication, the claudication distance becomes \nprogressively shorter with each bout of pain during one walk but \nnot with vascular claudication. It also takes the pain of neurogenic \nclaudication longer to settle than the pain of vascular claudication. \nThe two forms of claudication may co-exist, making diagnosis difficult.\nMetabolic\nGout presents as acute severe pain with redness and swelling of a \njoint.

With cellulitis the limb will be red, swollen, hot and \ntender. A puncture wound may be visible. DVT may be suspected if \nthe limb is tender and swollen, particularly the calf with a positive \nHomans’ sign, i.e. pain in the calf on dorsiflexion of the foot. \nTenderness may be present over the femoral vein with femoral \nvein thrombosis.

Swelling and tenderness over the \njoints may suggest rheumatoid arthritis. Lymphoedema pits in the \nearly stages but in the later stage it becomes non-pitting, when \nthe skin and subcutaneous tissue become thick and eventually \nhyperkeratotic and warty.

      "text": "300\nLip Lesions\nHISTORY\nCongenital\nCleft lip occurs due to failure of fusion of the nasal and maxillary \nprocesses which form the upper lip and the maxilla. The only \nabnormality may be a slight indentation in the outer part of \nthe middle third of the upper lip. However, it may extend to \nthe anterior nares. It may be associated with a cleft palate. The \ncondition may be unilateral or bilateral. Abnormal phonation \noccurs.\nAcquired\nFlat lesions\nJunctional naevi develop at or before puberty. Ensure that \nthere has been no change in a junctional naevus to suggest \ndevelopment of malignant melanoma. In Peutz–Jeghers \nsyndrome pigmentation will be on the gums as well as the lips. \nThere will usually be a family history (autosomal dominant). \nThese pigmented lip lesions do not become malignant. There \nmay be associated history of bowel problems, e.g. bleeding or \nintussusception. In hereditary telangiectasia, the patient may also \nhave noticed lesions in the mouth and on the skin, especially the \nfingertips.\nRaised lesions\nMucous retention cysts may occur at any age. The patient \ncomplains of a lump on the inner aspect of the lip which interferes \nwith eating. With warts, pyogenic granuloma and squamous cell \ncarcinoma, the patient’s only complaint is usually of a lump on the \nlip. With carcinoma, there may be a history of leucoplakia, betel-\nnut chewing or pipe smoking. Classically it used to relate to clay-\npipe smoking. There may also be a history of exposure to sunlight, \nand carcinoma is common in outdoor workers, e.g. sailors, farmers, \nfisherman and fair-skinned people in sunny climates. Ulcerating \nand bleeding of the lesion may be a presenting complaint. \nSyphilitic lesions are now extremely rare. A primary chancre may \npresent on the lip. They are highly contagious. A gummatous \nlesion on the lip is extremely rare. Malignant melanoma may \npresent as a black, ulcerating or raised lesion at the site of a \njunctional naevus.\nErosions\nThe commonest are herpes simplex lesions. Small painful \nulcers, which itch, may present on the lips. They are common in \nimmunocompromised patients. Impetigo is common around the \nmouth and face of children but may affect any age. Pemphigus is a \nblistering disorder which affects the mucosa and skin.\nSUBASH KC/NMC-15TH/2014\n",

Trauma is \nprobably the most common, usually following assault, but may arise \nas a result of burns (hot fluids), sun rays or angioneurotic oedema, \nwhich is rare and may affect the tongue and other parts of the body. \nDrug reactions may cause oedema when associated with urticaria. \nThey usually affect the whole face rather than just the lips. Crohn’s \ndisease may also cause swelling of the lips. Other symptoms and signs \nof Crohn’s disease, e.g. diarrhoea, abdominal pain or perianal sepsis, \nmay be present.\nCheilitis\nThis usually refers to inflammation of the lips and may occur at the \nangles of the mouth, i.e. angular cheilitis or angular stomatitis. \nContact dermatitis may be apparent from either lipstick or pen-\nsucking. A history of lip-licking should be sought, especially in \nchildren. Candida may cause cheilitis in the immunocompromised, \ninfants, those with dentures, and those with iron-deficiency anaemia.\nEXAMINATION\nCongenital\nCleft lip is obvious at birth. Cleft palate is discovered on routine \ninspection soon after birth or may be discovered when difficulties \noccur with feeding. Beware missing a submucous cleft in which the \npalate initially appears intact. Late presentation may occur with \nspeech and hearing difficulties.\nAcquired\nFlat lesions\nJunctional naevi are flat, pigmented lesions. The lesions of Peutz–\nJeghers syndrome are also flat lesions but, in addition to occurring \non the lips, occur also on the gums. In hereditary telangiectasia, \ntelangiectasia may also be present in the mouth, on the palate and \non the skin, especially the fingertips.\nRaised lesions\nMucous retention cysts tend to occur on the inner aspects of the \nlips. They are generally pale pink with a grey glairy appearance \nwhen the cyst contents show through the stretched overlying \nmucosa. They are usually smooth, well localised and rarely get \nbigger than 2  cm in diameter. A warty lesion is usually obvious, \nwith a rough hyperkeratotic surface. Warts may be pedunculated. \nA pyogenic granuloma is a firm, small, cherry-red nodule consisting \nof hyperplastic granulation tissue. A squamous cell carcinoma is \nusually a hard ulcerated lesion with a raised everted edge. The \nregional lymph nodes may be palpable due to metastases. Malignant \nSUBASH KC/NMC-15TH/2014\n",

Impetigo \ncauses golden-coloured crusts, usually on the faces of children.

      "text": "319\nMuscle Weakness And Wasting\nSection A\nHISTORY\nOnset\nMuscle weakness and wasting in childhood is often due to congenital \ndisease such as inherited muscular dystrophies (e.g. Duchenne’s \nmuscular dystrophy), a diagnosis further supported by a positive family \nhistory of a first-degree relative with similar problems. With myotonic \ndystrophy, first symptoms occur around the age of 15–30 years, while \nwith motor neurone disease the peak age of onset is in the 50s.\nSite\nThe distribution of muscle wasting may characterise the disease. \nAtrophy may be confined to the motor supply of a single nerve, such \nas the thenar eminence with the median nerve affected by carpal \ntunnel syndrome. It may also occur with a group of muscles such as \nthe leg with polio. And finally the distribution may be generalised in \nconditions such as motor neurone disease. Distal weakness ascending \nto involve proximal muscles is characteristic of Guillain–Barré \nsyndrome.\nPrecipitating factors\nPrecipitating factors such as trauma may result in transection of a \nperipheral nerve such as the ulnar nerve, commonly at the wrist.\nPast medical history\nThe presence of carcinoma or chronic cardiorespiratory disease \nmay give rise to peripheral muscle wasting from cachexia. Previous \ninfection with polio is significant because, in a minority of affected \nindividuals, degeneration of anterior horn cells with subsequent \nparalysis and muscle wasting occurs (post-polio syndrome). Disuse \natrophy can be localised or generalised. Conditions that result in \nimmobility such as a long-bone fracture will cause disuse atrophy \nof the surrounding muscles; this is commonly seen upon removal of \nplaster casts. Localised disuse atrophy may also result from joint pains \nsuch as quadriceps wasting with painful knee disorders. Prolonged \nimmobility will result in generalised muscle wasting. Conditions such \nas diabetes and renal failure are associated with neuropathy. Poor \ndiet and lack of sun exposure may lead to vitamin D deficiency.\nAssociated symptoms\nMost of the causes are associated with weakness of the affected \nmuscles. Diplopia, ptosis and fatiguability are associated features \nsuggestive of myasthenia gravis. Motor neurone disease may \npresent with progressive weakness and wasting of the hand or leg \naccompanied with dysarthria and dysphasia. Cushing’s disease may \nbe associated with weight gain, hair growth, acne, abdominal striae, \nmuscle weakness, back pain and depression.\nSUBASH KC/NMC-15TH/2014\n",

Generalised uniform \nmuscle wasting should lead to a careful examination of the organ \nsystems for malignancy and organ failure. Muscle tenderness may \noccur with polymyositis.\nCharacteristic features of myotonic dystrophy are frontal balding, \nptosis, temporal and facial muscle wasting. Cataracts may be \nseen with inspection of the eyes. Ptosis may also be a feature of \nmyasthenia gravis; this is accompanied by diplopia, facial weakness \nand a weak nasal voice. Muscle wasting with fasciculations occurs \nwith motor neurone disease, no sensory loss is experienced and \nmixed upper and lower motor neurone signs may be present.\nAssessment of tone, reflexes and pattern of weakness will \ndetermine whether it is an upper or lower motor neurone lesion. \nDelayed relaxation of muscle contraction occurs with myotonic \ndystrophy and proximal muscle weakness occurs with Cushing’s \ndisease. With localised muscle wasting, examination of each muscle \nwill allow you to determine whether the lesion arises from a single \nnerve or a nerve root. Weakness, areflexia and sensory loss is seen \nwith Guillain–Barré syndrome.\nThe joint surrounded by wasted muscles should be examined for \ndeformity or pain that may restrict movement.

Angio-oedema may be \nprecipitated by a known allergen. Lymphoedema may result as a \ncomplication of infection with filarial nematodes while travelling \nin endemic areas such as Africa, Asia and Australia.

It may also follow \ninsults similar to those that cause acute tubular necrosis. Vascular \nlesions may also lead to acute renal failure; these include renal \nvein thrombosis, renal artery stenosis and intravascular coagulation \noccurring in haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Other forms of \nacute renal failure usually present with swelling of the eyelids, \nascites and peripheral oedema. Later there may be vomiting, \nconfusion, bruising, gastrointestinal bleeding and eventually \nfitting and coma. Volume overload may result in pulmonary \noedema. With acute interstitial nephritis, there may be a history \nof drug ingestion, e.g. antibiotics, NSAIDs or diuretics, or there \nmay be a history of infection. Nephrotoxins may cause acute renal \nfailure and among the drugs implicated are the aminoglycosides, \namphotericin and radiographic contrast media. Organic solvents, \nparticularly carbon tetrachloride used in carpet cleaning, may be \nresponsible. Paraquat, snake bites and mushrooms may also cause \nacute renal failure.\nPost-renal\nOften the patient will present with complete anuria. This may \noccur if there is ureteric damage following surgery or a stone \nimpacted in the ureter of a solitary functioning kidney. The patient \nmay have a history of calculous disease or may have recently \nsuffered an attack of ureteric colic. There may be a history of \npelvic tumour or symptoms of prostatic hypertrophy, e.g. difficulty \nin starting and a poor stream. Retroperitoneal fibrosis often \ndevelops insidiously.\nOthers\nOliguria may follow a mismatched transfusion, due to haemoglobinuria, \nor crush injuries, due to myoglobinuria. The history will usually be \nobvious.\nAnuria\nBefore diagnosing anuria, make sure that the patient does not \nhave a palpable bladder (if he or she is not catheterised) and is not \ntherefore in acute retention, or, if the patient is catheterised, that \nthe catheter is not blocked. As indicated above, anuria is more likely \nto be a symptom of an obstructive lesion rather than one of renal \nhypoperfusion or an intrinsic renal lesion.\nEXAMINATION\nGeneral\nIf the patient has a catheter in situ, make sure that it is not blocked. \nIf the patient does not have a catheter in situ, palpate the lower \nabdomen for a distended bladder associated with acute retention. \nSUBASH KC/NMC-15TH/2014\n",

Symptoms \nmay also be experienced in the neck. Important aspects are the \nfrequency, regularity of palpitation (e.g. fast and irregular) and \nprecipitating factors.

Palpitations can \nbe a normal manifestation of anxiety or panic reactions. However, it \nis vitally important that an organic cause is excluded as it is common \nfor anxiety disorders to co-exist in a patient with supraventricular \ntachycardia.

It is very unlikely that any \narrhythmia can be picked up during this investigation; however, \nconditions that predispose to arrhythmia may be diagnosed.

Teeth marks may \nbe apparent.\nCarcinoma\nThe lesion is usually at the junction of the foreskin and glans. There \nwill be a lump or ulcer. If there is an ulcer it will have raised everted \nedges and a necrotic base. It feels hard. The inguinal lymph nodes \nmay be affected, either by metastases or by secondary infection. \nIn patients in whom the foreskin cannot be retracted, it may be \nnecessary to carry out circumcision to make the diagnosis.\nErythroplasia of Queyrat\nThere is a dark-red, flat, velvety, indurated patch on the glans penis. \nIt is a premalignant condition and represents carcinoma in situ.\nSyphilitic chancre\nThere will be a painless, hard ulcer with a sloping edge. The inguinal \nnodes will be enlarged, rubbery, discrete and non-tender.\nShaft\nPeyronie’s disease\nThere are plaques of fibrosis in the corpora cavernosa. These may \nbe felt as hard lumps along the corpora cavernosa. The patient will \nvolunteer the information that the penis becomes bent on erection.\nPriapism\nThe diagnosis will be obvious, there being a painful erection.\nUrethra\nThe diagnosis of epispadias and hypospadias will be obvious. In \nhypospadias the opening of the urethra may be anywhere along the \nline of the urethra, from a few millimetres from the tip of the penis \nto the perineum. In epispadias, which is rare, the urethral opening is \non the dorsal surface of the glans penis.\nGENERAL INVESTIGATIONS\n■\n■\nFBC, ESR\nWCC  infection, leukaemia (associated with priapism).

Frequency of \nmicturition (frequent passing of small amounts of urine) should be \ndifferentiated from polyuria (frequent passing of large amounts \nof urine). Diabetes insipidus may be hereditary and other family \nmembers may be affected.\nDrug history\nA detailed drug history is invaluable, as a significant number of drugs \nprecipitate polyuria by various mechanisms. Therapeutic diuretics \nare used in a range of disorders, such as hypertension and cardiac \nfailure. Opiates inhibit ADH secretion and may produce cranial \ndiabetes insipidus, whereas drugs such as lithium and demeclocycline \nmay produce nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. A side-effect of \nanticholinergics is dryness of the mouth; patients may therefore \ningest excessive quantities of water, causing polyuria. Nephrotoxic \ndrugs, such as aminoglycosides, ciclosporin, NSAIDs and ACE \ninhibitors, may precipitate acute tubular necrosis, which can result in \nsevere polyuria in the recovery phase.\nPast medical history\nHyperglycaemia causes an osmotic diuresis, therefore polyuria and \npolydipsia are common presenting features of diabetes mellitus. \nMalignancy and hyperparathyroidism are common causes of chronic \nhypercalcaemia, which can cause polyuria by an intrinsic osmotic \neffect or by precipitation of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Cranial \ndiabetes insipidus can result from severe, blunt, head injuries, \ncraniopharyngiomas, pineal gland tumours or as a transient post-\noperative complication following neurosurgery. Renal ischaemia \nfrom conditions such as sepsis and haemorrhage predisposes to acute \ntubular necrosis. Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis can result from \nreflux nephropathy, polycystic kidney disease, gout and multiple \nmyeloma.\nGENERAL INVESTIGATIONS\n■\n■\nUrine dipstick\n+++ glucose with diabetes mellitus.\nSUBASH KC/NMC-15TH/2014\n",

It may also occur \nas a side-effect of alcohol or drug withdrawal. Pruritus after a hot \nbath classically occurs with polycythaemia. Iron deficiency, even in \nthe absence of anaemia, can cause pruritus; therefore symptoms of \nblood loss in each system should be carefully elicited.\nHaemoptysis, chronic cough and weight loss in smokers may \nbe due to underlying bronchial carcinoma, which is an important \nsubgroup of internal malignancies that present with pruritus. The \npresence of localised lymphadenopathy, fever, night sweats and \nweight loss should lead to the consideration of Hodgkin’s disease. \nPatients with obstructive jaundice (p. 240) may present with pruritus \nSUBASH KC/NMC-15TH/2014\n",

In men, this may be \nassociated with balanitis xerotica obliterans, so enquire if there is any \nabnormality of the foreskin.\nParasites\nThreadworms usually occur in children. The parents may have \nnoticed them.\nPsychogenic\nIdiopathic pruritus may occur in people with anxiety states. An itch–\nscratch cycle may occur, which is difficult to break.\nEXAMINATION\nAnal discharge\nInspection of the anus may show skin tags, the external opening \nof a fistula-in-ano, perianal warts or haemorrhoids. Digital rectal \nexamination may reveal a carcinoma of the anal canal or fibrous anal \npolyps. Proctoscopy and sigmoidoscopy will confirm any associated \nanal or rectal lesion. Take a swab if purulent discharge.\nFaecal soiling\nSoiling of the underwear may be apparent. General poor hygiene \nmay be apparent also in the patient. Carry out a digital rectal \nexamination to check for sphincteric tone.\nSkin diseases\nCandidiasis may occur in those on long-term antibiotics, diabetics \nand the immunosuppressed. Tinea cruris is more common in men. \nSUBASH KC/NMC-15TH/2014\n",

The cause of many rashes can be diagnosed on clinical \ninspection of the rash alone. The morphology of a rash is therefore \nimportant. Morphological terms include:\n■\n■\nMacule – a non-raised, usually well-demarcated, coloured area of skin.\n■\n■\nPapule – a raised, usually round, well-demarcated lesion <5 mm in diameter. \nIt varies in colour and may become nodular, undergo transformation into a \nvesicle or ulcerate.\n■\n■\nNodule – similar to a papule but is >5 mm in diameter.\n■\n■\nBlister – a lesion in the skin containing free fluid. Those <5 mm in diameter \nare termed vesicles; those >5 mm are termed bullae.\n■\n■\nPustule – a pus-containing raised lesion <5 mm in diameter.\n■\n■\nPurpura – purpura describes areas of bleeding into the skin >2 mm in \ndiameter. Petechiae are <2 mm in diameter and ecchymoses are >4 mm in \ndiameter. They do not blanch with pressure.\n■\n■\nErythema – a persistent reddening of the skin due to dilatation of \nsuperficial capillaries.

Is there a history of exposure to the \nsun? Is there any history of any allergies or exposures to irritants or \ncosmetics? Check carefully for diabetes or immunosuppression which \nmight suggest a fungal infection.\nEXAMINATION\nThe patient should be examined in good light using the naked eye \ninitially and then a magnifying glass (or dermatoscope) to inspect \nthe rash. Ascertain the distribution of the rash. Symmetrical rashes \nsuggest an endogenous cause, e.g. viral; asymmetrical rashes suggest \nan exogenous cause, e.g. local skin irritants, nappy rash. Note the \nmorphology of the rash, i.e. macular, papular, red and scaly.

Bleeding from piles is noted either on \nthe toilet paper or as splashes in the toilet after defecation. \nUncomplicated piles are not painful.\nFissure-in-ano\nFissure-in-ano is most common under the age of 40 years. It is quite \ncommon in children. The patient experiences pain on defecation, \nwhich may persist for minutes or hours afterwards. Constipation is \nusually a precipitating cause, the constipation being made worse by \nthe fissure as the patient avoids defecation because of pain. Blood is \nnoticed on the toilet paper or streaked on the stool.\nCarcinoma of the anal canal\nCarcinoma of the anal canal usually occurs in the elderly. It presents \nwith pain on defecation and streaking of blood on the stools and \nblood on the toilet paper. Initially, in the early stages, it may be \nmistaken for a fissure-in-ano.\nTrauma\nThere may be a history of a penetrating injury to the anal canal. \nSexual abuse or homosexual practices may be relevant.\nColorectal\nCarcinoma\nWith colonic carcinoma the blood may be mixed with the stool. \nThere is usually a history of accompanying change in bowel habit \nand colicky abdominal pain. With rectal cancer the blood is usually \nstreaked on the stool and there may be a history of tenesmus, i.e. a \nsense of incomplete evacuation of the rectum.\nPolyps\nThe history may be similar to that of carcinoma.\nDiverticular disease\nBleeding associated with diverticular disease is typically acute, \nmassive and fresh. There may be a past history of diverticular disease.\nInflammatory bowel disease\nWith ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease there is often sudden \nonset of diarrhoea with watery, brown motions containing mucus \nand fresh blood. There is usually colicky abdominal pain. With \nulcerative proctitis the patient may complain of tenesmus.\nSUBASH KC/NMC-15TH/2014\n",

It may become very large.  \nA hydrocele is fluctuant, transilluminates and is dull to percussion. \nIf large enough there may be a fluid thrill. The testis cannot be \npalpated separately from the hydrocele. It is possible to get above \nthe swelling except with infantile hydroceles, when the fluid extends \nup to the deep inguinal ring.\nEpididymal cyst\nAn epididymal cyst usually occurs above and behind the testis. \nThe testis can be palpated separately from it.

In the absence of trauma, the presence of chest pain should \nlead you to consider myocardial infarction (central crushing) and \npulmonary embolism (pleuritic).\nPrecipitating factors\nOccasionally patients may be aware of allergens that provoke \nanaphylaxis.

In hospital, \npenicillin, anaesthetic agents and intravenous contrast media are the \nmajor provoking factors. Detailed systemic enquiry for presence of \ninfection may elucidate the offending focus for patients in septic shock. \nA history of profuse vomiting, diarrhoea or intestinal obstruction \n(vomiting, constipation, colicky abdominal pain and distension) would \nindicate gastrointestinal losses as the cause for hypovolaemia.\nEXAMINATION\nInspection\nA thorough systematic inspection should be undertaken; burns and \nsites of bleeding from penetrating trauma may be obvious.

The causes are listed below, according to pathogenesis.\nCAUSES\nLIPASE DEFICIENCY\n• Impaired secretion – chronic pancreatitis\n• Inactivation – excess gastric acid\nBILE DEFICIENCY\n• Underproduction – liver disease\n• Obstruction – obstructive jaundice\n• Increased degradation – bacterial overgrowth\nMUCOSAL DISEASE\n• Coeliac disease\n• Ileal resection\n• Crohn’s disease\nIMPAIRED FAT TRANSPORT\n• Abetalipoproteinaemia\nLYMPHATIC DEFICIENCY\n• Lymphoma\n• Whipple’s disease\nHISTORY\nPatients with steatorrhoea often pass bulky, sticky and greasy stool \nthat floats and is often difficult to flush away. Diarrhoea is the usual \naccompanying symptom (p. 97) for most of the causes. Jaundice with \npale stools and dark urine implies obstruction to the flow of bile, \nwhich is essential for the absorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins. \nThe causes and diagnostic approach to jaundice \nare found on p. 240.\nAbdominal pain\nVague epigastric abdominal pain experienced by patients with \nchronic pancreatitis may radiate to the back and is usually worse \nwith food. Epigastric pain exacerbated by food may be a symptom \nof Zollinger–Ellison syndrome, which results in excessive gastric acid \nproduction (lowering the pH of gastric chyme) inactivating lipase. \nIt usually presents with symptoms of peptic ulceration refractory to \nmedical treatment.

Joint pains, pyrexia, \nskin pigmentation and peripheral lymphadenopathy are among the \nvaried symptoms of Whipple’s disease resulting from infection with \nthe bacterium Tropheryma whipplei. Steatorrhoea is the primary \nmanifestation of intestinal lymphoma. It may be accompanied by \nabdominal pains and pyrexia and occasionally present with intestinal \nobstruction. Mouth ulcers, perianal abscesses, right iliac fossa pains \nand blood PR are some of the symptoms experienced by patients \nwith Crohn’s disease. Ataxia and night blindness from retinitis \npigmentosa may result from abetalipoproteinaemia, which is caused \nby the absence of apolipoprotein B and therefore this results in \ndefective chylomicron formation.\nPast medical history\nPrevious surgical resection involving the terminal ileum will \npredispose an individual to malabsorption of fat due to decreased \nenterohepatic circulation of bile salts. Moreover, with decreased \nlength of absorptive intestine, intestinal transit time decreases \nand there is a decrease in concomitant fat absorption. Conditions \nassociated with intestinal stasis, hypomotility and decreased gastric \nacid secretion predispose to intestinal bacterial overgrowth and \nincreased degradation of bile salts.\nEXAMINATION\nSteatorrhoea is often associated with malabsorption and \ntherefore patients may appear emaciated. Mouth ulcers may be \ndue to Crohn’s or coeliac disease. Clubbing is associated with \nCrohn’s, liver cirrhosis, coeliac disease and cystic fibrosis, which is \nassociated with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. Jaundice may \nbe present with bile duct obstruction and liver disease. Bruising \nmay result from impaired clotting due to vitamin K deficiency. \nThe classical rash of dermatitis herpetiformis may be seen with \ncoeliac disease. Erythema nodosum is a feature of Crohn’s disease \nand may be accompanied by right iliac fossa tenderness, perianal \nabscesses and fistulae. Hepatomegaly may be found in liver \ndisease, and splenomegaly with intestinal lymphoma.\nGENERAL INVESTIGATIONS\n■\n■\nFaecal fat estimation\nStool collections over a period of 3 days are performed with a \ndiet consisting of ≥50 g fat per day.

This may \nbe accompanied by urticaria and facial oedema. Enquiries should \nimmediately determine known allergens and treatment can be \ninitiated without delay. The most common cause of infantile stridor \nis laryngomalacia. During inspiration there is extreme infolding of \nthe epiglottis and aryepiglottic folds due to inadequate cartilaginous \nsupport. Head flexion aggravates the stridor, whereas patency of  \nthe airway is improved by the prone position and head extension. \nThe stridor gradually resolves in most infants within 2–3 months.\nPrecipitating factors\nIatrogenic causes of stridor may have clear precipitating factors. \nTracheal stenosis may complicate a long period of intubation or \ntracheostomy. Upper airway obstruction occurring immediately after \nthyroid surgery may be due to laryngeal oedema, haematoma and \nbilateral recurrent nerve injury. Patients who have been rescued \nfrom fires may suffer inhalation injuries due to the high temperature \nof inhaled gases.\nAssociated symptoms\nRespiratory obstruction may occur with massive enlargement \nof the tonsils, e.g. in glandular fever, or when complicated by a \nretropharyngeal abscess. Patients may notice swelling of the neck in \nthe presence of a goitre and may be either euthyroid or complain \nof symptoms of abnormal thyroid function (p. 165). Symptoms of \njoint pains, stiffness and deformities occur with rheumatoid arthritis. \nAssociated stridor can result from cricoarytenoid involvement. \nWeight loss can be an accompanying feature of malignancy. \nHoarseness of the voice is an early symptom of laryngeal carcinoma; \nstridor occurs as a late feature. Chronic cough with haemoptysis \nin a chronic smoker usually heralds the onset of bronchial \ncarcinoma. The location of the carcinoma may alter the quality of \nthe wheeze. Partial intraluminal upper airway obstruction from \nbronchial carcinoma produces stridor, whereas partial lower airways \nobstruction produces the inspiratory monophonic wheeze.

Prolonged bedrest can result in \nthe deconditioning of the baroreceptors in the body, resulting \nin a postural drop of blood pressure. A drug history may exclude \noffending medication such as antihypertensives and opiates. \nHypovolaemia is also a cause of postural hypotension (see Shock, \np. 406); it is associated with a pallor, tachycardia and a low urine \noutput.

It is necessary to define \nexactly what is meant by tiredness or fatigue. Fatigue is sometimes \nknown as ‘tired all the time syndrome’. Take a full history to decide \nwhether tiredness is of a physical, psychological or social nature. \nNote the duration of the problem. Is it getting worse? Was there any \nprecipitating factor?

Has the patient noticed any other changes, \ne.g. in appetite, increased urine output or thirst or sleep disturbances? \nHas there been any recent change in medication, e.g. beta blockers \ncausing lethargy? Chronic fatigue syndrome is more common in \nteenagers and young adults, especially students. It is uncommon after \nearly middle age. Depression is more common in women aged 30 \nand over. In middle-aged and elderly people the symptoms of chronic \nfatigue are more likely to represent underlying organic disease.\nA history of previous illnesses such as infectious mononucleosis \nor influenza should be sought. Ask about bereavement. Weight \nloss may suggest malignancy or depression with episodes of fever \nsuggesting chronic infection, e.g. TB. Cold intolerance suggests \nmyxoedema. Heat intolerance suggests thyrotoxicosis. In chronic \nfatigue syndrome the illness may fluctuate from week to week and \nmay occasionally be relieved by rest. In malignancy the symptoms are \nprogressive and deterioration occurs. The same is true for endocrine \ndisorders.

Check for the presence of \ncorns and callosities. In claw toes both IP joints are flexed (see Foot \ndeformities, p. 149).\nUlcers\nPunched out, painful ulcers over pressure points suggest ischaemic \nulcers. Check for discoloration of the toe, capillary return and \nabsence of foot pulses. Neuropathic ulcers are painless; the \ncirculation is usually good, but sensation is absent or blunted locally. \nCarry out a full neurological examination.\nDiscoloration\nWith ischaemic toe it may be shiny red, blue, white or black with \ngangrene. Examine the pulses. Chilblains are usually reddish-blue, \nthe skin being oedematous, and blistering may occur, which bursts \nleaving superficial ulcers.\nSUBASH KC/NMC-15TH/2014\n",

Aphthous ulcers are painful and are often \nassociated with chronic debilitating disease. Dental trauma from \na sharp tooth or ill-fitting dentures may cause ulcers. Chancre and \ngumma associated with syphilis are rare. Carcinoma has a peak \nincidence at 60–70 years and presents with a painless ulcer on the \ntongue, often at the margins on the dorsal surface. Carcinoma of \nthe posterior third of the tongue may present with referred pain \nto the ear, the pain being referred from the lingual branch of the \ntrigeminal nerve, which supplies the tongue, to the ear via the \nauriculotemporal nerve.\nWasting\nWasting of the tongue is caused by paralysis of the hypoglossal \nnerve. Check for a history of recent trauma or surgery to the neck, \nwhich may have damaged the hypoglossal nerve. Atrophy of the \ntongue occurs on the same side as the lesion.\nEXAMINATION\nFurring\nExamination will reveal uniformed furring of the tongue. Note its \ncolour. Look for signs of gastrointestinal disease.\nColour change\nThis will usually be obvious. White patches on the tongue may be \ndue to leucoplakia. The white plaques may fissure with time. This \nis a pre-malignant condition. Other white patches may be due to \ncandidal infection (thrush). Unlike leucoplakia, these white plaques \nmay be rubbed off, revealing ulcerated buccal mucosa underneath. \nColour changes may be uniform (pallor and cyanosis) or patchy \n(the pigmentation of Addison’s disease). In pernicious anaemia the \ntongue is red, bald and painful.\nSwelling\nThe tongue is large and tends to protrude in Down’s syndrome. \nOther signs of Down’s syndrome will be apparent, e.g. epicanthic \nfolds, mental retardation.

Is there \nany history of urinary tract infection, urethritis, ureteric colic (to \nsuggest a stone which may have passed into the bladder and then \nimpacted into the bladder neck or urethra) or haematuria? Is there \na past history of prolonged catheterisation to suggest a urethral \nstricture? A history of trauma will be apparent. Has the patient \nfallen astride an object? Has trauma caused a pelvic fracture? Is \nthe patient constipated, to suggest faecal impaction? A pregnant \nuterus will be obvious.\nGeneral\nPost-operative acute retention is common, especially in elderly \nmen. This may be due to anxiety, embarrassment, supine posture, \npain, drugs, fluid overload or previous unrecognised prostatism \nwith minimal symptoms. After urological procedures it may be due \nto blood clot in the bladder. Check for a history of neurological \ndisease. Has the patient suffered spinal cord injury? Check the drug \nhistory.\nEXAMINATION\nLocal\nThe patient may have a tender, palpable, painful bladder with sudden \nonset of retention. In acute retention the bladder rarely extends \nfar above the pubic symphysis. In chronic retention the distended \nbladder is often painless and more markedly distended than in acute \nretention, often reaching to the umbilicus. With chronic retention \nthere may be overflow incontinence. Feel along the course of the \nurethra for a stone or stricture. Perform a digital rectal examination \nto check for prostatic hypertrophy or pelvic tumour.

Ocular or optic \nnerve pathology generally causes monocular visual loss, whereas \nlesions at the optic chiasma or more posteriorly cause binocular loss \nthat will respect the vertical meridian. Loss of central vision may \nbe due to macular or optic nerve pathology. Retinal lesions cause \na ‘positive’ scotoma (the patient is aware that part of the field \nis obstructed), whereas damage posterior to the retina causes a \n‘negative’ scotoma (the patient does not see that a segment of the \nvisual field is missing).\nVisual disturbances\nBilateral flashing lights and zigzag lines are often reported by \npatients suffering with attacks of migraine. This is accompanied by \nthrobbing headache, nausea, vomiting and photophobia. Posterior \nvitreous detachment, vitreous haemorrhage and retinal detachment \nare all associated with floaters and flashing lights. Visual acuity and \nvisual fields are normal at first but may be impaired with a large \nvitreous haemorrhage or advanced retinal detachment.\nBlurring of vision\nErrors of refraction (long- or short-sighted) are the most common \ncause of blurring of vision. This is a common problem and is usually \ncorrected with glasses by optometrists. Head and eye injuries may \nalso give rise to transient blurring of the vision. With acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma, corneal oedema will give rise to the appearances \nof haloes around lights and is associated with a red and painful eye.\nLoss of vision\nVisual loss may be partial or total. The description of the area of \npartial visual field loss is very informative. Complaints of vertical \nvisual field losses are due to lesions posterior to the optic chiasma \nand most commonly caused by strokes, although similar effects can \nbe produced by space-occupying lesions such as cerebral tumours. \nSUBASH KC/NMC-15TH/2014\n",

Patients with \nglaucoma may complain of tunnel vision, and patients with macular \ndegeneration may experience sudden central visual field loss.\nSudden total visual loss is usually due to a vascular aetiology. \nAmaurosis fugax is sudden transient monocular blindness due \nto atheroembolism of the ophthalmic artery. Patients classically \ncomplain of a ‘curtain descending across the field of vision’. With \ngiant cell arteritis affecting the ophthalmic artery, sudden onset of \nblindness can occur in conjunction with the symptoms of temporal \nheadache, jaw claudication and scalp tenderness. It is often \nassociated with polymyalgia rheumatica. Papilloedema may cause \ntransient visual loss, lasting seconds, related to posture.\nMonocular blindness due to optic neuritis may occur with multiple \nsclerosis; it is often associated with retro-orbital pain that worsens \nwith eye movements and starts with a progressive dimming of vision \nover a few days.\nDiabetic retinopathy is the most common cause of blindness in \nwestern society. In addition, diabetics are also more prone to develop \ncataracts and glaucoma. In the elderly, gradual onset of visual loss may \nbe due to cataracts, glaucoma or age-related macular degeneration. \nOwing to the gradual onset of symptoms, these groups of patients may \npresent very late. A cataract may be visible on examination of the eye.\nEXAMINATION\nVisual acuity unaided and corrected with a pinhole should be \nassessed with a Snellen chart. If visualisation of the largest letter is \nnot possible then assess vision by counting fingers. Further tests to \nuse are those of movement and, finally, the ability to discriminate \nbetween light and dark. With refractive errors, vision can be \ncorrected by viewing the Snellen chart through a pinhole. Visual \nfields are examined by confrontational testing, and the extent of \nvisual field loss can be assessed approximately.\nPupillary response to light (direct and consensual) allows the \nassessment of the visual pathway. Direct light reflex may be lost in \nlesions involving the unilateral optic nerve and with central retinal \nartery occlusion.\nColour vision will be reduced disproportionately compared with \nvisual acuity in optic nerve diseases. This may be assessed with the \nuse of Ishihara plates.\nFundoscopy\nA wealth of information is obtained on fundoscopy. The red reflex is \nlost with cataracts. Examination of the retina may reveal background \nretinopathy with diabetes, consisting of dot and blot haemorrhages \nwith cotton-wool spots. With hypertensive retinopathy, silver \nwiring, arteriovenous nipping, retinal haemorrhages and eventually \npapilloedema may be appreciated.

Check for abuse of emetics, e.g. bulimia.\nCNS\nWith raised intracranial pressure there will usually be headache, \ndrowsiness and fits in addition to vomiting. With labyrinthitis \nthere will be nausea, vomiting, vertigo and often a hearing defect. \nMénière’s disease presents with vertigo, tinnitus and deafness. \nThe tinnitus is usually constant but more severe before an attack. \nTinnitus may precede other symptoms by many months. Attacks of \nMénière’s disease may last from minutes to hours. Migraine will \npresent with a visual aura with unilateral throbbing headache and \nsometimes photophobia. With motion sickness the history is usually \nobvious.\nPsychogenic\nBulimia is eating followed by self-induced vomiting. Vomiting \nmay also occur in anorexia nervosa but failure to eat is usually the \nprominent feature. Hysteria may be responsible for vomiting. Full \npsychiatric assessment is recommended.\nOthers\nFor other causes, the history will usually be obvious. There will \nusually be severe chest pain in myocardial infarction, and severe pain \nassociated with testicular torsion or trauma. A history of a fracture \nwill be obvious. There may be a history of severe chest infection, \ne.g. bronchitis or bronchiectasis, associated with coughing bouts \nfollowed by vomiting. There may be a recent history of radiotherapy \nfor malignant disease. Widespread malignant disease may cause \nvomiting.\nEXAMINATION\nGastrointestinal\nA full gastrointestinal examination should be carried out. Look for \nsigns of localised tenderness or signs of intestinal obstruction.\nCNS\nWith raised intracranial pressure there will be listlessness, irritability, \ndrowsiness, and the pulse rate will be low with a rising blood \npressure. Check for papilloedema. Ultimately coma and irregular \nbreathing will occur. With acute labyrinthitis there may be \nnystagmus to the opposite side from the lesion. The fistula test will \nbe positive (pressure on the tragus causes vertigo or eye deviation by \nreducing movement of the perilymph). Sensorineural deafness may \noccur in purulent labyrinthitis.

Decreased dietary intake may result from loss of appetite \nor loss of interest in eating due to depression. On the other hand, \npatients with thyrotoxicosis lose weight despite a voracious appetite.\nEnquiries should be undertaken regarding perception of body \nimage, as patients with anorexia nervosa believe that they are \noverweight despite being severely underweight. Risk factors for HIV \nshould be screened for and a sexual history as well as information \nregarding intravenous drug use should be obtained. Systemic enquiry \nis required to identify features suggestive of malignancy or organ \nfailure in each system to account for unintentional weight loss. A \nbutterfly rash may be present in cases of SLE.\nCardiorespiratory system\nDyspnoea, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, peripheral \noedema are symptoms suggestive of congestive cardiac failure. With \nlong-standing cardiac failure, cardiac cachexia results from loss of \ntotal body fat and lean body mass. Currently the most common \naetiology is end-stage heart failure. Dyspnoea without accompanying \northopnoea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea suggests respiratory \ndisease. With any chronic respiratory disorder, basal metabolic rate \nis increased as a result of the increased work of breathing. The \npresence of haemoptysis may be due to malignancy or TB. A long \nsmoking history is a strong predisposing factor for the development \nof bronchial carcinoma and COPD. Night sweats and weight loss may \nbe accompanying features of both TB and Hodgkin’s disease.\nGastrointestinal system\nLethargy, diarrhoea, steatorrhoea (p. 416) and abdominal discomfort \nare various symptoms suggestive of malabsorption. Jaundice, dark \nurine, pale stools, itching, prolonged bleeding, abdominal swelling \nfrom ascites and confusion are symptoms associated with liver \ndisease. Vague abdominal pains, change in bowel habit, tenesmus, \nblood or mucus mixed with the stools may be due to gastrointestinal \nmalignancy. Patients with helminth infections, such as ascaris, may \ncomplain of perianal itching and notice worms in their faeces. \nAlthough this is rare in the UK, it may be encountered in patients \nreturning from foreign travel.\nRenal system\nLethargy, anorexia, nocturia, oliguria, polyuria, haematuria, frothy \nurine from proteinuria, skin fragility, pruritus, oedema and bone pains \nare some of the multisystemic features suggestive of renal disease.\nSUBASH KC/NMC-15TH/2014\n",

Swelling \nand deformity of the small joints of the hand may be seen with \nconnective tissue disease. In addition, a rash will frequently be present \nwith SLE.\nPalpation and auscultation\nPeripheral oedema may be present with cardiac failure, \nmalabsorption, renal and liver disease. Auscultation of the chest \nmay reveal widespread crepitations with pulmonary oedema from \ncardiac failure, or uniformly decreased breath sounds with COPD. \nPalpation of the abdomen may reveal hepatomegaly and ascites \nwith liver disease; ascites may also occur with cardiac failure and \ngastrointestinal malignancies.

Mild \nto moderate chronic anaemia may be asymptomatic in young, fit \nindividuals. Symptoms of anaemia include tiredness, lethargy and \ndyspnoea. Anaemia can precipitate or worsen angina and lower limb \nclaudication.\nHistory of the underlying disorder\nBlood loss is a common cause of iron deficiency anaemia and frank \nbleeding can easily be established from the history. Occult bleeding \nfrom the gastrointestinal tract is an important cause of chronic blood \nloss. Patients may have melaena and may also experience upper \nabdominal pains from peptic ulceration, gastritis, gastro-oesophageal \nreflux or gastric carcinoma (p. 3). The causes of lower gastrointestinal \nbleeding are detailed on p. 308. The amount and frequency of blood \nloss with menstruation should be documented and the presence of \nhaemoptysis and haematuria should be ascertained. Malabsorption \ncan cause a deficiency of substrate or coenzyme requirements for \nthe synthesis of haemoglobin. Gastrectomy or atrophic gastritis with \npernicious anaemia may impair both iron and vitamin B12 absorption \ndue to alterations in pH and effects on intrinsic factor, respectively. \nImpairment of vitamin B12 absorption may also result from extensive \ndisease or resection involving the terminal ileum and predisposes to \nmegaloblastic anaemia. A history of travel to areas where malaria and \nhookworm infections are endemic should be sought.\nDietary history\nIt is important to take a dietary history, as folate deficiency results \nfrom poor dietary intake. This is in contrast to iron, as dietary \ndeficiency of iron alone rarely results in anaemia unless accompanied \nby increased utilisation or blood loss. Owing to intrinsic stores \nof vitamin B12, dietary deficiencies may take up to 2 years before \nbecoming clinically apparent. The amount of alcohol intake should \nalso be noted because alcohol excess may result in a macrocytic \nanaemia.\nPast medical and drug history\nA number of chronic diseases can result in anaemia but it is \nimportant to exclude other concomitant causes before attributing \nanaemia to the effects of the primary illness. Diseases predisposing \nto macrocytic anaemia have been listed above. Aplasia of the \nSUBASH KC/NMC-15TH/2014\n",

Respiratory tract infections \nwith mycoplasma, infectious mononucleosis, lymphomas and \nconnective tissue disease are associated with autoimmune haemolytic \nanaemia.\nFamily history\nHaemoglobinopathies such as thalassaemia and sickle cell disease \nmay be inherited. Alternatively, hereditary enzyme defects (G6PD) or \nred cell membrane defects (hereditary spherocytosis) may also result \nin intravascular haemolysis.\nEXAMINATION\nClassically, patients with anaemia have pallor of the palmar skin \ncreases and conjunctivae; however, diagnosis based solely on these \nfindings is unreliable.

Bleeding in the first few \ndays of life occurs as a result of deficient vitamin K synthesis by \nthe neonatal liver, due to immaturity. Patients with haemophilia \nusually present at a young age with excessive blood loss following \ninjuries or surgical procedures, such as circumcision. Muscle \nhaematomas and painful haemarthroses may be accompanying \nfeatures.\nPast medical history\nConcomitant disease constitutes the majority of causes of acquired \ncoagulation disturbances. As coagulation factors are synthesised \nin the liver, disease of the liver naturally predisposes to clotting \nabnormalities. Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin essential for the \nproduction of clotting factors II, VII, IX and X. Conditions, such as \nobstructive jaundice, pancreatic or small bowel disease, that impair \nthe absorption of fat will result in decreased production of the \naforementioned factors.\n526\nSUBASH KC/NMC-15TH/2014\n",

      "text": "527\nCLOTTING DISORDERS\nSection C\nPatients with SLE may produce antibodies such as the lupus \nanticoagulant, which, although prolonging clotting in in vitro \ntesting, predisposes to thrombosis in vivo.\nSevere infections, malignancy, obstetric complications and burns \nmay give rise to DIC. This is characterised by widespread consumption \nof clotting factors and platelets, resulting in severe coagulation \ndisturbances.\nDrug history\nCoagulation abnormalities may be iatrogenic. Therapeutic \nanticoagulation is achieved with heparin and warfarin. Thrombolytic \nagents produce severe derangement of clotting as a side-effect of \ntherapy. Coagulation disturbances can result from dilution from \nmassive blood transfusions (when the patient’s entire circulating \nvolume has been replaced by transfusion within 24 hours).\nEXAMINATION\nA general examination is performed to identify any stigmata from \nhaemophilia. Early-onset osteoarthritis and pseudotumours may \nresult from episodes of repeated haemorrhage. Skin necrosis and \nhaematomas may be seen with warfarin overdosage. In acquired \ncoagulation disorders signs of liver disease may bring attention to \nthe underlying disorder.\nGENERAL INVESTIGATIONS\n■\n■\nFBC\nLow platelet count or abnormal platelet function result in \nprolonged bleeding time but not clotting results.\n■\n■\nClotting screen\nPT, APTT and TT are measured.
