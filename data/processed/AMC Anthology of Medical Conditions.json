Clinically, distension is separable into two main types\nof presentation: Acute distension (usually painful and predominantly surgical), or\nChronic/Subacute distension (usually painiess and associated with obstetrical/\ngynaecological and medical causes). Remember all the ‘F's, which cover many of the\ncauses over both groups: Fluid, Flatus, Faeces, Fat, Fetus, large Focal masses, and\nthe False impressions of pseudopregnancy.\n\nCauses\n\n1) Acute abdominal distension\n\na) Mechanical intestinal obstruction (luminal, wall, extrinsic — usually\npainful)\n\nThe most common causes are adhesions, tumours, hernias, volvulus\nI Gastric outlet obstruction — ‘pyloric’ stenosis\n\n-!

Possible causes are legion,\nas indicated below.\n\nAccordingly the symptom is not of high diagnostic value unless it is the outstanding\nfeature of a patient's presenting complaint or associated with certain other symptoms\nsuch as loss of weight, chest pain, breathlessness, diarrhoea, rectal bleeding. An\norganic cause will be found in only about one-third of patients with ‘fatigue’ as their\nmain complaint; many people with heavy domestic or occupational commitments present\n— not unreasonably — with fatigue.\n\nOf the remainder, about two-thirds will be suffering from a psychological condition.\nPatients commonly use fatigue to somatise an underlying psychological problem. The\nchallenges are to identify underlying organic causes or associated pathology and\nmanage these appropriately, whilst recognising those patients without physical illness\nwho require more than simple reassurance and advice.\n\nCauses\n\n1) Psychologic\n\na) Depression\n\nb) Anxiety\n\nc) Somatisation\nd) Bereavement\ne) Lifestyle factors\n\n2) Pharmacologic\n\na) Hypnotics\n\nb) Antihypertensives\n\nc) Antidepressants\n\nd) Alcohol\n\ne) Drug abuse or withdrawal\n\n3) Endocrine/Metabolic\n\na) Hypothyroidism\n\nb) Diabetes mellitus\n\nc) Adrenal disease (Addison disease, Cushing disease)\nd) Chronic renal failure\n\ne) Chronic liver failure\n\nf) Hypercalcaemia\n\ng) Hypokalaemia\n\nh) Hypomagnesaemia\n",

They may\npresent as concern with the cosmetic appearance of the visible venous swellings, or\nas a source of local chronic discomfort worse on standing and eased by recumbency.\nAcute symptoms result from localised acute thrombosis in superficial veins (superficial\nthrombophlebitis) causing a painful palpable subcutaneous cord. Deep venous\nthrombosis (DVT) may complicate superficial varices or arise independently (see\n#034B Unilateral Limb Oedema (Swollen Limb)). In the post-thrombotic syndrome,\nleg ulceration follows chronic deep venous insufficiency. Significant risk factors\nassociated with ‘primary’ vascular veins are the female sex, pregnancy and multiparity,\nand a family history.\n\nCauses\n\n1) ‘Primary’ varicose veins of lower limb — cause unknown\n\nOften associated with female gender, systemic hormonal effects, pregnancies, familial\ninfluences, iliac (left) vein compression; or to primary valvular incompetence in\nsuperficial veins and in the communications between deep and superficial venous\nsystem.\n\n2) ‘Secondary’ varicose veins of lower limb\n\nSuperficial varices secondary to deep venous obstruction or incompetence,\narteriovenous fistulae, or compression from pelvic mass.\n\n294\n",

Broad-\nspectrum analgesic management using an ‘analgesic ladder’ approach to maximise\nanalgesic effect is required.\n\nUse of adjuvant analgesics, psychotropic medications, laxatives when using opioid\nanalgesics, and anti-emetics form part of this approach. All cancer patients requiring\nanalgesics need close and compassionate supervision to achieve maximum comfort\nwith minimal adverse effects.\n\nCauses\nPain can be associated with most cancers; the most common associations in Australia\nare with lung, bowel, breast, prostate, lymphoma and pancreas.\n\nBony metastasis — Spinal metastasis —\nlung cancer renal cancer\n\n366\n",

It is an accepted leisure pursuit enjoyed by the majority\nof adult Australians. Problem gambling may affect one to three percent of the adult\npopulation. Two-thirds of problem gamblers are men, who typically present in their\nthirties (women present later) and have problems with continuous forms of gambling\nsuch as poker machines (slots), off-course agency betting, casino or internet gaming\nor the stock market.\n\nProblem gamblers are preoccupied with gambling and have needed to use increasing\namounts of money or goods to continue. They have had repeated unsuccessful\nattempts to cut back, control or stop their gambling. They tend to gamble more when\nthey are losing to chase their losses and then rely on others to provide the money to\nrelieve the desperate financial situations created by their gambling. They gamble to\nescape personal or work problems or to relieve dysphoria, anxiety or depression.\nThey frequently lie to conceal the extent of their gambling involvement, and many will\nhave jeopardised or lost a significant relationship or career opportunity as a result.\nMany will have committed illegal acts such as forgery, fraud, theft or embezzlement to\nfinance their gambling, and 20% will make a serious attempt at suicide. Bipolar\npatients may gamble excessively when in a manic phase.

Suicide is a conscious fatal self-destructive act, which although grievous, is\nrelatively rare. Suicidal ideation and intent may fluctuate unpredictably over brief\nperiods of time. Suicidal behaviour has no single cause but a conjunction of many\nbiopsychosocial and cognitive factors. Hypofunction of brain serotonin systems may\nexplain some suicidal behaviour.\n\nAbout 2,000 Australians commit suicide each year and at least 20,000 deliberately\nharm themselves annually. Most people who commit suicide have visited a doctor\n(either clinician or psychiatrist) in the weeks prior to the act. Knowledge of the major\nrisk and protective factors for self-harm, as well as the predisposing and precipitating\nevents, is essential for appropriate early identification and management in primary\ncare.

Trauma/Accidents/Prevention\n\n113N Vascular Injuries\n\nOverview\n\nVascular injuries of blunt trauma often involve vessels near joints (e.g. knee, elbow)\nwhere vessels are relatively fixed and vulnerable to the shearing forces of fractures\nand dislocations. Complete or partial transection of the vessel can result in significant\nlocal haematoma; alternatively, thrombosis may be due to intimal rupture and elastic\nrecoil without significant blood loss. Penetrating vascular injuries result usually from\nstab, gunshot or other missile wounds and are more likely to involve segmental loss of\nartery and vein, especially with high-velocity missile injuries. Although haemorrhage,\nhaematoma, a pulse deficit and distal ischaemia are cardinal signs of vascular injury,\na high index of suspicion is required as, in nearly one-third of patients with penetrating\narterial injuries of limbs, signs of distal ischaemia are absent and distal pulses are\npalpable.\n\nCommon Causes of Vascular Injury\n1) Closed injury (e.g. motor vehicle accidents (MVA))\na) Head and neck injuries (epidural haemorrhage, carotid occlusion)\n\nb) Supracondylar humeral fracture, fracture/dislocation of the elbow\n(brachial artery occlusion)\n\nc) Fractured pelvis (major iliac venous and arterial bleeding)\nd) Closed chest injuries (aortic tear)\n\ne) Supracondylar femoral fracture, dislocated knee (popliteal artery\nocclusion)\n\nf) Hyperextension lumbar spine injuries (renal arteries)\n\nOpen injury (penetrating knife or gunshot wounds of neck,\nabdomen, groin, iatrogenic injury)\n\nKey Objectives\n¢ Diagnose major vascular injuries early by appropriate assessment and\nhigh index of suspicion.\n\nProvide initial management and obtain consultation when indicated.\n\nClassify whether injury is occlusive or haemorrhagic with open vessel.\n\n449\n",

Violence is a deliberate attempt to inflict physical harm. Dangerousness\nrefers to the likelihood of whether individuals present a risk of harming themselves or\nothers. Clinicians are confronted with the direct and indirect consequences of violent\nbehaviour and will be increasingly expected to make risk assessments of future\ndangerousness. Although comorbidity of some mental illnesses increases the risk of\nviolence, most episodes of violence are not committed by mentally ill people. The best\npredictor of future violence is past violence, but violent behaviour is usually the result\nof the interaction of many factors.\n\nPredisposing Causal Factors\n1)\n\nPre-existing vulnerabilities (gender, age, personality, impulsivity,\nintellectual functioning, neurobiology, individual sensitivity,\nconduct disorder, family and cultural influences)\n\n2) Psychiatric disorders\n\na) Schizophrenia (with active paranoid, or grandiose ideation or\ncommand hallucinations, treatment resistance and impaired insight)\n\nb) Delusional disorder (particularly morbid jealousy)\n\nc) Substance abuse (intoxication, withdrawal)\n\nd) Major depression with delusions\n\ne) Personality disorder (antisocial, borderline, conduct disorder)\nf) Intermittent explosive disorder\n\ng) Bipolar affective disorder (manic phase)\n\nh) Cognitive disorders (delirium, dementia)\n\n3)\n\nSituational triggers (loss, actual or threatened; confrontation;\navailability of weapons and presence of a potential victim)\n\nKey Objectives\n* List risk factors for dangerousness.\n\n* Recognise signs of imminent violence: threats, paranoid ideas, shouting\nand pacing, agitated behaviour.\n\n464\n",

They can affect anyone irrespective\nof economic, social, geographic or racial background, resulting in significant morbidity\nand mortality. From a health perspective, domestic violence is a chronic syndrome\ncharacterised not only by physical violence, but also by emotional and psychological\nabuse. It is the abuse of power in a relationship involving domination, coercion,\nintimidation and the victimisation of o~; person by another, typically a male partner.\nWomen are eight times more likely to be victims than males. The perpetrators are\noften young, troubled, unemployed men with low self-esteem, who have been abused\nthemselves. Shame and isolation militate against disclosure, but health professionals\nhave responsibility to break the silence. Depression and post-traumatic stress disorder\nare common sequelae for victims, as are alcohol and drug abuse, self-harm and\nsuicide. Barriers to disclosure often lie with the clinician and not the victim. Programmes\nfor stopping domestic violence can be effective for those who are motivated to change\ntheir behaviour.\n\nClassification of Domestic/Family Violence\n\n1) Physical: resulting in pain, injury, denial of sleep, warmth or\nnutrition, denial of medical care, violence to animals and\n\nproperty, disablement and murder: dowry and honour killings\n\n2) Sexual: coerced sex, rape, harassment, incest, pornography\n\n3) Verbal: designed to humiliate, degrade, demean, intimidate,\nsubjugate, including the threat of physical violence\n\n4) Economic: deprivation of basic necessities, seizure of income or\nassets, unreasonable denial of the means to participate in social\n\nlife\n\n5) Social: isolation, control of social activity, deprivation of liberty\n\nor the deliberate creation of unreasonable dependence\n\n470\n",

In a 10-year period\nbetween 1980 and 1990, in rounded figures there were 5 fatal crocodile and 10 fatal\nshark attacks in Australia.
