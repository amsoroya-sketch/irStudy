To \nthe patient, therefore, the student must go.' \nAbraham Flexner (1866-1959) \nMedical Education, a Comparative Study \nThe MCAT is an integrated OSCE-style clinical examination where each candidate \nproceeds through the same number of stations — 16 stations in the full exam, 8 stations in \nthe retest. \nCONTENT OF STATIONS \nAt each station, two minutes are allocated for preliminary reading outside the room. An \ninstruction sheet giving the candidate specific information and tasks required is provided. \nThis introduces the candidate to the consultation setting and clinical situation. It may also \ninclude patient profile test results or an illustration. Specific tasks that the candidate will be \nasked to perform are itemised. A duplicate copy of the instructions is provided in the \nexamination room. \nThis is followed by eight minutes performing the required task in a room \nwith a standardised patient. When the candidate first enters the room, the \nobserving examiner will check that the instructions for the station have \nbeen read and will then introduce the candidate to the patient. The \nexaminer will then observe the performance and record the \ncandidate's performance on a tailored mark sheet. The standardised \npatient may be a real patient or a simulated patient (role player) who \nplays the role of either the patient or a relative. Doctor-patient \ncommunication performance contributes to the assessment and requires \na well-trained role player. Where scenarios are based on physical \nexamination, the 'role player' may be a real patient. \nThe aims of the \nstation, the tasks \nthat candidates are \nasked to perform, \nthe key issues and \nassessment \ndomains defined \nfor the station are \nall closely aligned. \n \n \n \n \n031 \nFIGURE III. \nHistory-taking \nFIGURE iv. \nCommencing the Physical Examination \nThe aims of the station, the tasks that candidates are asked to perform, the key issues \nand assessment domains defined for the station are all closely aligned. \n",

      "text": " \n032\nThe MCAT scenarios developed for assessment purposes are designed to simulate closely real \nlife situations within medical consultations. These may be in a general practice setting, a hospital \nemergency department, or a hospital inpatient or outpatient setting. Scenarios deal with different \nphases of illnesses. Diagnostic scenarios include the diagnostic phases of history taking, physical \nexamination, and ordering and interpreting investigations. The management phases incorporate \npatient explanation and education, advice and referral, therapeutics and preventive medicine, \nclinical procedures and counselling. Scenarios are focused precisely so that the assessment \ndomains, key issues and critical errors are accurately related to the station aims and the tasks set \ndown in the candidate's instructions. \nMembers of the AMC clinical examination panel suggest MCAT clinical scenarios based on their \nprevalence, seriousness, preventability and whether they can be simulated as real life situations \nwithin the inherent time constraints. Scenarios are thoroughly reviewed and approved by the \nmultidisciplinary clinical panel prior to use. The current 16 or 8 station MCAT formats cover a \nbroad spectrum of skills in clinical medicine, psychiatry, surgery, obstetrics/gynaecology, and \npaediatrics, including emergency, hospital and community practice medicine. \nMCAT MARKING \nIn an MCAT, candidates are assessed at the level of a final year medical student, i.e. a doctor \nabout to commence an intern year (PGY1). \nMark sheets for examiner use. \nThe examiner scores the candidate's performance on a mark sheet which specifies the \nassessment domains, key domains, and critical errors if appropriate. The assessment domains \nmatch the tasks outlined on the instructions the candidates receive during the two minutes \npreliminary reading. \nThe marking domains are identified from among a total of 14 covering: \n• approach to patient and responses to patient's questions; \n• patient counselling and education; \n• history-taking; \n• physical examination choice and technique; \n• physical examination accuracy; \n• choice of investigations; \n• interpretation of investigations; \n• diagnosis and differential diagnosis; \n• initial management plan; \n• explanation of clinical procedure; \n• performance of clinical procedure; \n• familiarity with test equipment; \n• commentary to examiner; and \n• answers to examiner's questions, \nNo single station is likely to have assessment in more than five of these domains. \nEach domain has a 4-point marking scale: \n• Very satisfactory        Clear pass \n• Satisfactory             Pass \n• Unsatisfactory           Fail \n• Very unsatisfactory      Clear fail \n",

Not \nall stations have critical errors. If the candidate makes a critical error the candidate is very likely to \nfail that station, regardless of performance in other domains, unless performance in other \ndomains is outstanding and the critical error is deemed possibly related to lack of time or \nmisunderstanding of the task. MCAT performance is checked and reviewed by the Clinical Panel \nof Examiners after each use in an examination. All details, particularly presence and definition of \ncritical errors, are reassessed and retained or modified in light of candidate performance and \nexaminer feedback. \nStation failure would probably result from two or more 'unsatisfactory — fail' assessments or one \n'very unsatisfactory — fail' assessment in a key issue domain, or from making a critical error in a \nkey issue domain. \nAfter scoring each of the domains, the examiner will provide an overall (final) rating that is either \n'Pass' or 'Fail' for each station. \nAll 16 MCAT scenarios are of equal weighting and for each scenario there are only two outcomes \n— pass or fail. Candidates must obtain a pass in 12 or more of the 16 stations, including a pass in \nat least one paediatric and one obstetric/gynaecology station, to pass the MCAT as a whole. \nCandidates scoring pass levels in nine or less of the 16 stations, or with failures in all three of the \npaediatric or obstetric/gynaecology stations, fail the examination and must resit. \nCandidates who pass 10 or 11 of the 16 stations (including a pass in at least one obstetric/ \ngynaecology station and one paediatric station) will be eligible for a pass/fail Retest Examination \nof 8 stations. Retest candidates will be required to pass six or more of the eight retest stations to \npass the examination.

In each instance the reader is provided with a synopsis heading, outlining \nthe clinical problem/condition together with the information available to the candidate and \ndetails of the task to be undertaken, exactly as this appears in the MCAT examination. \nINSTRUCTIONS TO CANDIDATES \nYou may wish to attempt to complete the tasks in each of the major categories before \nmoving to the next group. If you would prefer to review tasks by system and region, or by \ndiscipline, the appropriate groupings of these are listed in later pages. Page numbers of \nindividual MCATs are listed in the table of contents at the beginning of the book for easy \nreference. \nAfter reading carefully the information provided to you for each clinical scenario and the \nrequired tasks, jot down how you will approach this consultation, how you will advise the \npatient or relative of your findings and recommendations, and how you would structure \nresponses to queries from patient or examiner. Then turn the pages to check your \nresponses against the optimum Performance Guidelines, Examiner Instructions and \nCommentaries. Note the station Aims, Key issues and Critical Errors outlined. \nIn this book the scenarios are grouped into five main categories. The groupings are to some \ndegree artificial in that communication skills are relevant to all scenarios. For example, \naspects of diagnosis, management, and patient counselling and education are frequently \ncombined to varying degree, but the groupings are arranged to emphasise and categorise \nthe principal domains even though most scenarios are assessed over multiple domains. \nThe five groupings below condense the total of 14 domain assessments into five categories \ncovering skills principally in: \n1. Clinical Communication (C) — with patient, relative and observer, and including a \nnumber of domains: approach to patient, patient counselling/education, history-taking, \ncommentary to examiner, answers to patient's or examiner's questions, explanation of \nprocedure, case presentation and summary. \n2. Clinical Diagnosis (D) — includes history-taking, technique and accuracy of physical \nexamination, choice of investigations and their interpretation, diagnosis/differential \ndiagnosis. \n3. Clinical Management (M) — includes initial management plan, performance of \nprocedure/task, treatment and prevention of disease, clinical procedures. \n4. Integrated Diagnosis and Management (D/M) — includes clinical perspectives and \npriorities, life-threatening emergencies, integrative reasoning skills and clinical \nproblem-solving. \n5. Legal, Ethical and Organisational (LEO) — includes scenarios where ethical and legal \nissues are significant. \n",

These tendons form the \nmargins of the anatomical snuff box as illustrated. The tendons have been severed at \nthe knuckle level of the metacarpophalangeal joint. The patient has no obvious thumb \ndeformity but is unable actively to extend either the metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint or \nthe interphalangeal (IP) joint of the thumb. The digital cutaneous nerves have not \nbeen cut and distal sensation is normal apart from tenderness around the cut. \nExtension of the joints of the thumb occurs from the actions of: \n• Extensor pollicis longus (EPL) the ulnar-sided of the two thumb tendons running \non the dorsal aspect of the thumb. The long tendon of EPL runs obliquely across \nthe back of the hand after angulating around the tubercle of the radius (Lister \ntubercle) before inserting into the base of the distal phalanx. EPL is the prime \nmover and sole extensor of the terminal (interphalangeal) joint. By passing across \nthe metacarpophalangeal (MP) and carpometacarpal (CM) joints of the thumb. \nEPL can also act as an accessory extensor of these joints. EPL, like other \nsuperficial tendons, may be injured by cuts and penetrating injuries. \n• Extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) is the lateral of the two thumb extensors. EPB runs \nin the same synovial sheath as the tendon of abductor pollicis longus on the lateral \nsurface of the radius and continues over the dorsal shaft of the metacarpal to \ninsert into the base of the proximal phalanx. EPB is the prime mover in extension of \nthe MP joint and an accessory extensor of the CM joint. Cuts around the knuckle of \nthe metacarpophalangeal joint are likely to sever one or both tendons. In this \npatient, both EPL and EPB have been severed. \n• Abductor pollicis longus (APL). This stout tendon, often multiple or ridged like a \nstalk of celery, inserts dorsolateral^ into the base of the thumb metacarpal. APL is \nthe prime mover of radial abduction and extension of the thumb at the carpo-\nmetacarpal joint, separating the thumb from the other digits in the plane of the palm. \nIn this patient, radial abduction will be unaffected as APL has not been injured. \n",

      "text": "Clinical Communication (C) \n1-A: Communication, Counselling & \nPatient Education \nAlan T Rose \n'Oh, that's your doctor, is it? What sort of a doctor is he?' \nWell, I don't know much about his ability, but he's got a very good bedside manner!' \nGeorge du Maurier, Punch Cartoon, 15 March 1884. \n1-A COMMUNICATION, COUNSELLING AND PATIENT EDUCATION \nCommunication is the exchange of messages and thoughts by speech, signals or writing. \nCommunication skills are employed to ensure that exchanges are readily and clearly \nunderstood. Exchanges involve the sharing of information, ideas, emotions, and empathy. \nCommunication is the foundation on which medical consulting takes shape, supplemented \nby the practitioner's skill in physical examination and diagnostic reasoning. Failure of \ncommunication is an important contributor to clinical situations of perceived malpractice \nand is the most important factor in a high proportion of medicolegal actions. \nMost medical consultations and activities require the doctor and \npatient to communicate rationally and effectively with each other. \n \n045 \nExceptions are when the patient is an infant or is intellectually \nhandicapped — communication is then with a relative or carer — \nor when the patient is unconscious (including when \nanaesthetised) or suffering from certain psychotic states, or \nwhen doctor and patient do not share the same language. \nCommunication requires special techniques with patients who \nare blind, mute, aphonic or aphasic. Impaired hearing may \naffect either patient or doctor. The role of the interpreter, when \nrequired, is also critical. Involvement of third parties (such as \nrelatives, friends, or outside agencies) requires the patient's \nconsent. In these situations the patient's legal right to \nThe AMC examination \nprocess places \nconsiderable emphasis \non assessment of \neffective communication \nbetween candidate and \npatient during clinical \nconsultations, during \ndiscussions with \nrelatives, and during \ncase presentations and \ncommentaries. \nconfidentiality and privacy must be respected. \nThe AMC examination process places considerable emphasis on assessment of effective \ncommunication between candidate and patient during clinical consultations, during \ndiscussions with relatives, and during case presentations and commentaries. Written \ncommunications are important for letters of referral and discharge summaries, but are less \nreadily assessed within the current AMC format. \nVerbal communication depends on a mutual understanding of the language being used \nand the way it is articulated. This includes pronunciation, auditory level, speed, tone and \nthe unique voice qualities and cadences of the speaker. The AMC examination assesses \ncommunication in the English language in a medical and clinical context. English is not the \nfirst language for many IMGs, but all IMGs are required to have adequate clinical communi-\ncation skills in English by medical registration boards. \n",

      "text": " \nNonverbal communication (such as facial expression, posture, gesturing, silence, and \nemoting) by either doctor or patient, also conveys messages as well as influencing the \nunderstanding of what is being said and its emotional context. \nEffective verbal and nonverbal communication in medical practice facilitates the establish-\nment of empathy and rapport, trust and confidence, mutual understanding, education about \nthe clinical condition, and satisfactory compliance with advice and treatment. \nThe term 'bedside manner', used to describe a doctor's communication skills, was first \nused in a London 'Punch' cartoon by George du Maurier. \nWide variations in clinical communication skills occur because of each individual doctor's \ninherent personality traits and individual approach to patients. These can be modified and \nimproved by education and self awareness, so that time is saved and any frustrations felt \nby the doctor or dissatisfaction by the patient are minimised. \nSimilarly, the cultural characteristics of the patient (and of the doctor) can profoundly affect \nthe quality of doctor-patient communication. Doctors practising in Australia require \nmulticultural competence across all fields of medicine. Special care is required in the case of \nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, and for culturally and linguistically diverse groups. \nCommunication skills, although important, are not sufficient. Good communication skills \nmust be accompanied by sound clinical skills, attitudes and professional behaviour. The \n(fortunately) rare physician serial criminal murderers have usually been superb \ncommunicators. \nOther personal factors can interfere with the doctor's use of communication skills. Many \nclinical realities are unpleasant to both patient and doctor. If the doctor retreats behind a \nprofessional fagade of a stilted and portentous style of speech, or adopts a pompous or \npretentious attitude, or one interpreted as such, the patient can be daunted from further \nenquiry. Rejection by the doctor of a patient's attitude or behaviour engenders lack of \nunderstanding and trust. Value judgements of the doctor are best avoided or concealed. \nCare and compassion should be evident but not forced or obtrusive. This is especially \nimportant when treating users of illicit drugs or dependent alcoholics. Mention should also \nbe made of the so-called 'difficult patient' whose underlying but sometimes unrecognised \npersonality disorder reduces or eliminates the effectiveness of the communication skills \ndescribed below. \nThe application of communication skills \nEffective communication is of most value when taking a history, providing patient education \nabout the condition diagnosed, giving advice about treatment, counselling patients, and \nwhen discussing the patient's illness with anxious relatives or friends. \nHistory-taking \nThere are two main methods. Transition from one to the other occurs depending on the \nclinical setting and progress of this phase of the consultation. The aim is to define the \npresenting problem to a point where the diagnosis moves from possible to probable to \ndefinite. \nFirstly, the nondirective or 'open-ended' approach: this allows and encourages patients \nto outline the problem ('tell their story') in their own way while the doctor listens with \nlittle interruption. Although apparent irrelevancies may be brought up, this method gives \nan opportunity for patients to reveal concerns initially unstated. These concerns may \nexplain their real reason for attending and why they have come at this particular time. \n \n046 \n",

      "text": " \nThis approach is most useful when the patient is consulting the doctor for the first time \nabout undifferentiated symptoms such as 'tiredness', 'bloating', 'being run down', 'sleep-\nlessness', or 'requesting a checkup'. \nSecondly, the directive, closed or interrogative approach: this confines the patient to \nthe doctor's agenda. This is appropriate in emergencies and, if the problem has already \nbeen well defined, when a patient's progress is being reviewed in followup. The doctor \ntakes early control of the interview by the use of a series of direct or closed questions. \nThis approach is well summarised by the traditional term — history 'taking'. The directive \napproach risks the omission of significant information, particularly from a patient who is \nanxious, reticent, embarrassed, or has feelings of shame or guilt. \nNonverbal communication is very useful in the nondirective approach and can replace some \nparts of the verbal component, for example, expressing surprise by facial expression. \nTransition from nondirective to directive mode occurs when the doctor begins to ask direct \nor closed questions, but the two modes are usually phased or overlap. The type of question \nused will change the direction of the interview. Using questions about pain as examples: \nopen ended      'Tell me about the pain?' \ndirect \nWhere Is the pain?' \nclosed \n'Have you had this pain before?' \nleading \n'The pain isn't severe?' \nA series of direct or closed questions is usually necessary to complete the history regarding \noccupation, past and family illness, domestic habits, medications, allergies and sensitivities, \nwhere relevant. \nFacilitation is also a valuable nondirective tool. Facilitation uses nonspecific inviting or \nencouraging remarks, for example, 'go on', 'I'm listening carefully', 'tell me more about the \npain', 'anything else?', 7 see', or 'uh uh'. \nListening is an essential basis of communication. Adequate time must be given and the \ndoctor's nonverbal behaviour should indicate to the patient that the listening is attentive. \nNote-taking should be discreet and avoid distraction. The use of a personal computer by the \ndoctor in the consulting room while taking a history requires, more than ever, that the doctor's \nnonverbal behaviour assures patients that they are being 'listened to'. Silence is not the same \nas listening. Silence may be the best response when there is an emotional or confrontational \ncomponent in the consultation. \nConfrontation can defuse an issue ('Wouldn't we progress better if we leave aside for the \nmoment your previous dissatisfaction with treatment and try to work out how best to fix \nthings now?') but should be used with care. Frequently initial aggression or anger from the \npatient is better deflected in the first instance. \nSummarising briefly what the doctor believes the patient has said so far is often useful to \nconfirm that mutual understanding at that point in the interview is present. \nAs previously noted, these techniques are modified by the personality and instinctive \nbehaviour of the doctor, who may not always be fully aware of their effect on a patient. The \nperceptive doctor attempts always to appreciate the patient's perspectives as well as the \ndoctor's own. \nIn summary, the following guidelines apply to history 'taking' from a patient presenting with \na nonurgent diagnostic problem. \n \n047 \n",

In many of the \nMCAT clinical scenarios, direct questioning is essential to enable a focused history \nto be taken within the time period available. \nCommunication skills are especially important when the patient has concerns other than \nthose expressed in the first statement to the doctor. Such hidden concerns may include \nfears of cancer, heart disease, stroke, blindness, sexually transmitted infection, work \ncapacity, relationships, serious illness in an unborn child or infant, dissatisfaction with \ntreatment and feelings of grief or guilt — to mention only a few. \nPatient education \nOnce the diagnosis has been made, it should be stated to the patient using both medical \nand lay terminology appropriate to the patient's understanding. Initial reassurance should be \ngiven when appropriate ('I'm pleased to tell you that the biopsy showed no evidence of \ncancer'). Failure to do so may allow patient anxiety to block the reception of other information. \nReassurance may be the only therapy that is necessary — unnecessary prescribing may \nfollow if the doctor has not understood this basic need of the patient for reassurance. \nThe patient's knowledge and understanding of the condition should then be established so \nthat education can be pitched at the correct level. This includes the correction of incorrect \nbeliefs and responses to the patient's questions. The use of a chart, diagram or of printed \nnotes, may be additionally helpful. \nAs previously stated, anxiety may reduce the efficiency of absorbing and understanding \ninformation. Patients will also differ in their interest and tolerance of information about their \nailments. Most will want to know if the condition is serious, whether it can be treated, when \nthey will recover and resume normal activities, and what forms treatment will take, even \nthough these questions may not be asked directly. Overloading the patient with information \ncan be counterproductive and have unwanted effects including the creation of pessimism \nand anxiety. Further information can be added at a subsequent consultation. Handing out \npreviously prepared written material is helpful for most patients but is no substitute for \nverbal education from the doctor. \nAdverse information should be given in such a way so as to not destroy hope, and also to \nassure the patient of the doctor's continuing support. \nAn adequate level of understanding is the only basis on which patients can share the \nresponsibility of decision-making about treatment and give informed consent.

If thought necessary, confrontation \ncan be used to bring to the attention of patients their own responsibilities in aiding effective \ntreatment. \nGiving advice about treatment \nThe wide ranges of treatments, which may be indicated, include giving simple advice, \nprescribing, minor or major procedures, the use of allied health professional services, \nreferral to another doctor or to a hospital service, and counselling. All require the use of \ncommunication skills, either verbal, nonverbal, or written. When counselling is the main \ncomponent of treatment, additional special skills are required. \nThe duration of intended treatment should be advised to the patient and opportunities for \ngiving preventive advice taken whenever appropriate. This may involve other members of \nthe patient's family. \nPrescribing should be supported by a statement of the name of the medication, which may \nalso be written down for the patient, the dose and timing, expected effects including the \nmost important side effects, and significant adverse reactions. \nPatients will also wish to know general details about any procedure which has been \nrecommended, and what to expect when a referral has been made. \nPatients should not be left wondering what happens next. Certainty about followup \narrangements, particularly after investigations or referral, should be made quite clear. \nNeglect of these can have medicolegal consequences. \nPatient Counselling \nCounselling is a term widely used in the community to describe the provision of support to \nindividuals or groups who are experiencing significant emotional stress. Counsellors, \nusually with special training in psychological skills, attend survivors or observers of \naccidents and disasters and provide support. \nDoctors frequently need to give 'bad news' to patients and relatives, and are involved with \nbereavement and grieving responses. Allowing patients and relatives to work through their \nfeelings by means of facilitation and attentive listening, and providing support and \nreassurance whenever possible, with unforced compassion and sympathetic \nunderstanding, is required every day in clinical practice. \nHowever, when 'patient counselling' is used in treatment, there are two types: directive and \nnondirective. As with other communication skills these may overlap or be used in an \nintegrated way. However, one type usually predominates according to the clinical situation. \nDirective counselling is when straightforward advice or instruction are given to the patient. \nIn contrast, nondirective counselling is a special communication skill which involves more \nthan patient education or giving advice about treatment. Its objective is that the patient, \ninstead of the doctor, is the final decision-maker and shares or accepts, in part or fully, \nresponsibility for the subsequent course and outcome of the problem. Nondirective \ncounselling begins with an accurate definition of the problem using the skills outlined under \nnondirective history-taking, particularly listening and the use of silence. The doctor then \nprovides education about the problem including possible outcomes that are likely to follow \nalternative forms of behaviour or non-compliance by the patient. Patients are then asked \nwhat course they intend to follow, based on the options that have been discussed. The \nprocess may occur rapidly or may take more than one consultation to work through. It is \nessential for the doctor to maintain a nonjudgmental attitude throughout the process. \n \n049\n",

These are: \nApproach to patient \n• Empathy, comfort, consideration, \n• Explanation, using language that the patient understands (no jargon), \n• Checking for patient understanding, \n• Answering patient's, parent's or relative's questions, and \n• Obtaining verbal consent to proceed. \nHistory \n• Taking an appropriately focused medical history. \nCommentary to examiner \n• Describing the findings of physical examination with appropriate commentary; and \n• Presenting a case analysis in summary to the examiner. \nDiagnosis/differential diagnosis \n• Describing an appropriate diagnosis/differential diagnosis plan. \nInitial management plan \n• Describing an appropriate initial management plan. \nPatient counselling/education \n• Educating the patient/relative/carer about the condition; and \n• Giving appropriate counselling. \nExplanation of procedure \n• Explaining a procedure and its implications to the patient. \nAnswering questions asked by the patient or examiner \n• Most scenarios include cued questions to the doctor by the patient, parent or relative; and \n• Some scenarios have specific prompts or questions from the examiner. \nEach of the above domains (plus others such as technique and accuracy of examination - \n14 in all) attracts separate assessment by the examiner.

This scenario tests the candidate's ability to \nidentify the conflict the young mother has in trying to respect what her mother has told her, while \nknowing that this advice is contrary to her own feelings. It also tests ability to discuss logically the \nadvantages and disadvantages of the different feeding methods as well as testing knowledge on \nsafe bottle-feed preparation. \nEXAMINER INSTRUCTIONS \nThe examiner will have instructed the patient as follows: \nYou are a 28-year-old mother having your first baby. You now have only five weeks to go and \nalthough you always hoped to breastfeed your infant, you have had some doubts about its value \nrecently when your mother mentioned that formula-fed babies grow better than babies who have \nbeen breastfed. You have come to discuss this. You realise that you may have to defend what \nthe doctor says to you (about breastfeeding being advantageous), and your own previously held \nideas about breastfeeding, against the ideas of your mother with whose opinions you have to \nlive. \nOpening statement \n'My mother feels that bottle-fed babies gain more weight than breastfed babies and therefore are \nmore healthy.

While \ncircumcision may assist the uncircumcised boy who is suffering recurrent UTIs, \nroutine general circumcision of all boys is not indicated to achieve this, but can be \nselectively applied at a later age if this situation exists. \n~ Reduction in the incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV infection. \nThis remains a controversial point.

      "text": " \n074 \n003 \nPerformance Guidelines \n \nCRITICAL ERROR - none defined \nCOMMENTARY \nThis topic is one that has been controversial for many years. While circumcision for religious \nreasons has been done for many centuries, the issue in the scenario is related to the secular \ntrend towards routine neonatal circumcision of all males soon after birth. This has become more \nof a ritual rather than for any recognised medical indication, although this tendency has reduced \nin recent times. In fact there are many recognised complications of circumcision, not just routine \nneonatal circumcision, but circumcision at any age. However there are recognised medical \nindications for the procedure (e.g. established phimosis in boys and men). \n \n \n \nCONDITION 003. FIGURES 1 AND 2. \nCircumcision in ancient Egypt \nPhimosis \nMany young parents are unaware of the issues involved and are often ill-informed by family \nmembers who recommend that their infant should have the procedure performed without any \nexplanation as to why. They then request circumcision without any information about the \nprocedure and hence the need for informed discussion to allow them to make a rational decision \nin the interests of their baby. \nThis scenario illustrates that medical practitioners are obliged to provide accurate information on \nthe risks and benefits of routine neonatal circumcision and should attempt to avoid any personal \nbias. The decision should be left to the parents after a full and accurate discussion. \nUnbiased up-to-date written material summarising the evidence should be made available to the \nparents. \nThe review of the literature in relation to risks and benefits shows there is no evidence of \nbenefit outweighing harm for neonatal circumcision as a routine procedure. \nThe Policy Statement on Circumcision from the Paediatric and Child Health Division of the Royal \nAustralasian College of Physicians (September 2004) is recommended as an excellent summary \nwith 78 references to the evidence for and against circumcision. This is available on the open \nwebsite of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians under Policies (http://www.racp.edu.au). \n",

In addition, enquiry regarding features suggesting associated developmental \ndelay is appropriate. Given a working hypothesis of possible hearing loss, features in the \nhistory which could be causative, such as maternal illness in pregnancy, perinatal \nproblems such as jaundice or drug administration, should be evaluated. However, the \nimportance of early diagnosis and treatment of significant hearing deficit in this age group \nmake referral for definitive diagnosis mandatory despite no other concerning features \nbeing present. \nAdequate communication skills in dealing with a concerned patient are essential, used in \ncombination with appropriate knowledge-based clinical skills. \n",

Alopecia areata is a descriptive term for one or \nmore discrete circular areas of hair loss. These areas can occur anywhere on the body \nincluding the beard area in males. \nAlopecia universalis is where there is complete hair loss from the whole body and is a \nvariant of alopecia areata. The condition is a chronically relapsing autoimmune disease \nwith an extremely variable natural history. Patches on the scalp may regrow spontaneously, \nremain unaltered or enlarge and coalesce into alopecia totalis (whole scalp). \nIn a case such as this scenario, there is approximately a 33% chance of complete regrowth \nwithin six months and a 50% chance within one year. Approximately 80% of patients, \nhowever, will eventually relapse. If the hair loss persists for years, the prospect of regrowth is \ndiminished, although the potential for hair regrowth always remains because the hair \nfollicle is not destroyed. \nThe aetiology is unknown, but a family history is present in 20% of cases and there is a \nlinkage with other organ-specific autoimmune diseases. There may be a specific trigger \nsuch as a febrile illness or severe emotional stress (for example, the death of a family \nmember). Less severe day-to-day stress is not considered to be a trigger.

You contracted the disease from your older son aged five years. You are now \nconsulting the doctor about a painful and very tender left testicle. Analgesics (Panadol®) have \nhad little effect. The doctor has examined you and will now advise you about your condition. \nYou are in quite severe pain and feel most unwell. You are anxious about possible sterility (you \nand your wife would like to have a daughter), whether the other testis will also be affected, \npossible impotence, your infectivity (you have a wife and other younger son) and how long you \nwill be away from work. Be cooperative and willing to accept the doctor's advice if presented \nclearly. \nQuestions patient should ask if not already covered (the candidate's expected \nresponse is in brackets): \n• 'What is the connection between the mumps and this trouble?' (Doctor should explain how \nmumps virus is related to testicular problems — viral aetiology) \n• ‘What can I take for the pain?' (Pain killers that contain codeine compound analgesics) \n• 'Are there any antibiotics or other drugs for this condition?' (Not at this stage) \n• ‘Will it affect both of my testicles?'(Unlikely, usually only one is affected. Unless the other \ntesticle becomes affected, there would not be any expected influence on fertility. Sterility can \nrarely follow if both testicles are affected) \n• ‘Will we be able to have another child, if we decide to?' (Yes, fertility is not likely to be affected) \n• 'Will my sex life be affected?' (No problems anticipated) \n• ‘What will happen to the testicle eventually?' (Possibly reduction in size, but usually remains \nfully functional. Function of the other testis is usually unaffected) \n• When will I be able to go back to work?' (Depends on how rapidly the pain and swelling \npersists — about 7-10 days) \n• ‘Why wasn't my son affected in this way?' (Orchitis — inflammation of the testicle — is \nextremely rare in childhood) \n• ‘Will \nour \nyounger \nson \nget \nmumps \ntoo?'(If \nhe \nis \nimmunised \nalready \nwith \nmeasles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccines, he is at minimal risk. If he is not immunised, he is \nunlikely to contract mumps from his brother, but he may still be infected from his father.

Torsion of the testis need not be considered under the circumstances. \nA sympathetic and reassuring manner is expected. The candidate should indicate that the \npatient's anxiety over testicular function (fertility and sexual activity) and infectivity to his \nyounger child, are recognised and that possible reduction in size of the left testis is not \nlikely to be of any consequence to fertility. \n• Pain control — paracetamol with 8 or 30 mg of codeine (for example, Panadeine®, \nPanadeine Forte®). \n• Steroids can be used to relieve severe pain but have no other effect on the illness. Their \nuse in mumps is controversial. \n• Advise general measures for a febrile illness — adequate fluids, light diet, and rest, until \npain and swelling have subsided. \n• Local measures — scrotal support, application of heat. \n• Provide information about immunisation for mumps — live attenuated vaccine combined \nwith rubella and measles vaccines (MMR) is available. However, this will not immediately \nprotect the wife or son from patient's infectivity. Immunoglobulin is not effective. Mono-\nvalent vaccine is not available. Immunisation is advised for all children after 12 months \nof age, with booster dose before going to school. \n• The risk of infectivity to other adults is very low. \nIn counselling, the candidate should tell the patient the diagnosis, determine the patient's \nknowledge of the condition including any fears he may have, discuss these and reassure \nhim appropriately. \nKEY ISSUES \n• Confidence in diagnosing mumps orchitis. \n• Recognising  patient anxiety about possible infertility and  impotence and  giving \nappropriate reassurance. \n• Giving an adequate explanation of the condition including the infectivity of mumps, and \nits prevention by immunisation. \nCRITICAL ERROR - none defined \nCOMMENTARY \nMumps has the following associations: \n• The infecting organism is a paramyxovirus, spread by droplet infection or direct contact. \n• Infectivity is 50-60% (sufferer to unimmunised person). \n• Incubation period is 12-25 days (usually about 18). \n• Period of infectivity is from 6 days before swelling of face occurs till 9 days after, so his \nwife (if she has not had mumps) and younger son can still contract it from the father. \n• One attack gives lifelong immunity. \n \n085 \n",

If a colostomy is performed under conditions of elective surgery, it would \nnormally only be temporary. \nIn low left sided colonic cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival in \nselected cases. \nPreoperative investigations normally check for general fitness for anaesthesia, absence of \nanaemia and normal renal function. Abdominal imaging by computed tomography (CT) can \nprovide information regarding intra-abdominal spread as an aid to whether curative resection is \nlikely to be possible, and should be advised in this concerned patient to facilitate informed \nconsent for surgery. \nPerioperative prophylactic antibiotics can minimise infective complications of surgery. \n",

You should be reassured that the condition is not serious to your own \nhealth, but there are inheritance implications which will depend on your fiance's genetic status. If the doctor \ndoes not suggest testing your fiance, ask: \n• Will this have any effects on our children?' \n• Should my fiance have any test done?' \n EXPECTATIONS OF CANDIDATE PERFORMANCE  \nCandidates are expected to know that Thalassaemia is a recessive inherited trait so that the heterozygous \n(carrier) state gives Thalassaemia minor, whilst the homozygous state results in Thalassaemia major. \n• Approach to patient: \n~ This scenario deals with a sensitive issue, namely that if the patient's fiance is also a carrier, future \nchildren may be affected, with a significant risk of / β -Thalassaemia major. \n~ Minimisation of anxiety by careful explanation, a supportive attitude and with guarded reassurance about \npresent day management is expected. \n• Interpretation of investigations: \nThe characteristics of / β -Thalassaemia minor include: \n~ FBE — a symptomless hypochromic microcytic anaemia (rarely below 100 g/L) with decreased mean \ncorpuscular volume (MCV) and usually normal red blood cell count (RBC); \n~ diagnosis needs confirmation by serum electrophoresis (elevated Hb A2); and \n~ the anaemia does not respond to any form of iron therapy, unless the patient happens also to be \niron-deficient, which is very rare. \n• Initial management plan: \n~ Reassure the patient regarding the effect on her health. Iron therapy is not indicated. Oral folic acid of 1 mg \nper day will more than meet the requirements of the mildly increased red cell turnover. \n",

The underproduction of either alpha or beta chains results in a \nmicrocytic red blood cell. There is also haemolysis because the imbalance results in excess globin chains, \nwhich are oxidised and result in premature red blood cell removal in the spleen. β -Thalassaemia major is a \nrare, but very serious, congenital anaemia requiring lifelong transfusional support and patients with this \ncondition also need treatment to avoid complications of iron overload related to the frequent transfusions. \nThere is a markedly reduced life expectancy with devastating consequences for both the child and family. \nThe most important points being assessed are: \n• \nKnowledge of Mendelian inheritance (what is a recessive inherited trait and what are its implications?). \n• \nMeaning of \n~ heterozygous inheritance:  results in β -Thalassaemia minor; and  \n~ homozygous inheritance:   results in B-Thalassaemia major. \n• \nAdvise that fiance be tested for β-Thalassaemia minor \n096 \n",

If a thrombophilia is identified, \nanticoagulant therapy throughout the pregnancy and the puerperium should be advised. \n• Even if there is no underlying problem discovered, she should still be treated with \nanticoagulants at least during the puerperium, and it is safer to treat her throughout the \npregnancy. The treatment should therefore probably be started at about 14 weeks of \ngestation and continued until at least 4-6 weeks postpartum. \n• Optimal anticoagulant therapy is best given as subcutaneous low dose heparin in a dosage of \n7500 units twice daily, or with a low molecular weight heparin such as enoxaparin, in a dose \nof 20-40 mg 12 hourly (in the past it would have been common for heparin to be changed to \nwarfarin, in full dosage, between 16 weeks and 36 weeks, and then from one week \npostpartum). Treatment with warfarin, however, has problems such as a 5% risk of \nteratogenesis when given in the first trimester and an increase in miscarriage rate, fetal and \nmaternal haemorrhage, neurologic problems in the baby and stillbirth. For all of these \nreasons, warfarin is not used during pregnancy, although it is commonly used if treatment is \ncontinued postpartum. \n• Avoid prolonged immobilisation during pregnancy, and consider using compression stockings \nby day throughout the pregnancy. \n• Deliver in a controlled manner at about 38-39 weeks of gestation, rather than allowing a \nspontaneous labour to occur in someone who has just had her dose of heparin. Although the \nheparin dose is not full dosage, and unlikely to affect clotting tests, it is best to arrange \ninduction at a time when the morning dose of heparin can be withheld, with the treatment \nbeing reinstituted after delivery. \n• Take her folic acid therapy as on the previous occasion. \n \n• Ability to recognise that she is at increased risk of a recurrent thrombosis in her next \npregnancy and requires at least low dose heparin during the puerperium if not for most of the \nantenatal period as well. \n• Recognition of relative risks and indications for heparin and warfarin therapy. \n• Recognition of significant risks of warfarin during pregnancy. \n \n• Failure to screen for an inherited or acquired coagulation disorder. \n• Failure to advise anticoagulant therapy at least for 4-6 weeks postpartum in the next \npregnancy. \n• Advising warfarin therapy throughout pregnancy. \n",

Her haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) should therefore be measured and her \nblood glucose assessments reviewed to ensure they are satisfactory. It is particularly important to keep the blood \nglucose levels within the range of 5-7 mmol/L during the first trimester to reduce the risk of fetal malformation to an \nabsolute minimum, and during the remainder of the pregnancy to reduce the fetal and maternal complications \n(particularly macrosomia and unexplained fetal death). \n• Referral to her diabetic physician to check her general state is mandatory, with assessment for peripheral \nneuropathy, renal function (renal function tests and 24 hour urinary protein), and a check of her optic fundi by her \nophthalmologist. \n• Providing all of these are normal, she could be advised to attempt to become pregnant, and commence folic acid \nin a dosage of 0.5-1 mg per day from the time pregnancy is attempted until at least mid-gestation. \n• In addition, the routine tests which would normally be performed at the first antenatal visit are better performed \nprior to pregnancy. These tests should include blood group and indirect Coombs test, full blood examination \n(FBE), hepatitis screening, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory Test (VDRL). rubella serology, and midstream \nurine specimen to exclude urinary infection. If a Pap smear has not been performed in the last two years, this \nshould also be performed. Any abnormalities found in these tests should be addressed prior to the pregnancy. \n• She should also be advised about the care which is likely to be required during pregnancy as follows: \n~ Referral to a consultant obstetrician who will manage her in conjunction with a diabetic physician. \n~ Her insulin requirement will markedly increase and she will need to keep her blood sugars between 5-7 mmol/L \nto keep the fetal malformation rate to a minimum, and the macrosomia (large fetal size) rate to an acceptable \nlevel. \n~ The insulin requirement after delivery usually returns to pre-pregnancy requirements within 24 hours of delivery, \n~ Ultrasound examination should be performed at 12 and 18 weeks looking for fetal abnormalities, and at 32 \nweeks looking for macrosomia. \n~ Iron and folic acid therapy should be continued throughout the pregnancy. \n~ In general, even where the diabetes is well controlled, delivery should be planned for 38-40 weeks in someone \nwho has had diabetes for 15 years and is on insulin therapy. Earlier delivery might be necessary if problems \noccur during the pregnancy. \n~ Despite adequate monitoring and care during pregnancy, the pregnancy is more likely to be complicated by \npre-eclampsia, polyhydramnios and macrosomia of the fetus. There is also an increased risk of unexplained \nfetal death-in-utero late in pregnancy and of respiratory distress in the baby after delivery.

Termination of the pregnancy could be performed by using prostaglandins, or \nby the surgical procedure of dilatation and evacuation. This latter procedure has the \nadvantage of being performed under general anaesthetic with the procedure being over \nwhen the patient wakes up. This procedure is quite difficult except in expert hands, and \ncervical damage resulting in subsequent cervical incompetence in any subsequent \npregnancy may result when the procedure is done after 16 weeks ol gestation. \n• Prostaglandin termination may take several hours — or even days — and results in uterine \ncontractions similar to those experienced in labour, followed by vaginal delivery of the fetus. \nThere is also a possible need for curettage to remove any retained placental fragments. \n• Post-mortem examination should be performed on the fetus to check that no other \nabnormality is present that might influence the advice given concerning the successor \notherwise of any subsequent pregnancy. \n• The risk of recurrence of a neural tube defect (NTD) such as anencephaly, or spina bifida, is \nsomewhere between 2% and 5%. Folic acid administration (in a dosage of 5 mg per day) \nshould be commenced prior to conception and continued until about 12 weeks of gestation, \nas this has been shown to reduce the risk of a neural tube defect Ultrasound examination in a \nsubsequent pregnancy is imperative. \n• Maternal serum alpha fetoprotein assessment is also useful as a screening test and should \nbe performed at about 16 weeks of gestation in any subsequent pregnancy. \n \nAbility to advise the mother: \n• empathically of the fact that her baby has a lethal abnormality; \n• of the appropriate options regarding her further care in this pregnancy; and \n• of the methods available to reduce the recurrence risk of this abnormality \nFailure to: \n• recognise and advise the patient that this is a lethal abnormality to the baby: or \n• determine the preferences of the mother in respect to termination of pregnancy; or \n• counsel the patient appropriately concerning management in a subsequent pregnancy. \nThe most important aspect of managing this case is to understand the anxiety and \ndisappointment of the mother.

This test would be appropriate to assess the \nlikelihood of a chromosome abnormality but an alpha-fetoprotein assessment at 15-16 weeks \ngestation is also necessary for recognition of a likely NTD. Earlier ultrasound examination, at \n11-12 weeks of gestation, may allow a diagnosis of anencephaly to be made, but would not \nexclude spina bifida.

You have had dyspepsia (epigastric pain after meals) for abo six weeks. Your \ngeneral health has been reasonably good apart from some rec generalised aches and pains in your joints. \nYou have been taking Nurofen\"1 table (ibuprofen), which you obtained from the pharmacist, which have not \ngiven much relief, i do not smoke or drink alcohol. \nQuestions to ask if not already covered by doctor: \n• \n'Why have I developed the ulcer?' \n• \n‘Is it contagious? Can my family members be affected?' \n• \n‘'What treatment do I need to get rid of this duodenal ulcer?' \n• \n‘'Would those NuroferP tablets have anything to do with this?' \n• \n‘Is it likely to come back once it has healed? If so, can this relapse be prevented?' \n• \n‘Is the ulcer cancerous?' \n• \n'’Would surgical treatment ever be required?' \nEXPECTATIONS OF CANDIDATE PERFORMANCE  \nThe candidate should explain that: \n• \nThe majority of duodenal ulcers are a consequence of mucosal damage caused Helicobacter pylori and \ngastric hydrochloric acid. The relationship of H. pylori a gastric acid to gastric ulcer is less definite. \nNon-steroidal antiinflammatory dru (NSAIDs) commonly contribute to peptic ulcer formation. \nManagement of peptic ulc depends on the underlying cause. For Helicobacter pylori-related ulcers, \ntriple ther (usually a proton pump inhibitor and two antibiotics) will heal more than 90% of ulc within one \nweek of starting treatment and, provided the organism is eradicated (u breath test at six weeks), the \nchance of ulcer recurrence is low. For NSAID-relat ulcers, the patient will only require acid suppression \nto achieve ulcer healing. \n• \nRecommended therapy for an H. pylori-related ulcer includes a proton pump inhib' (for example, \nomeprazole) plus antibiotics (clarithromycin or amoxycillin plus metr dazole given for 1-2weeks), \nfollowed by continued antisecretory therapy foruptoat of 4-8 weeks. \n• \nCessation of potential aggravating factors such as NSAID use and smoking is important. Whilst tobacco \nand alcohol may hinder the healing of ulcers, they don’t contribute to the development of the ulcer. The \npatient should replace ibuprofen alternative analgesia such as paracetamol. The bacterial infection is \nnot highly contagious to other family members. \n",

      "text": "016 \n109 \nPerformance Guidelines \n• Peptic ulcers are common, more so in men. About 70% are related to H. pylori. Left untreated, most ulcers \nwill spontaneously heal, but relapse, often after several months. Thus peptic ulcer disease can be a lifelong \nproblem, with about 10% of patients developing complications (bleeding, perforation or gastric outlet \nobstruction). \n• Most patients can be managed with medical therapy and without surgery. Complications of peptic \nulceration, which require surgical intervention, include perforation, gastric outflow obstruction and severe \npersistent bleeding. Malignancy occurring in a chronic peptic ulcer is uncommon (1-2% in gastric ulcer) but \nwould need examination and monitoring to ensure permanent healing. Haemorrhage from peptic ulcers \nproduces haematemesis and/or melaena. Bleeding is usually self limiting, but more likely to persist in older \npatients with arterial medial sclerosis. In these patients, endoscopic haemostasis using a heater probe or \ninjection of adrenaline, is often successful in preventing further bleeding. Surgery is indicated when \nexcessive or persistent bleeding occurs and should be considered when blood loss exceeds 3000 mL. \nHowever, each patient should be evaluated individually. \n \n• Knowledge of the usual medical therapy and risk factors for patients with peptic duodenal ulceration. \n• Understanding that surgery is required for perforation, obstruction and for patients with severe, persistent \nbleeding or intractable pain. \nWith the advent of the proton pump inhibitors and the identification of the pathogen Helicobacter pylori, the \nmanagement of peptic ulcer disease has undergone a considerable change in the last two decades. From \nbeing a chronic, indolent problem, frequently requiring surgical intervention, peptic ulcer disease is now a \nrelatively benign and easily treated condition. \n• Informing the patient that the duodenal ulcer is likely to be malignant.\nThe mucosal lining of the stomach and duodenum is normally protected from acid-attack and autodigestion by \na layer of mucus. This layer of mucus forms an 'unstirred layer' which is constantly replaced by secretion from \nthe underlying cells. Bicarbonate is also secreted from the surface cells to help with mucosal defence. Both \nmucus and bicarbonate secretion are modulated through the actions of prostaglandins, cyclic AMP (cAMP) \nand several other agents. \nThere are a number of ways in which the integrity of this mucous layer can be broken. Replenishment of the \nlayer can be interrupted through interference with prostaglandin synthesis and reduction in bicarbonate \nsecretion. This is an important side effect of NSAIDs. The layer itself may be disrupted and acid allowed to \ninfiltrate and damage the underlying mucosa. The most common mechanism of this kind of damage is brought \nabout by the presence of Helicobacter pylori. To survive in the hostile acid environment, this bacteria surrounds \nitself in a neutral zone, brought on by the breakdown of urea (through the enzyme urease) and formation of \nammonium ions. This change weakens the integrity of the mucous layer. \n",

FIGURE 3. \nHelicobacter pylori associated peptic \nUrease test on biopsy with sample \nulceration \nThe existence of H. pylori and its role in peptic ulcer disease was only appreciated in the early 1980s, mainly \nthrough the seminal contributions of B Marshall and R Warren from Perth, Australia, leading to their receipt of \nthe Nobel Prize in Medicine for 2005. \nOn a worldwide basis, most peptic ulcers will be related to the presence of H. pylori. Whilst the prevalence of \nH. pylori is high in many communities — especially amongst those in lower socioeconomic groups — the rate \nof ulcer formation is still relatively low. When a peptic ulcer is not related to the presence of H. pylori, the most \nlikely aetiological factor will be an NSAID. A great deal of false expectation occurred with the development of \nthe Cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (such as celecoxib), from belief that this class of compound would \nbe associated with a lower incidence of gastrointestinal side effects. This has not proven to be the case. \nIdeally, all patients with a suspected peptic ulcer should have an endoscopy performed. The aim of the \nprocedure is two-fold: first, to confirm the diagnosis; and secondly, to test for the presence of H. pylori. As part \nof the diagnosis, any ulcer in the stomach must be biopsied to exclude malignancy. Duodenal ulcers are not \nassociated with malignancy. \nIf H. pylori is present, part of the treatment will be to eradicate the infection. Provided this is done and the ulcer \nis healed, the chance of recurrence is low. If the ulcer does recur this is probably because the patient has \nbecome reinfected. If H. pylori is absent, the likely cause of the ulcer is an NSAID. Treatment consists of \nwithdrawing the NSAID and giving the patient an acid-suppressing agent for long enough for the ulcer to heal. \nTreatment for 4-8 weeks will lead to H. pylori eradication and ulcer healing in over 90% of cases. \nIf the initial ulcer was a duodenal ulcer, success of treatment can be judged by relief of symptoms and a breath \ntest to check for H. pylori eradication (if the infection was present in the first place). If the cause of the problem \nhad been a gastric ulcer, the patient should be endoscoped again, and the ulcer biopsied again if still present. \n",

Replacement of the red cells starts immediately after donation and \nthe slight anaemia resolves within weeks as the blood cells are replaced. \n• Blood can be stored safely for reuse within a few weeks (up to five weeks), so that one. two or more \ndonations can be collected over the weeks prior to operation. The blood units can then be stored and saved \nto be used during operation as whole blood or reconstituted red cells to replace operative blood loss \nrequirements in operations (such as this patient is having) on large joints or blood vessels, where blood loss \ncan be such as to require transfusion. \n• The procedure removes the risk of disease transmission (particularly by viruses) or incompatibilities and \nallergies inherent in standard homologous blood transfusion from another donor. \n",

Non-autologous/homologous blood transfusion itself is \nused to save many thousands of lives each year, and although not entirely free of risk, is \nrigorously supervised and a safe procedure in Australia. \n• Preoperative autologous blood collection for subsequent operative use depends on a verified \nand non-cancellable time for surgery, so there is always a possibility that the blood would be \nunavailable for use if the operation was inadvertently long delayed or cancelled for any \nreason. \nKEY ISSUES \n• Appropriate explanation of blood being a renewable tissue, thus allowing for preoperative \ncollection and storage including: \n~ advantages of autologous over homologous blood transfusion: and  \n~ circumstances in which autologous transfusion may be considered. \nCRITICAL ERROR - none d e f i n e d  \nCOMMENTARY  \nThere are two components to the task: \n• To provide education on the transfusion of blood and blood products. \n• To explain the benefits, risks and principles of autologous blood transfusion. \nIn industrialised communities, blood transfusion is now extremely safe. Blood is usually collected \nfrom volunteer donors only. In Australia there is no remuneration or any form of inducement other \nthan a demonstration of community spirit. All blood samples are carefully screened for important \ncommunicable diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C virus \n(HBV, HCV) and syphilis. There will always be a risk of infection and of concern is the rare \nhepatitis G virus and the prion transmission agent responsible for Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease \n(CJD). Some countries will not accept donors who have come from countries where 'mad cow' \ndisease has been identified. Screening for HIV does not give absolute freedom from risk, as a \nwindow period occurs after primary infection until antigen is detectable and seroconversion \noccurs after several weeks. \nBlood is only given to patients when strictly necessary. Donors are screened for high risk \ncircumstances and the donated blood tested, and the blood is grouped, screened for antibodies \nand cross-matched with the potential recipient. There are strict guidelines for the administration \nand monitoring of blood and any adverse events are documented and reported. Blood \ntransfusion is used sparingly for elective surgery and otherwise healthy patients can tolerate \nhaemoglobin concentrations down to 80 g/L. \n",

      "text": "113 \n017 \nPerformance Guidelines \n \n \n \nAutologous transfusion is only considered when: \n• the date of the surgical procedure can be virtually guaranteed: \n• the patient's haemoglobin concentration exceeds 110 g/L (135 g/L in women); and \n• it is likely that a substantial amount of blood will be lost during the procedure. \nConcerns about the safety of blood transfusion, particularly in the 1980s about risks of transmission of HIV \ninfection, stimulated interest in avoiding or reducing the use of donor blood, particularly single unit transfusions \n(Give blood by the gallon, not by the gill). \nSeveral techniques can be used to avoid the need for bank blood. \nAutologous blood transfusion is one such technique, which reduces the risk of transfusion of viral infection \nand also of alloimmunisation and incompatibility reactions. \nStored blood at 4\"C has a 'shelf-life' of up to five weeks, at which time around 70% of the red cells still survive \nnormally. \nWith pre-deposit autologous transfusion, patients can donate 2-5 units (of450mL) at approximately weekly \nintervals before elective surgery. Alternatively, deliberate preoperative haemodilution can be induced by \nremoving one or two units immediately before surgery to be used during surgery to replace operative losses. \nCollection and administration of blood for autologous transfusion is an expensive exercise. Because the donor \n(the patient) is not a standard blood donor, if the blood is not used for any reason, it cannot be put into the \ngeneral donor pool and will be wasted. Starting a maximum of five weeks before the planned procedure, the \npatient donates a unit (450 mL) a week and is given ferrous sulphate supplements. Another variant on \nautotransfusion, as noted above, is to take off 1 L of blood immediately prior to operation, haemodiiute the \npatient with crystalloid and then use the freshly removed blood as required. \nOther techniques that can be used include intraoperative autotransfusion (operative \nblood salvage) and erythropoietin. Blood salvage techniques to collect and retransfuse blood lost during \nsurgery can be employed, providing the operative site is known to be free of bacteria, intestinal content, or \ntumour. Intraoperative autotransfusion can be used in major trauma and vascular surgery. As the equipment \nrequired to run such systems is expensive, intraoperative autotransfusion does not usually make significant \ndollar savings over standard banked blood. \nRecombinant human erythropoietin can be used to stimulate the body's own blood reserves prior to elective \nsurgery. The technique can be considered for chronic renal failure patients who are anaemic and as a \nblood-saving strategy in major surgery. \nIn Australia and UK. where blood transfusion is generally perceived as being safe, and where emergency \nsurgery and pressures and operating list revisions make it difficult to set definite dates of elective surgery, the \ntechniques of autologous transfusion are applied only in a minority of cases. This contrasts to other \ncommunities, such as USA. where the use of autologous transfusion is more common (up to 5% in some \nregions). \nThe future: The use of allogenic blood will always involve the need for compatibility testing. The shelf life of \nallogenic blood is limited and although current techniques of blood transfusion are very safe, disease \ntransmission from viruses is unlikely to be completely eliminated because of false negative results during the \nwindow period. \nA clinically effective red blood cell substitute would thus be beneficial in terms of universal compatibility, \nimmediate availability, freedom of disease transmission, and long-term storage. \nMajor potential candidates are haemoglobin solutions and perfluorochemical emulsions. \n",

      "text": "018 \nPerformance Guidelines \n116 \nEXPECTATIONS OF CANDIDATE PERFORMANCE \nThe candidate should display appropriate empathy, rapport and enthusiasm for explaining the \nbenefits and pitfalls of smoking cessation. \nCigarette dependence is a chronic relapsing condition which, once established, involves a long \nterm, even lifetime struggle to achieve abstinence. Motivation to stop in this patient should be \nassessed by the candidate asking direct questions about his intentions and desire to stop (for \nexample, on a scale from 'not at all' to Very much'). The patient is in the preparation' stage of \nbehaviour change (planning to stop in the near future) and is hoping to learn 'action' strategies \nthat will help him succeed in overcoming his dependence on nicotine. \nIn order to assess how dependent the patient is on nicotine, the candidate should not only ask \nabout the number of cigarettes a day the patient smokes, but focus more on the pattern of \nsmoking during the day (smoking more in the first hours of waking is more significant and \nsuggests a greater degree of dependence). \nQuestions which would be appropriate from the candidate to the patient are: \n• 'How many cigarettes a day do you smoke?\n1 \n• ‘How soon after you wake up do you have your first cigarette?' \n• 'Do you find it difficult not to smoke in nonsmoking areas?' \n• ‘Is the first cigarette of the day the hardest to give up?' \n• ‘'What is your pattern of smoking during the day?' \n• 'Do you smoke even if you are so ill that you cannot get out of bed?' \n• ‘Have you tried to stop smoking for good in the past but found you could not?' \nThe patient's answers to these questions will shape the advice that the candidate then gives. A \n'yes ' response to the last question suggests that the patient will need help to stop smoking. When \na patient smokes 20 or more cigarettes/day and has to have the first smoke within half an hour of \nwaking up then the patient is likely to benefit from nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or \nbupropion. \nADVICE ON NICOTINE WITHDRAWAL \nWithin 24 hours of reducing or stopping nicotine intake you may experience: \n• depression or otherwise feeling unwell; \n• insomnia; \n• restlessness and irritability; \n• anxiety and difficulty concentrating; \n• drop in heart rate over time; \n• increase in appetite so that you may gain up to 3 kg over the next 12 months: \n• cravings for sweet things; and \n• cravings for cigarettes. \nAbout 5% of nicotine-dependent individuals can stop smoking unaided and less than 25% of \npeople succeed at their first attempt to quit. Overall the successful quit rate is about 45% \neventually. \nWithdrawal symptoms: \n• peak in intensity over the first four days of abstinence; \n• most residual symptoms improve significantly within a month; \n• hunger and weight gain may persist for a year or so. \n",

Candidates should have a broad knowledge \nof the content, and are expected to be aware of, and incorporate most of. the following key \nelements into their counselling. \nKEY ELEMENTS OF CIGARETTE/NICOTINE WITHDRAWAL PROGRAMME \nThe key elements of a cigarette/nicotine withdrawal programme include: \n• Set a definite QUIT BY date (within two weeks of making the decision to quit). \n• Aim for total abstinence — not just 'cutting down'. \n• Review previous attempts at quitting and what went wrong! \n• Inform family and friends, particularly other smokers, of the plan, \n \n• Avoid alcohol, which is an important trigger for smoking, and similarly review coffee intake. \n• Anticipate and discuss likely individual pitfalls and difficulties (for example, weight gain or \ndepression). \n• Practise problem solving as a way of dealing with 'what do I do if/when'. \n• Encourage the use of nicotine replacement therapy unless there are contraindications (e.g. \ncoronary artery disease or pregnancy). \n• Recommend starting or increasing physical activity and the importance of a balanced diet. \n• Schedule followup visits and supportive phone calls. \nNICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY (NRT) \nThe aim of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is mainly to ameliorate nicotine withdrawal. \nNeither patches nor gum give the arterial 'high' concentration of cigarettes and the overall dose of \nnicotine they provide is about 40% of that provided by cigarettes, but they are not accompanied \nby tar. carcinogens or carbon monoxide. Smokers extract about 1 mg of nicotine per cigarette \nindependent of the brand used, although each cigarette may contain up to 14 mg of nicotine. \nCosts of NRT may influence patient choice, but are generally cheaper than continuing to smoke. \nForms of NRT include: \n• NICOTINE GUM contains nicotine 2 or 4 mg per piece in a sugar-free resin base. The gum \nshould be chewed slowly, then left between cheek and gum before being repositioned and \nchewed intermittently for up to 30 minutes, 10 times a day. Because nicotine is poorly \nabsorbed from an acid environment, acid drinks such as fruit juice should be avoided. Mouth \nsoreness or dyspepsia may occur. Lozenges are an alternative. \n",

They are designed to release \nnicotine slowly through the adhesive layer of the patch to the skin and hence into the circulation.

The initial strength of nicotine dosage will depend on severity of \ndependence as well as average daily intake of nicotine from cigarettes. \nWhilst NRT is effective by itself in achieving abstinence, behavioural support from the doctor, family and \nfriends will increase the success rate. \nOTHER SMOKING CESSATION STRATEGIES AND AIDS INCLUDE: \n• \nBupropion (slow-release — Zyban®) is an atypical antidepressant with both noradrenergic and \ndopaminergic activity. \n~ Mechanism of action as an aid to smoking cessation is not related to its antidepressant action, but to \ncommon addiction pathways. \n~ Treatment starts at 150 mg/day for the first three days and then increases to 150 mg twice daily. \n~ The standard treatment period is nine weeks which is subsidised under the Pharmaceutical Benefit \nScheme in Australia. Maintenance may last a further six months. \n~ Nausea, insomnia and dry mouth are the commonest early side effects. \n- Bupropion is absolutely contraindicated in patients with a history of epilepsy: and is relatively        \ncontraindicated when there is a history of Type 1 or 2 diabetes.  \n~ It must not be prescribed during pregnancy. \n~ Sustained-release bupropion has been shown to be efficacious in producing abstinence in cigarette \nsmokers either with or without adjunctive psychological interventions. \n• \nClonidine is uncommonly used to moderate withdrawal symptoms. \n• \nNortriptyline 10 mg/day has also been trialled as an alternative to bupropion. \n• \nPamphlets, stickers, badges and audiovisual and multimedia tapes in different languages are available \nthrough the various state health departments, which can supplement face-to-face counselling. \n",

One in two lifetime smokers will die from their \naddiction. Half of these deaths will occur in middle age. Quitting at any age will give \nmajor health benefits and reduce your risk of tobacco related illnesses. With planning \nand determination you can quit and stay a non-smoker. \nHealth effects of smoking \nTobacco smoke contains more than 4,000 \nchemicals, Harmful ones include: \n• Nicotine - is an addictive drug and can make it \nhard, but not impossible, to quit. It also affects \nvour heart rate and blood pressure. \n• Carbon monoxide - replaces some of the oxygen \nin your blood, leaving your muscles, heart and \nbrain with less oxygen. \n• Tar - contains many cancer causing chemicals. \nLower tar or 'light' cigarettes are not any better \nas you are likely to take deeper putts, more \noften, to get the amount of nicotine you need. \nSmoking increases the risk of cancer, heart disease, \nstroke and lung disease. It affects fertility levels in \nmen and women and can lead to impotency in \nmen, and miscarriage and complications in \npregnancy and labour. Smoking affects your \nimmune system and is ■ cause of many other \nconditions such as blindness and osteoporosis. \nHarm to others \nEnvironmental tobacco smoke comes from both the \nburning end of a cigarette and from the smoke \nbreathed out by a smoker. This harms not just the   \njjf smoker, but also family members and \ncoworkers. Passive smoking causes heart disease \nand lung cancer in non-smokers living with \nsmokers. \nChildren exposed to passive smoking are more \nlikely to suffer from health problems including \nasthma, meningococcal disease, coughs and chest \ninfections. Smoking by the mother is a major risk \nfactor for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS or \n'cot death). \nDo you know why you want to \nstop smoking? \nIt's important to be clear about your reasons. These \nare some of the best reasons to quit. You will: \n• Breathe, and taste and smell food better within \nweeks \n• Improve vour circulation, immune system and \nthe health of your heart and lungs \n• Have fewer days of illness and fewer health \ncomplaints than continuing smokers \n• Provide a positive example for children and \nothers \n• Save money, a minimum of $2300 per year for a \npack a day habit. \nBefore you quit \nChemicals in cigarettes change the way \nsome medications work. We know that \nstopping smoking can be Ï     stressful. So if \nvou have suffered from depression, anxiety \nor other mental illness, and/or are taking \nmedication, speak to your doctor before \nquitting. \nPharmacy Serf Care is a program \nof the Pharmaceutical \nSociety of Australia \nCONDITION 018.

You have been a regular, now daily, drinker for many years, but you considered yourself \nto be an 'average drinker' for your personal situation in life. \nYou consulted this doctor two days ago. The doctor enquired about your use of alcohol and \nother concerns at length, and then examined you. The doctor said your use of alcohol was of \nconcern and asked you to have some blood tests. You have returned today to discuss the \nresults. \nYou should be rather passive, exhibiting acceptance of the doctor's advice, while showing a \ncontemplative demeanour that suggests that you may not have made up your mind about \nmodifying or stopping your alcohol intake. \nEXPECTATIONS OF CANDIDATE PERFORMANCE \nThe candidate's approach to the patient should be nonjudgmental and supportive.

The questions chosen are similar to those asked by parents who are \nanticipating the problems that they may encounter in the months after initial diabetic education \nand discharge from hospital \nEXAMINER INSTRUCTIONS  \nThe examiner will have instructed the mother as follows: \nAs many candidates have a tendency to refer any question they are uncertain of to a higher \nauthority (for example, their registrar or consultant), you should not accept that answer, but ask \nwhat sort of things the consultant is likely to say about that question. \nEach question asked by the parent requires an answer from the candidate so that examiners \nshould keep a close watch on the time, and indicate to the parent to move to the next question if \nthe candidate is either spending too much time on detailed information, or does not provide the \nappropriate explanation. This will ensure that the candidate has the opportunity to cover all of the \nquestions in the allotted time. \nSatisfactory candidates will answer each of the following questions asked and cover most of the \nfollowing points. \nQuestions to be asked by the mother (in this order) \nOpening Statement \n'Will he need insulin injections each day from now on?' \nIf the candidate indicates (correctly) that the child will require daily insulin, ask how often and \nthen ask \n'Who is going to be giving Roger's insulin from now on?' \n‘How do I assess the day to day control of his diabetes?' \n'What do I need to do about his school?' \n'Will he be able to go to school camps?

At this age it is usually inappropriate for children to be on basal/bolus insulin regimen. \nThis is best left until teenage and when the child is ready to accept four injections per day. \nQ 2 Who injects? \nThe candidate should advise that both parents if available, and perhaps an older sibling, should \nlearn the injection technique in case of parental sickness or absence. Similarly they should \nunderstand how and when to give glucagon. Candidates should indicate that the Paediatric Unit \nstaff and educators will ensure that parents are confident of drawing up and administering \ninsulin before discharge, and if necessary will arrange help at home from the District Nursing \nService after discharge. \nQ 3 Monitoring? \nThe candidate should indicate that blood sugar levels are monitored several times daily by a \nglucometer (illustrated), the details of which will be shown to the parent. These levels are \nusually assessed before each meal and before bed at night. This allows the clinician and the \nparent, when confident, to be able to review the blood sugar levels and to recognise if an \nadjustment in the insulin dosage is required. This is usually adjusted based on a trend over \nseveral days rather than on a day-to-day basis. \nThe doctor should also indicate that urine testing for ketones should also be done if the blood \nsugar levels are persistently high, or if the child is unwell for any reason. \nCONDITION 020.

Similarly the school should be given phone numbers to ensure that the parents, the \nchild's general practitioner and if necessary the Hospital/Children's Ward can be contacted in an \nemergency. In an emergency most schools will contact the Ambulance service who will be \ncapable of managing the situation on arrival. \nQ 5 School Camps? \nManagement at school camps may vary often depending on the age of the child. With young \nchildren, parents are often encouraged to attend as camp parents and this would be appropriate \nfor this family if one or other parent is able to do so. \nManagement is related to the confidence and experience of the teachers involved and how \ncomfortable the parents are with the teacher's knowledge. The Paediatric Unit, in conjunction \nwith the parent will support the teachers by education and telephone support. Many camps for \nyoung children are held relatively close to the school district. \nIf the camp is in a distant town, supervising teachers with good clinical acumen are a \nprerequisite, but a letter should be supplied to a local medical practitioner explaining the child's \ndiagnosis and providing details of the insulin regimen, blood sugar levels and telephone \ncontacts. \nSome school camps have permanent staff who have children attend with a variety of medical \nconditions (for example, epilepsy and diabetes), and these staff are given special detailed \ninstructions as to the complications and management of these conditions. The parent should be \nencouraged to enquire as to the knowledge of the staff involved. \nThe parent should be advised that the aim of the treatment and education program is to allow the \nchild to live as normal a life as possible and Roger should be encouraged to participate in all the \nschool activities. This usually is possible; but the parent should be satisfied that the personnel \ninvolved are cognisant with the treatment for the child. \nQ 6  Sleepovers? \nThese should also be encouraged for reasons previously discussed. Sleepovers should usually \nbe at the home of a family who know the child and parents well; so that there can be a frank \ninformative discussion on the child's management, which is highly likely to be known to the host \nfamily. Similarly, this should usually be at a home close to the child's home so that if necessary \nthe child's parent may be able to call over and do the blood test as well as give the insulin in the \nevening and next morning, until the child is old enough and reliable enough to do these by \nhimself. \nQ 7  Sport? \nThe parent should be assured that there is no reason why the child cannot play most sports. He \nwill be excluded from some activities (for example, piloting an aeroplane). A good candidate will \nmention that insulin doses may need to be adjusted prior to active sport to allow for the increased \nglucose metabolism associated with physical activity. \n",

Most candidates \nshould be able to handle this discussion with ease and confidence by applying general principles in their \ndiscussion and this should comprise part of the overall assessment of the candidate. \nMost of the detail for this case is provided in the examiner's instructions. Much of the advice to be given is \ncommon sense in relation to the ongoing care of a person with diabetes and should not be a problem to the \ncompetent candidate.

(Reversal requires microsurgery, success uncertain. \nBecause sperm antibodies can occur, and these reduce fertility, even if the tubes can be \nconnected satisfactorily, success is not 100%). \n• 'Are there any complications?' (Wound infection, temporary discomfort, bruising, and \nhaematoma). \n• ‘Will there by any change in my sexual performance?' (No. not after recovery from \noperation). \n• 'How long afterwards can we resume normal sex?' (As soon as you are comfortable. A \ncondom must be used until the result of the postoperative sperm count is known; or wife \nshould continue to use the pill until the sperm count is clear). \n• ‘Does my wife have to sign anything^' (Preferable if both provide written permission). \n• ‘What is actually done?'

Obtaining this \nevidence requires the communication skills previously discussed in Section 1 Clinical \nCommunication'. \nGood clinicians organise knowledge so they can quickly retrieve and use relevant data, by \ngrouping knowledge into 'chunks',\n1 often groups of three items of information. In addition to \nrecognising diseases by patterns, they recognise groups of symptoms and signs, which have \nvalue in discriminating between one disease and another, or between one group of diseases \nand another. The alert clinician also notes unexpected variations from a common pattern. For \nexample, a child with fever is usually flushed. The child with an infection who is pale is \nunusual; the pallor may result from the circulatory insufficiency of septicaemia. Experienced \nclinicians gather important evidence early in a consultation. A number of cues are noted within \nseconds of meeting a patient. Where are we meeting? Is the \npatient male or female, young or old, relaxed, anxious, or \nunconscious? What else do I see? What is the opening \nsentence or two of the presenting complaint? The combination \nof verbal and nonverbal information, which impresses the\nclinician when first meeting the patient, has been called the \n'dominant cue'. It is the starting point for action or information-\ngathering, by triggering ideas from the clinician's memory. The\nmost frequent error in the diagnostic process arises from faulty \ntriggering. It is important to check what the patient means by\nwhat was said. \n \n \n \nWhen solving clinical \nproblems, clinicians tend to \nreview hypotheses either by \nsome form of rule, by \ninformally weighing \nprobability, by considering the \nsoundness of the cause-and-\neffect relationships of the \nevidence, or by a comb I \nnation of methods. \n'Framing the problem' is an art requiring practice to avoid going on a false trail. For example: \na 45-year-old man, who had an appendicectomy for appendicitis two years ago now presents \nwith symptoms of an acute small bowel obstruction. The most likely and most common cause \nis adhesions. In such instances spontaneous resolution often follows conservative \nmanagement. The careful clinician will ensure that less common but weightier causes — \nexternal hernia or colonic malignancy, which would require corrective urgent surgery — are \nconsidered and excluded. \nThe dominant cue may provoke urgent action by triggering a process of pattern-recognition, \nwhich is close to an end-diagnosis. This is essential in life-threatening situations. For example, \nif a patient presenting after a motor crash is gasping for breath and has a weak pulse with one \nside of his chest moving less than the other, then does he have \n \n1 Glass, Reuben D.

Pattern-recognition is also helpful in dealing \nefficiently with common diseases, provided the clinician remains alert for deviations from the regular pattern. \nExcessive reliance on pattern-recognition may lead to failure to consider diagnostic alternatives methodically. \nIf the dominant cue does not demand immediate action, further evidence is gathered. The clinician changes from a \nrapid, pattern-recognition mode of functioning, to a measured consideration of hypotheses. The first task is to \nelaborate details of the patient's presenting complaint and confirm that the dominant cue has been interpreted \ncorrectly. Then provisional hypotheses, which the cue suggests, are explored. Groups of observations may raise the \npossibility of related diseases. \nProblem-oriented questions probe a subject in depth when the dominant cue suggests that this is warranted, \nkeeping in mind the likelihood of a disease, and the value of treating it. Most questioning attempts to elicit symptoms \nto support a diagnosis, but the absence of a feature in history or examination may be of great diagnostic value. \nDuring the diagnostic encounter, the clinician is mindful of the events that have influenced the patient's life, leading to \nthe presentation for medical attention. Screening questions, to assess whether a problem may exist in another \nsystem or subject area, form part of a complete assessment. These questions reflect a doctor's style. In a full \nconsultation, the background of the patient needs to be known. This involves a history of past illnesses, enquiry about \nother family members, their health and occupations, and interpersonal relationships. \nRather than relying on question lists for system reviews, experienced clinicians choose questions that give the highest \nyield for the specific situation, collecting the most critical information early in the interview. They structure data, \nprocessing a limited amount of information at one time in meaningful packets. It is often helpful to summarise the \nevents that led to the patient's presentation for medical attention, and to repeat this concisely to the patient. \nThis helps to ensure that the clinician understands what the patient meant by what he said, For example, the patient \nmay have said 7 seem to have peed an awful lot lately'. The clinician may summarise this as 'you have been \nconcerned about passing large amounts of urine'; and the patient may respond lno, I don't do much, it's just I have to \ngo often'. By repeating the information in unambiguous but nontechnical language to the patient, this clinician has \navoided the traps of incorrectly mentally coding the dominant cue as 'polyuria instead of 'frequency'. On other \noccasions, the clinician's summary may trigger a further comment from the patient, about some important item that \nwas not mentioned. \nIf the situation does not require immediate action, the clinician usually develops a number of hypotheses — often \nthree — about how the patient's symptoms might be explained. Thus abdominal pain may be due to an \nintra-abdominal cause, or result from referred pain due to intrathoracic or spinal causes. The data is checked to see if \nit explains the various hypotheses. If so, the hypothesis becomes active; otherwise it is rejected. Beginners tend to \njump to conclusions too rapidly, considering one hypothesis at a time, until the evidence against it is overwhelming, \nonly then allowing them to move to another hypothesis. Experts 3onsider a number of possibilities and rank them. \nThis process occurs early in diagnostic :hinking. The ultimate refinement is called a 'differential diagnosis'. Early \nlists of hypotheses nay include some specific diagnoses (for example, 'acute appendicitis'), but are mainly ideas \nabout disease groupings (for example, 'intra-abdominal mischief). Compiling a set Df active hypotheses often \ninvolves including some inclusive category (such as 'something \n",

Thus sudden vomiting \nwithout preceding nausea is unusual and raises the possibility of intracranial disease. Diseases have a variety \nof forms and their manifestations often do not follow the typical textbook example. Experience provides a \npicture of the variations. A common strategy is to alternate between questions aimed at confirming a \nhypothesis, and others aimed at distinguishing it from other hypotheses. Hypotheses remain active longer if \nthey include common situations, or if they involve 'high stakes' — that is, potentially serious diagnosis. \nLogically, this means that hypotheses favour readily treatable or remediable situations even if they are unlikely \n(though even more if they are probable). \nAs with history-taking, clinical examination can be divided into problem-oriented and \nscreening signs. Problem-oriented signs are best given in clusters, which relate to disease groups. Here, \nnormal, or negative findings can also be given in some detail. Less detail is generally appropriate in the \nscreening component of the examination. An outline of pathways of diagnostic and management planning is \nshown in Figure 1. \nWhen solving clinical problems, clinicians tend to review hypotheses either by some form of rule, by informally \nweighing probability, by considering the soundness of the cause-and-effect relationships of the evidence, or \nby a combination of methods. For descriptive purposes, consideration of each hypothesis may be divided into \nstages. To determine the probability of disease, the clinician needs an awareness of the prevalence of the \ndisease in the population, and the usefulness of the observation. Thus stronger evidence is required for \ndiagnosing a rare disease than for a common one. \nDiagnostic reasoning involves considering the value of items of information. Artificial methods can be used to \nanalyse the process. One method is 'revising the odds'. Before an observation is made, the 'prior odds' of \ndisease (chances of disease compared with nondisease) are expressed as a number or fraction. This is \nmultiplied by the 'likelihood ratio' (chances of observation in disease, compared with nondisease; or 'leverage \nof the evidence'), to give 'revised odds'. A simpler method involves 'weighing the evidence', where the initial \nidea and subsequent observations are given scores which are added. \nDiagnostic errors arise when clinicians confuse populations with differing frequency of disease. Malaria may \nbe the probable diagnosis of a febrile patient in a tropical area where the disease is endemic, but in a similar \npatient in a temperate zone, more evidence will be required to confirm that diagnosis. Hoof beats usually imply \nhorses, not zebras — but the odds require revision in Africa. \nIt is also important to realise that the absence of a feature does not necessarily have the same leverage or \nweight as its presence: the relative value of each may be completely different. Thus severe crushing central \nchest pain associated with pallor strongly suggests myocardial infarction, however, as this feature is absent in \nhalf of the patients with acute infarcts, the absence of the 'classical pattern' is of limited diagnostic value. \nSimilarly, the presence of a bruit over the thyroid is diagnostic of hyperthyroidism. The absence of a bruit, \nhowever, is only weak evidence against the diagnosis. Sometimes absence of a feature — a 'normal' finding — \nmay be of great value in differential diagnosis. For example, absence of anorexia or nausea is evidence \nagainst the diagnosis of appendicitis, though the presence of these features is of little diagnostic value. \nKnowledgeable candidates will highlight discriminatory 'normal' findings in problem definition, in contrast to \n'normal findings' on screening. \nThe need for action depends on the likelihood of a disease, and the value of treating it. Thus evaluating fully \nthe possibility of a rare disease that is amenable to treatment is important, although perhaps less important if \ntreatment is unsatisfactory. \n",

While information must be complete for the purpose of deciding management, \nit needs to be obtained efficiently. In deciding on patient management, two threshold levels of likelihood of \ndisease are important. Below the lower level, no amount of new evidence would suggest that treatment is \nwarranted. Above the upper threshold, no additional evidence is going to alter the treatment decision. While \nsome redundancy of information is appropriate when there is significant doubt or risk, unnecessary \ninvestigations should be avoided. At times, they may even be misleading.

Generally termed physiological jaundice, this is an adaptation process to \nextrauterine life that takes some days to mature. Most physiological jaundice resolves by the end of the first \nweek of life in full term infants and up to 10 days to a fortnight in preterm infants. \nWith such a common condition, guidelines are therefore required to determine what aspects of jaundice fall \noutside this physiological range. There are a multitude of causes for jaundice besides physiological jaundice \nand all must be considered before assuming that the jaundice has a benign origin. \nHowever, jaundice generally can be considered pathological if it occurs outside the above age range or is more \npronounced than expected. Usually physiological jaundice does not become obvious in full term infants until \nday three of life and by late day two in premature infants. Jaundice that is manifest in the first 24 hours of life \nusually has a pathological cause and this must be sought. \nThe most common cause for this in our community is a haemolytic process, usually ABO incompatibility \nalthough there are several other more rare causes of haemolysis that may also present at this time (such as \nhereditary spherocytosis and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PD] deficiency). Rh isoimmunisation is \nusually known prior to birth from the screening tests done on the mother during her pregnancy. \nThe other extreme of the natural history of jaundice is prolonged jaundice, that is. jaundice that persists longer \nthan the time when it would have been expected. There are many possible causes for prolonged jaundice \nwhich can usually be differentiated by whether the jaundice is predominantly unconjugated or \nconjugated, the latter often indicating a more significant aetiology, for example, biliary atresia. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1 \n",

There are, however, important \nclinical features that also would support this diagnosis Obviously the babies are breastfed, but are thriving \nand gaining weight well. Their bowel motions and urine are normal colour, a feature that must be determined \nwhen assessing these infants Physical examination, except for the jaundice, is entirely normal and important \ninvestigations to exclude other causes, for example, hypothyroidism, are normal. \nBreast milk jaundice is a benign condition, which requires no treatment except explanation and support. \nBreastfeeding should not be interrupted although some authorities indicate that the diagnosis can be \nconfirmed by ceasing breastfeeding temporarily and demonstrating a significant fall in the bilirubin level. This \nis rarely necessary and tends to give the message to young mothers that their milk is harmful to their infant, \nwhich is not true. \nThe cause is unknown, with many theories expounded in an attempt to explain this phenomenon, although it \nis thought to be due to a factor in breast milk that causes increased enteric absorption of bilirubin. The \njaundice may persist for up to three months but over that time the baby thrives and remains well.

Only around 3% of children who have had febrile convulsions \nsubsequently develop epilepsy, being mainly in the high risk group (positive family history of epilepsy, prolonged \nconvulsion, a focal element, abnormal development before the seizure). \n• \nCandidate may mention the use of rectal diazepam for recurrent febrile seizures, but this should be reserved for \nspecial circumstances and its use is not without risk. \nKEY ISSUES  \n• \nAppropriate questioning and history-taking. \n• \nAppropriate education and reassurance. \n• \nAdvice on preventive measures. \nCRITICAL ERROR  \n• Suggesting on the strength of this episode of a brief febrile convulsion that he has epilepsy. \nCOMMENTARY   \nIn this scenario, the dominant cue is the recognition of the change in sensorium in this child while he has a high fever. \nPattern recognition leads to the likely diagnosis and should allow the candidate to make a definitive diagnosis and \nbe confident in the advice given to the parent. The scenario tests not only knowledge of a common condition, but also \nskill in being able to impart a logical explanation in language that the parent can understand without causing alarm. It \nalso requires reassurance and confidence in the diagnosis. While epilepsy may be raised as a possibility, the clinical \nfeatures at the time, the normal appearance of the child when examined and absence of risk factors, make this highly \nunlikely at this stage. The candidate should therefore recognise this as a simple febrile convulsion with an excellent \nprognosis. \nA simple febrile convulsion is a common condition and candidates must be aware of risk factors that would suggest an \nalternative diagnosis of epilepsy should be considered: prolonged convulsion lasting greater than 15 minutes; a focal \nelement to the seizure; a family history of epilepsy; or abnormal neurological behaviour in the child prior to the seizure. \nAny of these features would throw doubt on the diagnosis of simple febrile convulsion. This is the process of \ndiagnostic reasoning. \nNone of these features is present in this child and hence the diagnosis is clearly most likely to be a simple febrile \nconvulsion. \n",

This is done by a careful history exploring the child's \npast history, current developmental status, and family and school situation. Monitoring progress over several \nconsultations may be required to give a positive diagnosis of ADHD. \nThe great majority of children presenting in this manner have major family dynamics problems and the scenario \ncould easily have been modified to indicate this. However the current scenario is designed to indicate that a \ndiagnosis of ADHD is by exclusion of all the other causes for this symptom; and that stimulant medication is not the \nimmediate treatment in this situation, a tendency for which has developed in the general community and is often the \nexpectation of family members who have spoken with neighbours or read the lay press. The doctor is often under \ngreat pressure to prescribe these medications at first visit and this should be resisted. \nThere are no specific tests available that make a diagnosis of ADHD. Diagnosis is made from the pattern of \nbehaviour, which can be confirmed by psychometric testing. While behavioural modification is recommended, \nparents have often already arranged this prior to the consultation, and also have often tried a variety of exclusion \ndiets that in some cases may be helpful, but overall are not. Parents should be supported to try exclusion diets if \nthey are keen to institute them; but the practitioner should monitor progress and make a critical appraisal as to the \nsuccess or otherwise of this treatment and support the parent accordingly. \n163 \n",

With \nadvancing age, the tremor frequency often slows and amplitude increases, leading to a coarse \ntremor which can be disabling, although this is uncommon. \nPatients with benign essential tremor often drink as a means of controlling the tremor as alcohol \nhas an ameliorating effect in 50% of cases. \nIn this case, the patient may also be suffering from the effects of prolonged heavy drinking.

The prevalence of \nsyncope increases with age and can cause significant morbidity in the elderly. An attack of \nsyncope is associated with major morbidity such as fractures and motor vehicle accidents in 6% \nof cases, and minor injuries such as lacerations and bruising occur in about a third of cases. It is \nessential to distinguish syncope from seizures and syncope caused by benign causes from \nsyncope caused by serious underlying illness. This middle-aged patient with syncope evinces \nthe triad of symptoms classical of aortic stenosis. \n \n• Failure to ask about cardiovascular symptoms.\n• Failure to request examination findings for both carotid and cardiac bruits. \nCauses of syncope include neurally-mediated syndromes (such as vasovagal/ vasodepressor \nsyncope and carotid sinus syncope), orthostatic syncope (including volume depletion, drugs, \nautonomic failure syndromes), cardiac arrhythmias (bradycardias and tachycardias), structural \nheart disease and cerebrovascular disease. \nTaking a careful history, including an eyewitness account, is critically important in syncope and \ncan prevent inappropriate and costly investigations. The history in this middle-aged patient with \nsyncope has the important feature of coming on with exertion and against a background of \ncardiovascular symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath pointing towards a cardiac \ncause. The absence of palpitations is against the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia but this could \nstill be a possibility on the history. The candidate is expected to use appropriate questioning to \ntry to exclude epilepsy and other neurological causes. Carotid sinus syncope and \nvasovagal/vasodepressor syncope may be considered as differential diagnoses but other \nfeatures of these conditions are not apparent (for example, relationship with head turning or \nwarning symptoms). \n175 \n",

HSV 1 and HSV 2 cause \npatterns of disease which differ clinically and epidemiologically, but share some characteristics. HSV 1, HSV 2 and \nherpes zoster all establish permanent latency in sensory nerve ganglia following the primary infection. \nHSV 1 is more common and is usually acquired during childhood presenting most commonly as acute \ngingivostomatitis, but can occur anywhere on the skin. In the eye. keratoconjunctivitis is a feared infection because it \ncan cause scarring of the cornea and loss of vision. \nHSV 2 is largely associated with genital infection and is most common in young, sexually active adults. The risk of \ninfection increases with numbers of sexual partners. Transmission is by vaginal, oral or anal sex. Condoms reduce the \nrisk of transmission. The infection appears at the site of virus entry, on the glans penis or penile shaft in men, or on the \nvulva or vaginal mucosa in women. Perianal and rectal lesions can develop as a result of anal intercourse. Primary \nherpes simplex infections have an incubation period of 3-6 days but this may be longer. \n",

You think you were born with it. The spot has \nbecome darker over the last few months so you thought you would have it checked out. You have a few \nother dark spots, but they have not changed. \n• \nYou are otherwise healthy and well, and have had no serious past illnesses. You have no allergies, and are \non no medications. \nOpening statement: \n'It seems to have changed and become more itchy lately, doctor. ' \nEXPECTATIONS OF CANDIDATE PERFORMANCE  \nThe presence of change in appearance and irritative symptoms in a previously stable pigmented naevus, \nshould raise concerns about malignant change, especially in a large lesion with appearances suggesting a \ndysplastic naevus. The candidate should refer the patient for excisional biopsy. \nKEY ISSUES  \n• \nAbility to identify a 'suspicious' pigmented lesion, possibly at risk of malignant melanoma. \n• \nAbility to manage pigmented skin lesions appropriately. \nCRITICAL ERROR  \n• \nFailure to suspect malignant potential. \nCOMMENTARY \nMost pigmented skin lesions are benign. About one third of melanomas arise in pre-existing naevi. Removal of \nsuch naevi is important for melanoma prevention. The incidence of melanoma is rising in Australia and around \nthe world. Incidence is higher in fair-skinned people; appears to be related to brief intense sunlight exposure as \nwell as effect of chronic exposure. \n",

      "text": "185 \n040 \nPerformance Guidelines \n \n \n \nMost people have an average of 5-10 benign melanocytic naevi. Multiple dysplastic naevi carry a greater risk of \nmalignant change. \nClinical features of 'suspicious' dysplastic melanocytic naevi include: \n• Large (> 5 mm) irregular moles, such as this patient exhibits, appearing usually on the trunks of young adults. \n• Lesions with irregular, ill-defined borders, irregular pigmentation, background redness, variable colours — brown, \nblack, tan, pink. \n• Most are stable and do not lead to melanoma, but excision is indicated if any diagnostic concerns. \nDysplastic naevus syndrome is diagnosed because of the presence of multiple, large, irregular pigmented naevi, \nmainly on the trunk. It is important to exclude malignant melanoma \nSigns indicative of possible malignant melanoma include: \n• any change in size of a presenting lesion (lateral spread or thickening); \n• change in shape; \n• change in colour (brown, blue, black, red, white and combinations of these colours); \n• change in surface; \n• change in the border; \n• bleeding or ulceration; and \n• other symptoms (itching). \nDevelopment of satellite nodules and lymph node involvement are late signs. \nDifferential diagnosis of pigmented skin lesions includes: \n• haemangioma (thrombosed); \n• dermatofibroma (sclerosing haemangioma); \n• pigmented seborrhoeic keratosis; \n• pigmented basal cell carcinoma; \n• junctional and compound benign melanocytic naevi; \n• blue naevi; \n• dysplastic naevi; and \n• lentigines. \nManagement: \n• In this case, the solitary dysplastic naevus may have no significant malignant potential at this stage. However, \nbecause of the size of the lesion and the patient's concern, this lesion should be excised. \n• Suspicious pigmented lesions should have complete excisional biopsy, and not be treated by cryotherapy. \n",

It also examines clinical reasoning \nabilities in understanding the potential causes of leg oedema and proceeding in a logical way to \naccumulate the relevant positive and negative features of the history in order to form a \nsatisfactory probability diagnosis. \nCongestive heart failure can present in a subtle way with symptoms of right heart failure, such as \nbilateral leg oedema, which is worse after prolonged standing and reduces with supine rest. As \nin this case, there is often a coexisting history of left heart failure symptoms, such as exertional \ndyspnoea. It is very important in a patient with possible congestive heart failure not to be \nsatisfied with this as a complete diagnosis, but to ask the questions 'Why has this patient \ndeveloped heart failure? What is the underlying cause? This will require an understanding of the \npathophysiology of heart failure. \nHeart failure is difficult to define. Various definitions include the following: \n• A pathophysiological state in which an abnormality of cardiac function is responsible for the \nfailure of the heart to pump blood at a rate commensurate with the requirements of the \nmetabolising tissues.' \n• A clinical syndrome caused by an abnormality of the heart and recognised by a characteristic \npattern of haemodynamic, renal, neural and hormonal responses.' \n• A biomechanical definition is that the failing heart exhibits a reduction of power such that it \ncannot maintain a normal cardiac output without abnormal elevation of systemic and/or \npulmonary venous pressures. \nThe underlying causes of heart failure are many and it is useful to consider these under the \nfollowing group headings: \n• Primary myocardial disease (ischaemic heart disease, cardiomyopathy). \n• Pressure overload (hypertension, aortic stenosis). \n• Volume overload (aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, ventricular septal defect, high \noutput states). \n• Obstruction to ventricular filling (mitral stenosis). \n• Restriction of ventricular filling (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, constrictive pericarditis). \n194 \n",

MOVE! FEEL! LISTEN! MEASURE! COMPARE! INTERPRET! \nThis aide-memoire comprises the seven champions of physical examination. Used in the correct sequence (and \nremember the above sequence, eyes first and foremost and only then fingers, hands and ears), they form the basis of all \nphysical examination techniques. Whether one is examining the whole patient, a focal region (head and neck, back, chest, \nabdomen, limbs) or a body system (integument, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neuroendocrine), an ordered, \nwell practised and logical sequence is essential. Sound technique facilitates accurate findings and diagnostic acumen. \nPhysical examination still matters and, along with a careful history, will confirm the diagnosis in the majority of \nconsultations despite the plethora and utility of available investigations. In preparing themselves to be good noticers and \ngood examiners of physical signs, clinicians should gain practice in: \n• Pattern recognition: the ability to define and group a constellation of features in order to diagnose, for example, \nshock, hyperthyroidism or cardiac failure. \n• Focused examination of an area or region such as a limb, the neck, the chest or the abdomen. Here one must \nconcentrate on checking features — normal and abnormal-of the multiple local structures which comprise focal \ncomponents of several body systems grouped at a common site. A sound knowledge of clinical anatomy is an \nessential prerequisite. \n• Examination of multiple sites and areas logically, sequentially and expeditiously to provide global assessment of a \nbody system (cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, etc) A sound knowledge of clinical physiopathology is an essential \nprerequisite. \nThis introductory segment and the MCATs following provide selected examples of these techniques. \nSkill development in physical examination is sequential throughout undergraduate medical education and extends into \nindependent and specialist practice. Like the acquisition of any skill, medical practitioners in their attempts to become \nskilled clinicians must: \n• have a good understanding of correct methodology; \n• assiduously develop the correct techniques; \n• have the right equipment and know how to use it; \n• know the range of normality and what constitutes abnormality; \n• be aware of the limitations of clinical signs, but use adjuvant investigations thoughtfully and selectively; and \n• practise, and practise frequently. \n \n \n196 \n",

Infective rashes are legion and \nrange through bacterial (impetigo, acne), fungal, or viral (molluscum contagiosum, herpes \nsimplex and zoster, HIV). Involvement of scalp or nails may occur (psoriasis). The distribution of \nthe rash (e.g. pretibial erythema nodosum) and associated features (e.g. focal skin ischaemia in \nvasculitis; central clearing in fungal lesions), give important diagnostic clues. \n \n \nSECTION 2-B.

      "text": "The mobility of subcutaneous lumps in relation to their superficial and deep surroundings is \nimportant in picking up infiltrative rather than expansile enlargement. The former is very \nsuggestive of malignant or inflammatory fixation and fibrosis. The lump's 'mobility' or fixity helps in \nchecking whether it is below deep fascia, attached to nearby bone or vessel or nerve, in the \nabdominal parietes or intra-abdominal. Most lipomas, 'sebaceous' and other cysts, ganglia, \nbursae, lymph node swellings, hernias, vascular swellings and other subcutaneous lumps will be \nreadily diagnosable if the above simple rules of focused assessment are combined with basic \nknowledge of local anatomy and likely pathologies. \n• Head and neck lumps \nWith neck lumps it is particularly important always first to observe the effects of movement: \nswallowing, coughing, protruding the tongue, and tensing underlying muscles such as \nsternomastoid or trapezius. Remember to examine the accessible nasopharynx and oropharynx. \nThe laryngopharynx and oesophagus are not accessible to your examining hands and fingers, \nbut remember the importance of endoscopic evaluation in the diagnosis of occult primary \nneoplasms presenting as neck lumps. With neck lymph node swellings always keep in mind the \npossibility of: \n• lymphatic spread from areas outside head and neck (chest and lungs, the abdomen or \ngenitals); and \n• focal presentation of systemic lymphoid pathology. \n \nSECTION 2-B. FIGURE 10. \nSECTION 2-B. FIGURE 11. \nHodgkin lymphoma \nNodal metastasis from papillary \ncarcinoma thyroid \nExamination of a cytologic aspirate will often clarify the diagnosis and point the way for further \ndiagnostic tests. For example, squamous neoplastic cells in a neck lymph node point to a \npotential primary neoplasm of skin, laryngopharynx, oesophagus, or lung, rather than from \nthyroid or stomach. Cytology may be specific for melanoma. If suggestive of adenocarcinoma, \ncytology commonly points to a lung, stomach, colon, breast, or testicular origin of the primary. \nCytology is particularly useful in diagnosis and classification of lymphomas. \nCareful application of the above techniques facilitates identification of the common head and \nneck lumps and their primary pathologies. The most common swellings will involve lymph nodes, \nthyroid, salivary glands, or developmental lesions (branchial cysts, cystic hygromas, \nsternomastoid 'tumour'). Rarer lesions include chemodectomas such as carotid body tumours \nand neurilemmomas. \n200 \n",

      "text": "242 \n045 \nPerformance Guidelines \n \n \n \nTest visual acuity \nThe term 'visual acuity' refers to the clarity of vision (from the Latin acuitas or sharpness). Visual acuity is expressed as \na proportionate relationship between the subject's vision and a person with normal vision. The subject is asked to \nread from a Snellen chart. The chart, with letters of different sizes on each of its ten or eleven lines, is placed 6 metres \n(20 feet) from the subject. \nAn individual with visual acuity of 6/6 (or 20/20 if feet are used) is just able to identify a letter whose height subtends 5 \nminutes of arc at the eye. Such letters are found on one of the lower lines of the Snellen chart. Acuity of this degree is \nreferred to as normal vision. Being able to discern letters below this line shows increased visual acuity and if the \nindividual can only decipher letters above this line, the visual acuity is diminished. \nA near-sighted (myopic) individual will have better visual acuity at close distance, whereas a far-sighted (hyperopic) \nperson will have better visual acuity at far distance. \nWith the onset of presbyopia, near visual acuity diminishes and reading glasses are required. \nTesting visual acuity \nVisual acuity is measured using the Snellen chart, displaying letters of progressively smaller size. Visual acuity is \nrecorded in the form of a fraction but it is NOT a fraction in the mathematical sense of the word. The numerator \nindicates the distance of the patient from the chart (e.g. 6 metres), and the denominator indicates the distance at which \nthe normal eye can read the line. Normal vision is 6/6 (20/20). \nVisual acuity of 6/6 means that the test subject sees the same line of letters at 6 metres (20 feet) as that seen by a \nperson with normal sight at 6 metres (20 feet), whereas 6/12 (20/40) vision means that the test subject sees at 6 \nmetres (20 feet) what a normal person sees at 12 metres (40 feet). Because the visual nomenclature used does not \nreprésenta mathematical fraction, it is incorrect to say that 6/12 represents 50% of normal sight. In fact, for legal \nassessment of visual impairment, 6/30 is regarded as a 50% impairment. \nVisual acuity of 6/5 (20/15) vision is better than normal 6/6 (20/20). A person with 6/5 (20/15) vision can see objects at \n6 metres (20 feet) that a person with normal vision sees at 5 metres (15 feet). \nNote that the Snellen notation applies only to distance vision. Near vision is recorded using font size, usually in this \ncountry the American point-type. Thus normal reading vision is N5 (5 point type). Newsprint is N8 (8 point type). \nLevels of vision \n6/6 — Normal vision. This is the visual requirement for a fighter pilot  \n6/12 — The visual requirement for a Driver's Licence in Australia  \n6/60 — Legal blindness. \nTesting should be done as follows: \n• The patient faces a Snellen chart at 6 metres distance. Formal testing requires a distance of 6 metres (20 feet), \nnecessitating use of a large room or a small room with a mirror to adjust for the distance. A 6-metre chart should \nalways be employed for formal visual acuity testing. Preliminary office testing can employ a 3-metre chart. \n",

      "text": "243 \n045 \nPerformance Guidelines \n• Explain procedure to patient: Start reading at top (largest) line of letters. If only the top line can be read, acuity is \n6/60. If the patient is unable to read the top line, the chart should be moved closer to the patient, 1 metre at a time, \nuntil the top line can be read. If the top line can be read at 3 metres, this is recorded as 3/60. If the patient cannot \nsee 1/60, he is asked to identify a moving hand, and this is recorded as 'Hand Movements' (HM). If unable to see a \nmoving object, a light is shone in the eye and the patient is asked if he can appreciate the light, and this is recorded \nas 'Perception of Light' (PL). If the patient can point to the light accurately, this is recorded as 'PL with accurate \nprojection'. If the light is not seen, the acuity is NLP (No Light Perception). \n• Visual acuity corresponds to the lowest line which can be read. The small numbers corresponding to the lowest line \nwhich can be read give the denominator — the distance in metres at which a person with normal vision can read \nthe line. In a line with 5 or more letters, the patient should correctly identify 3 letters to be regarded as having read \nthe line. \n• Examine each eye separately by using an occlusive card in a systematic way which includes asking the patient to \nread the lines backwards when testing the second eye. \n• If the visual acuity is worse than 6/6, the candidate should perform a pinhole test. Ask the patient to hold a piece of \npaper with a 2 mm hole in it over the uncovered eye. This manoeuvre utilises the 'pinhole camera effect' and results \nin an improvement in visual acuity if a refractive error is the cause of the diminished acuity. The patient should be \nreferred for refraction and prescription of glasses. \n• The candidate should give findings to examiner in the conventional way, normal vision being 6/6.

      "text": "244 \n045 \nPerformance Guidelines \n \n \n \nCOMMENTARY \nA comprehensive history and careful physical examination will provide a diagnosis in most common ophthalmic \ndisorders. \nAlthough unlikely in this case, the possibility of the patient's complaint of recent impaired vision being due to a \nserious cause (namely retinal detachment, glaucoma, cataract or macular degeneration) should be considered by \nthe candidate Ophthalmoscopic examination and the use of the pinhole test cover these concerns at this stage of \nassessment of vision. \nMyopia (near-sightedness or short-sightedness) is a common inherited condition which in most cases is due to the \naxis of the eyeball being too long so that the visual image is focused in front of the retina. Less often the refractive \npower of the lens is too strong. \nThe condition is readily corrected by the use of a concave (minus) lens. Onset can be in childhood, but more \ncommonly in late teens. The condition tends to worsen in early adult life and then stabilises. \nThe prescription: \nThe refractive error of the eye can be expressed in numeric terms. The power of the lenses necessary to correct \nvision is measured in units called dioptres (see below). The first number in a spectacle prescription designates the \namount of myopia (minus numbers) or hyperopia (plus numbers). The second number (if present), indicates the \namount of astigmatism. The third number indicates the axis of the steepest meridian of the cornea (e.g. +3.00/-2.50 \nX 170'). The fourth number is the additional correction needed to bring the focal point of the eye to the reading \ndistance. \nThe dioptre is the unit of measurement of the strength of a lens. A lens deviates light and the amount of deviation is \nproportional to the amount of curvature and the density of the lens. A lens of power of 1 dioptre has a focal length of \n1 metre (i.e. parallel rays of light are brought to a focus 1 metre from the lens). As the refractive power of a lens \ndecreases, the focal length increases. The strength of a lens = 1/focal length. Thus a 4-D lens has a focal length of 'A \nmetre. The power is a negative number of a concave lens (myopia, near-sightedness) or a positive number for a \nconvex lens (hyperopia, far-sightedness). \nThe corrective lens can be prescribed by an optician, although an initial assessment by an ophthalmologist is \npreferable to exclude any other cause of visual impairment, especially retinal detachment and macular degeneration, \nboth more common if myopia is severe. \nContact lenses can be worn to correct myopia, without the risks of surgical correction. \nCorrective operations (excimer laser surgery) can produce excellent results by altering corneal curvature and thus \nthe refractive power of the eye. This procedure is not without significant risk. Otherwise glasses will need to be worn. \nReading is not affected much until middle age. Myopia can affect the accurate measurement of intraocular pressure, \nand therefore intraocular pressure should be checked periodically to detect chronic open angle glaucoma which is \nasymptomatic in the early stages. This applies to all patients, and particularly to myopes. \nThe 'acute red eye', although not relevant to this case, is an important and urgent clinical problem. Most of the \ncauses of red eye (conjunctivitis, foreign body, inflammation ulceration, glaucoma and subconjunctival \nhaemorrhage) are associated with pain and/or trauma and can be excluded on the history alone in this patient. \n",

The incidence increases with age and is more \ncommon in manual workers than sedentary workers. \nA major problem in spinal assessment is the fact that there is often a poor correlation between clinical presentation \n(the patient's history and examination finding) and the imaging findings. Imaging abnormalities will be found with \nincreasing frequency in individuals with or without accompanying symptoms from their third decade onwards. \nBack pain, acute and chronic, is thus one of the most common of all conditions encountered but precise pathology is \nvery frequently lacking. The portmanteau and nonspecific term 'Mechanical low back pain' is useful in that it codifies a \nvery common condition from which almost all individuals will suffer at some time of their lives. In such instances the \nprecise pathology is indeterminable and no specifically diagnostic imaging or other test is available. \nBack pain may (or may not) follow an identifiable injury or strain as occurred in this patient Pain is usually \nself-resolving over a period of days or weeks, but may become recurrent, relapsing or chronic, and is influenced by \ncultural, psychological, socioeconomic and other personal factors in its incidence and persistence. Against such a \nbackground, it is hardly surprising that the condition and its preferred treatment remain controversial. \nThe outcome of physical treatments such as massage, manipulation, heat, light, sound/ultrasound, electricity and \nmagnetism (and surgery) are each difficult to separate from placebo and are prone to fashion and fetish. Clinical \nstudies are possible and literature search and meta-analysis can be helpful and reveal (for example) that laser \ntreatment of low back pain is free of concerning side-effects, but gives short term outcomes no different from placebo, \nand is expensive and not cost-effective. \nDistinguishing true radicular sciatic pain ('sciatica') due to nerve root compression requires symptoms of pain of \nlancinating or cramping type, extending usually from low back and buttock down the leg to foot and toes \ncorresponding to sensory disturbance within the dermatomal distribution of appropriate nerve roots (most commonly \nL5 or S1 ), exacerbated by straining or coughing, with positive nerve tension signs, and sometimes with objective \nmotor weakness and sensory loss corresponding to the appropriate motor nerve root. Such a constellation of \nobjective signs (as in this patient) is virtually pathognomonic and diagnostic of nerve root foramen compression (from \nintervertebral | disc prolapse, facet joint arthropathy or other encroachments on the relevant nerve root or spinal \ncanal). Confirmation of the diagnosis can usually be made by noninvasive imaging, of which MRI is the most accurate. \nPersistence of unrelieved pain after one month is an | indication of the need for a full history and examination \n(including diagnostic imaging), concentrating on the search for pointers of more serious pathology (malignancy, \nreferred back pain from intra-abdominal lesions, bone infections, or cauda equina symptoms such as interference with \nbowel or bladder control). \nThis case scenario has been chosen to exemplify the classical syndrome of nerve impingement radiculopathy, the \nmost likely diagnosis being compression from an intervertebral disc prolapse between L5 and S1. \n",

However, \nsimilar radiological signs or evidence of minor spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis are also present commonly in \nnonsymptomatic middle-aged or elderly people. \nMRI is the investigation of choice for defining spinal pathology when surgery is being considered. Surgery is, \nhowever, indicated in only a very small percentage of patients with low back pain and it is quite rare to \ndemonstrate treatable new pathology in patients with chronic low back pain, which has lasted for more than a \nyear. \nAssociated job dissatisfaction, depression, obesity and socioeconomic deprivation are commonly found in \nsuch instances. Long-term treatments with laser, shortwave diathermy, ultrasound, acupuncture, \ntranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, formal physiotherapy or chiropractic have not convincingly been \ndemonstrated to have other than placebo effects. \nThe effects of repeated image-guided facet joint, epidural or nerve root foraminal injections of local anaesthetic \nor corticosteroids are also disappointing in the long-term.

No concerning symptoms or signs are present which might suggest an \nalternative diagnosis. Parents need reassurance that the child is normal and that normal physical activity is allowed. \nReferral to a paediatrician/paediatric cardiologist is only indicated if parents wish it, or seem unconvinced. The \nconsultant would consider echocardiography. \nIt would be reasonable do to a chest X-ray and ECG, depending on degree of parental concern.

It is estimated that careful auscultation under ideal \ncircumstances will detect an innocent soft murmur in over 50% of normal four-year-olds. Hence medical facilities \nwould be overwhelmed if all of these murmurs were referred for specialist assessment. \nPrimary care physicians should be confident in distinguishing innocent functional murmurs from those that are \nassociated with an organic heart lesion. Rheumatic fever in our community is unusual these days unless practising in \nareas where large numbers of Aboriginal or Torres Straight Islander peoples are treated.

Proceed to your examination to ascertain the \nextent of injury describing your findings to me, the examiner. ' \nThe examiner will have instructed the patient as follows: \nYou have presented to the Emergency Department with a knife wound to the left wrist produced \nby an assailant after an argument in a pub. You lifted your arm to protect your face and he \nslashed your wrist with a knife. It bled a lot at first, but your friends reduced this by local pressure \nand the ambulance staff put on a dressing which controlled the bleeding, but which you think \nmade your hand feel numb. You are unable to move your fingers freely. \nSpecifically, you have lost sensation and muscle power as follows: \n• Sensation to touch and pin over the whole palmar aspect of your hand, fingers and thumb. The \nnumbness and loss of feeling extends onto the back of the fingers and thumb, over the nails \nand the end of the joint. \n• You should hold your hand as depicted in the illustration so all the fingers and thumb are \nstretched out straight. When asked to flex your fingers and thumb, you are unable to do so at \nthe end two joints of the thumb, and unable to bend any of the three joints of your four fingers. \nYou are able to stretch them out straight again if the candidate bends them forwards. \n• You also cannot flex your wrist (bend it forward), but are able to extend it (bend your wrist \nback). \n• If asked to put your thumb across to touch the other fingers, you cannot move the other fingers \ntowards the thumb (cannot bend fingers and thumbs inwards towards the palm); and you \ncannot move the thumb across the palm towards the base of the ring and little fingers. \n• If asked to do the movement of abduction of the thumb by lifting the thumb away from the \npalm, you cannot. \n• You can only move the thumb outwards and away from the other fingers in the plane of the \npalm. \n• If asked to hold a card between your fingers, or to move your little finger away from the others, \nyou cannot. \n",

      "text": "050 \n259 \nPerformance \nGuidelines \n \n \n \nCRITICAL ERROR \n• Failure to identify the combination of nerve and tendon injury. \n \nCOMMENTARY \nCuts to the wrist and hands from knives, glass breakages and other sharp items need careful evaluation to \nidentify damage to important underlying structures, particularly major blood vessels, nerves and tendons. \nOf the three main nerves of the arm (median, ulnar and radial), the median and ulnar nerves run to the hand on \nthe volar aspect of forearm and wrist, carrying motor fibres to the intrinsic short muscles of the hand, sensory \nfibres to the vital grasping surfaces of thumb and fingers, and autonomic sympathetic fibres subserving \nsweating and vasomotor responses. The median nerve, as its name implies, runs a midline course throughout \nthe forearm and lies in close proximity to the tendon of flexor digitorum superficialis running to the middle \nfinger. The important sensory and motor branches are given off after the nerves have entered the hand by \npassing under (median nerve) or around (ulnar nerve) the carpal tunnel. \nThe ulnar nerve lies more deeply on the ulnar side of forearm and wrist flanking the ulnar artery on the surface \nof the deep long flexor muscle (flexor digitorum profundus). Clearly both nerves were at risk from the cut \nillustrated. The superficial terminal branch of the radial nerve, by contrast, is at this stage a much less \nimportant nerve, with no motor fibres. It runs to the back of the hand and fingers along the radial side of the \nforearm, supplying sensation to the dorsum of hand and only the backs of the radial three digits for a short way \nalong their length. The ulnar nerve gives a dorsal sensory branch to supply the other one and a half or two \nulnar digits. If you extend your thumb and tense the tendon of extensor pollicis longus you may be able to \nfeel the terminal branch of the radial nerve crossing the snuff box superficial to the taut tendon by running your \nfinger along the tendon. The radial nerve is thus unlikely to have been at risk. \nTesting for damage to the other two nerves is usually easy and rapid with a cooperative patient. \nMedian nerve \nThe pulp of the index finger is virtually always supplied by the median nerve. Can the patient feel you touch \nhere (with a blunt pin, or wool, or your own finger)? \nThe pulp of the little finger similarly is supplied by the ulnar nerve, so repeat the process there to check for ulnar \nnerve damage. \nTo confirm your suspicions, now check the motor functions — the median nerve first. In checking for motor \nparalysis due to nerve injury, think of the muscles innervated by the nerve distal to the injury, find an action \nwhich is performed by one muscle only, check that action, and if possible, see and feel the responsible muscle \ncontracting. \nFor median nerve, abductor pollicis brevis (APB), the short abductor of the thumb, is virtually always \nsupplied by the median nerve just after entering the palm. You test its action by asking the patient to move the \nthumb directly upwards, with the palm flat, away from the palm and the other fingers, keeping the thumb inside \nthe margin of the index finger so the thumb pushes straight up against resistance. \n",

      "text": "260 \n050 \nPerformance Guidelines \n \n \n \nThat movement is palmar abduction. Only APB can perform it, you can test the power and you can see and \nfeel the muscle contract. The branch to the muscle is given off immediately after the median nerve enters the \npalm after passing under the flexor retinaculum. In patients with longstanding carpal tunnel syndrome with \nmedian nerve compression affecting the motor fibres as they go through the tunnel the muscle may waste and \natrophy as illustrated elsewhere in the book. But don't of course expect wasting, or the deformities arising from \nsuch wasting, in an acute injury. \nThe ulnar nerve has a much greater effect on the motor function of the hand than does the median — it \nsupplies at least a dozen important small muscles, compared to the handful from median (conversely the \nsensory loss from median nerve injury is much more significant than from ulnar nerve damage). \nUse two tests here — they will help remind you of the muscles involved. \n• \nCan the patient abduct the little finger away from the other fingers against resistance? This is done by \nabductor digiti minimi, supplied by ulnar nerve by its deep palmar branch. \n• \nCan the patient hold a piece of paper between outstretched fingers? This is done by the interossei, all \nsupplied by the ulnar nerve. \nThere are many other tests for other muscles supplied by the ulnar nerve — pinch test for adductorpollicis \n(Froment sign), the deficiencies seen in opposition (Sunderland sign), and so on — but further tests are not \nneeded, having already made the diagnosis of an injured ulnar nerve at wrist level or above, corresponding to \nthe site of the cut. \nIn cooperative patients, this is easy and conclusive — but supposing the patient was drunk and uncooperative, \nor stuporous, or a young child, and cannot or will not cooperate with you. \nIn this case you can still diagnose a nerve injury from effects on the sympathetic efferent fibres. If the nerve \ncarrying them is cut, they too will be paralysed, and the affected skin in the distribution of the nerve will be dry \nand unable to sweat. This can be demonstrated elegantly by sprinkling a starch powder over the skin and \nobserving the colour change. Also check if any differences can be seen or felt distal to the cut compared to the \nother hand — a small point but sometimes quite helpful. \nNext check for damage to the next important group of structures — the long tendons to \nthe thumb and fingers and the tendons to the wrist. These lie in three layers from superficial to deep. \n• \nThe wrist flexors: \n~ Flexor carpi radialis — the largest and most visible tendon  \n~ Flexor carpi ulnaris — the most ulnar sided  \n~ The inconstant palmaris longus between them. \nYou can check these by asking the patient to flex his wrist. If he can do so. he may of course be using deeper \nfinger flexors, which because they cross multiple joints, can act as accessory flexors of the wrist. In this \ninstance no wrist flexion is possible. \n• \nThe superficial and deep long flexor tendons to thumb and fingers. Flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and \nprofundus (FDP), each with four tendons, and the solitary tendon of flexor pollicis longus (FPL). \n~ FDS — This group of four tendons to index, middle, ring and little fingers flexes the proximal \ninterphalangeal joints. It is difficult to test their independent action becauseof the last and deepest layer \n— flexor digitorum profundus; these can act as accessory flexors of the more proximal joints, which \nthey also cross to reach the end of the digit The deepest tendons are prime movers of the most distal \njoints of thumb and fingers. \n",

      "text": "050 \nPerformance Guidelines \n \n \n \n~ FDP and FPL — Test the abilities to flex the end joints of the digits first — thumb index through to little finger. In this \npatient, no spontaneous movement against resistance is possible — all of these deep tendons have been severed. \nClearly given this finding, it is very likely that the more superficially placed flexor digitorum superficialis tendons \nhave been also severed, and you will find this confirmed when you test the ability of the patient to flex the proximal \ninterphalangeal joint (which in the absence of action of FDP is left as the only muscle which can flex the joint). \nIdentifying damage to the flexor digitorum superficialis in the finger is easy in this patient with a cut wrist, because the \nflexor digitorum profundus is also cut and cannot confuse things by itself acting as a flexor of the proximal IP joint. \nBut what if the FDP is not damaged? How can the action of flexor digitorum superficialis on the PIP joint be checked in \nsuch circumstances if the sole injury is to FDS? \nAnswer: To test the action of the superficial finger flexors in the presence of intact deep flexors is a difficult task and \nneeds a knowledge of the anatomical arrangements of the muscles, and in particular, the deep layer of flexor digitorum \nprofundus. Note that with fingers extended, it is possible to flex the index finger at its end joint independent of other \nfingers, just as with the end joint of the thumb. But to flex the end joint of the middle, ring or little finger alone is rather \ndifficult — the end joints of adjacent fingers tend also to flex, unless concentrating or holding them down. This is \nbecause, of the four separate tendons of FDP in relation to the muscle, the one to the index finger is virtually a \nseparate muscle (flexor indicis), whereas the other tendons are communally joined until just above the wrist \nThis fact can be used to advantage to eliminate the influence of the deeper tendons of FDP to these three fingers on \nthe proximal joint as follows — try this trick. \nHold down flat all fingers but one of a colleague, then ask them to flex the remaining finger at the proximal IP joint to a \nright angle as illustrated. By restraining the long tendons of FDP to the other fingers, and preventing their movement, \nyou have very effectively inactivated the remaining FDP tendon to the middle finger. You can easily check that FDP is \nnot having any effect by flicking the terminal phalanx with your finger — note that the distal IP joint is freely floppy and \nthe only muscle now causing flexion of the PIP joint is FDS. \nCONDITION 050.

The excision of \nher lesion should not be delayed, even though she would prefer to delay treatment for several \nmonths because they are busy on the farm. \nThe SCC and the BCC should also be removed without excessive delay. \nThe BCC only spreads directly, but local infiltration may be extensive, although this occurs \nslowly. The SCC spreads directly and mainly by lymphatics, and occasionally by blood spread. \nMalignant melanoma is the most serious of the lesions and spreads locally, by lymphatics and \nby blood spread. Widespread metastases can occur even from a small lesion. The risk of \nspread is proportional to the depth of the melanoma seen on microscopic examination.

Whilst basal cell carcinomas arise from \nthe basal layers, squamous cell carcinomas arise from the keratinocytes of the epidermis. \nSunlight is an important aetiological factor and solar keratoses and Bowen disease are \nprecursors.

Superficially is it attached to the skin and deeply what are the \neffects of tensing or contracting underlying muscles or tendons. \n• Is it a fluid-filled cystic lump? The most helpful test here will be whether it is transilluminable, a \ntest often inadequately performed. This test must be performed properly by correct torch \nplacement behind the lump and must be done by suitably darkening the surrounds — turning \noff lights and covering with sheet or blanket as required. When brilliantly positive, it gives \nirrefutable evidence of contents being liquid or gas. Gas cysts do occur in lung, neck and \nbowel; but in a subcutaneous site, the fluid will almost always be a liquid, and usually a clear \nserous liquid (such as in scrotal cystic swellings, bursae and tendon sheath swellings, or \nbranchial cysts) rather than pultaceous material or blood. A negative transillumination sign \ndoes not of course exclude a fluid collection as the cyst may contain a complex and viscous \nfluid, or may have a thick lining. \n",

Try \nilluminating the finger and areas of normal skin to see the extent of normal transillumination of fat \nand other tissues. Lipomas are not transilluminably separate from surrounding fatty tissues, nor \nare most sebaceous' cysts transilluminable, because the content is viscous or pultaceous \nkeratin. \n• Testing for fluctuation is often poorly performed also. The lump must be capable of being fixed \nby two fingers at the perimeter while a third finger compresses it centrally. If the other fingers \nare displaced and expanded symmetrically, and if this occurs when tested in several \ndirections and in planes at right angles to each other, then this again is irrefutable evidence of \ncontained liquid (by virtue of the incompressibility of liquids which causes transmission of \noutside pressure in all directions). Lipomas and other soft compressible solids may give an \nimpression of fluctuance, but they do not exhibit true fluctuation, merely effects of deformation. \n• Ultrasound confirmation and positive yield of liquid on needle aspiration are definitively \ndiagnostic of a cystic collection. In deeper lumps, such as those in breast or thyroid, where \nneither transillumination nor fluctuation is relevant or possible, these techniques become the \nbest diagnostic aids. \n• Is the lump vascular? Candidates should not omit feeling for vascular pulsation, or a \ntransmitted venous impulse, or listening for a vascular bruit or hum. Remembering normal \nvascular surface anatomy makes egregious errors less likely — such as missing an aneurysm. \n• Does the lump show emptying and refilling after compression or with joint movements? This \nimportant sign should alert the clinician to a possible bursal communication with an underlying \njoint and candidates should know which bursae are likely to communicate with which joints. \nTest your knowledge of the prepatellar bursa, the suprapatellar bursa, the pretibial bursa, the \nanserine bursa, the semimembranous bursa and a Baker cyst: all are near the knee joint, but \nonly some communicate with (or are part of) the joint synovium. \n• Is the lump attached to the skin? If this sign is unequivocally positive, the lump is very likely to \nbe a 'sebaceous' cyst or one of its variants, like a pilomatrixoma ('calcifying epithelioma of \nMalherbe'). This sign is sometimes easy to elicit and is accompanied by obvious skin dimpling \nor a punctum. But often, in areas where the skin is thick and relatively fixed to deeper layers \nsuch as on the back of neck or scalp, the test is equivocal and the clinician must rely on other \nfindings such as contour and consistency to help diagnose subcutaneous lumps, and to \ndifferentiate between lipomas and keratinous 'sebaceous' cysts. \nAt the end of the candidate's examination, or after five minutes, the examiner will: \nASK — 'What is your diagnosis?' \nASK — 'Is there any significant risk of malignant change?'JUe answer is NO for lipomas, \nsebaceous cysts, ganglia and bursae. \nASK — 'Is there any significant risk of infection?'

The onset of bilateral deafness in a young \nwoman during pregnancy is uncommon. The positive family history of a mother requiring surgery for her \nhearing loss points towards an inherited cause, namely otosclerosis. The onset of this condition is generally in \nearly adulthood and may progress rapidly in pregnancy. The stapes footplate becomes ankylosed in the oval \nwindow causing conductive type deafness.

      "text": "054 \n284 \nPerformance Guidelines \n \n \n \nThe eighth cranial nerve has two functional parts, the vestibular and the cochlear components. The cochlear branch \nsubserves hearing. Afferent cochlear fibres from the inner ear pass through the internal auditory meatus and enter the \nupper medulla at the level of the inferior cerebellar peduncle to reach the dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei. Fibres \nfrom these nuclei cross to the other side and end in the inferior colliculus. Fibres from that body go to the medial \ngeniculate body and the auditory radiation to the temporal cortex. It is important to note that there are bilateral \nconnections in the cochlear nucleus and above. \nSensorineural deafness occurs when there is damage to the cochlear nerve fibres anywhere from the inner ear to the \ncochlear nuclei. The most common cause is degenerative changes in the elderly. Other causes include a fracture of \nthe petrous temporal bone and an acoustic neuroma. \nConduction deafness is caused by blockage of the ear canal and by damage or disease of the tympanic membrane or \nossicular chain or fluid in the inner ear. \n• Establishing type of deafness — conductive versus sensorineural. \nHearing should first be tested clinically for each ear with the examiner's finger occluding the other ear. Few people now \nhave a ticking watch, so the examiner stands to the patients side and whispers numbers, which are repeated by the \npatient. \nThe meatus, canal and drum are inspected with an otoscope, retracting the ear upwards and backwards to straighten \nthe canal. This excludes other nonacute causes of conductive deafness (such as wax, osteomas, otitis externa, \nchronic otitis media). In this instance candidates will be informed that otoscopy is normal. \nDeafness may be due to impaired conduction of sound through a muffled middle ear (conductive or middle ear \ndeafness); or to a lesion of auditory nerve, cochlear or brain (perceptive or sensorineural deafness). \nA tuning fork of high pitch (256 Hertz or greater) is used to compare hearing by bone conduction and air conduction. \nNormally air conduction is better than bone conduction. In nerve deafness air conduction remains better than \nbone conduction in the affected ear or ears. In middle ear/conduction deafness, bone conduction becomes better than \nair. \nRinneTest \nThe vibrating tuning fork is placed on the mastoid, then at the auditory meatus: and the patient is asked which is louder. \nAir conduction (AC) is normally louder and is also iouder in nerve deafness. Hearing the fork louder on bone \nconduction (BC) indicates conductive deafness (BC > AC). \nAlternatively, put the fork on the mastoid until no longer audible, and then put it outside the meatus. The sound will in \nnormal individuals be heard again and will also be heard again in nerve deafness, but not in conductive deafness. \nWeber test \nThis can be very useful in unilateral deafness. The fork is placed on the centre of forehead in the midline; ask whether \nthis is louder in one ear or equal. Normally the sound is heard equally in both ears. Occlude one ear with a finger or ear \nplug, and the sound will become louder in the affected ear (conductive deafness). In nerve deafness the sound is heard \nbetter on the normal side. So in unilateral conduction deafness Weber test localises to the affected side, in nerve \ndeafness to the normal side. \n",

The shoulder joint is the most mobile synovial joint in \nthe human body. Protection is supplied by the overlying acromion and clavicle, and by the rotator cuff musculature that \nclosely envelops the joint. The major weak spot is below, where protection by surrounding muscles is less, and the \ncapsule is more lax to allow freedom of full flexion and abduction. \nThe common mechanism of dislocation is therefore displacement of humeral head from the glenoid downwards and \nforwards. The axillary nerve runs between the muscles immediately below the capsule from front to back and is \ntherefore at hazard from stretching injury in shoulder dislocations. The axillary nerve gives motor branches to deltoid \nand to teres minor, and supplies sensation as the upper lateral cutaneous nerve of the arm. It is important to test for the \nintegrity of the vulnerable nerve before reduction is undertaken and afterwards; just as it is to test sciatic nerve function \nbefore and after reducing a posterior dislocation of the hip (the most common hip dislocation). \n",

The patient illustrated has a reducible right inguinal \nhernia. \n \nKEY ISSUES \n• Performance of an appropriately focused inguinoscrotal assessment with appropriate technique \nand accuracy \n \nCRITICAL ERRORS \n• Failure to display appropriate clinical skills in diagnosis of a reducible groin hernia \n• Causing significant patient discomfort by rough technique. \n \nCOMMENTARY \nInguinoscrotal lumps are very common and present throughout life from birth to old age. \nThe history of onset of pain following a lifting strain and followed by a lump is very suggestive of a \ngroin hernia, and the appearance of the lump also supports this diagnosis. \nThe examination should be thorough but gentle. The groin area needs to be exposed and the \npatient examined unclothed below the waist. It may be convenient to start with the patient \nstanding, as small hernias are often made more prominent when standing. \nHowever, full examination and definition of all inguinoscrotal lumps is best performed with the \npatient comfortably lying; and with an anxious, apprehensive or modest patient it is best to start \nthe examination with the patient lying supine. Examination with the patient standing should not be \nomitted, however, as various swellings (such as varicocele, saphena varix) may only be apparent \non standing. \nInspection and palpation of the area enable one to answer: \n• 'Is a groin hernia present?'A groin lump with an expansile impulse on coughing confirms the \ndiagnosis in this case. The lump is seen and felt to expand uniformly and expansively when the \npatient coughs. The impulse ceases and the lump lessens or disappears when he relaxes. \n• 'Is the hernia reducible?' Check this visually and by feel. Always ask the patient himself to \nreduce the swelling before you try — in lumps of long standing he will be much more adept \nthan you! \n• 'Is it an inguinal or femoral hernia?'

It is endemic in \nAfrica, the Middle East, Asia and Aboriginal communities of Australia. More than six million people are blind as a \nresult of trachoma. It is a disease of poverty and the marginalised members of society. \nThe condition was known from ancient times as a contagious disease, and given the name trachoma (Greek), \nmeaning a 'rough' swelling. \nTrachoma is caused by an obligate intracellular Gram-negative bacterium. Chlamydia trachomatis. The disease is \nusually transmitted by direct contact or fomites between children and their mothers, or others involved in the care of \nchildren, and by flies. Poor facial hygiene facilitates spread by attracting flies and there are often recurrent bouts of \ninfection within a family. Recurrent infection will cause chronic conjunctival inflammation, which is followed by \nscarring of the tarsal conjunctiva. As scars mature, the tarsal plate becomes distorted and entropion (turning in of the \neyelid) develops and this results in trichiasis (misdirection of the eyelashes towards the globe). Chronic irritation of \nthe globe will lead to corneal abrasions, infection, opacification and finally, blindness. \nCandidates should be able to identify the stages of trachoma, easily remembered by the acronym FISTO — \n• \nFollicles; \n• \nInflammation; \n• \nScarring; \n• \nTrichiasis; and \n• \nOpacity of the cornea. \nFollicles are the sign of active trachoma infection, and represent the sites of replication of the causative organism. \nThe diagnosis of trachoma is confirmed by the presence of more than 5 follicles. They lead to scarring after multiple \nattacks (dozens). \nThe scarring of the deep surface of the lid distorts the lid and results in lashes rubbing on the cornea, which ulcerates \nand becomes infected and scarred. The resulting blindness is permanent. \nCandidates should know that azithromycin is specific for the causative organism Chlamydia trachomatis. \nThe active disease is usually seen in young children, with inflammatory changes most apparent in young adults. The \nscarring effects of infection develop in middle-age, when the patients present with trichiasis and corneal opacity. \nA simplified grading scheme for trachoma which can be taught to and used by community health workers, was \nintroduced by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 1987. \n",

Previously, the \ntraditional stock-in-trade of the astute clinician has been the manner in which his unaided clinical \nsenses of observation, hearing and touch are used in making diagnoses and in formulating \nstrategies of management. But times and clinical practice have changed. Investigations play an \nincreasingly important (though still not all-important) part in the practice of medicine. Major \ngrowth of special investigations has occurred in the fields of laboratory medicine and in organ \nimaging. The clinician in such instances often assumes the role of consumer, and must be alert \nto the possibility that an opinion given by another (or the data issued by a machine) is not always \nabsolutely reliable and may occasionally be wrong. This short introduction aims to give a general \nidea of the circumstances in which special investigations are essential, useful, profitable, \nredundant, or potentially dangerous, and to help in their choice and interpretation. \nPatients often assume that when a test is ordered, it will answer whether disease is present or \nnot. Clinicians sometimes make the same mistake. A test may be useful for helping to confirm, or \nhelping to exclude the possibility of a disorder, but will seldom give a perfect answer. A frequent \nerror is to suppose that a given test is equally useful for confirming or excluding disease, but this \nis usually not true. The clinician who orders a test should always be mindful of the reason for its \nuse. If the test result will not alter the patient's management, there is little point in ordering it. \nDiagnostic accuracy of any test will depend upon how well it performs in comparison with its \nperformance against another so-called 'gold standard'. The histological diagnosis of cancer is \nthe usual yardstick against which the performance of another less invasive test is measured. \nMore often, however, one must compare the accuracy of several available tests to determine \nwhich is best. \nTEST RESULTS AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS  \n297 \nSensitivity and Specificity \nThe performance of a test may be studied in a survey of a particular \npopulation. \nThe test sensitivity is the percentage of patients known to have a \nparticular disease, whose test proves positive (true positivity) The \ndown side of high sensitivity is a potentially high false positivity rate: \nthe proportion without the disease who also test positive. \nThe test specificity is the percentage of patients in that population \nknown to be free of the disease, in whom the test proves negative \n{true negativity) The down side of high specificity would be a high \nfalse negativity rate: the proportion with the disease who also test \nnegative. \nA frequent error is to \nsuppose that a given \ntest is equally useful for \nconfirming or excluding \ndisease, but this is \nusually not true. The \nclinician who orders a \ntest should always be \nmindful of the reason for \nits use. If the test result \nwill not alter the patient's \nmanagement, there is \nlittle point in ordering it. \n",

Sensitivity and specificity are epidemiological measures, \nwhich need to be adapted for clinical use. \nPredictive values \nIn considering individual patients with unknown disease status on presentation, the clinician wishes particularly to \nknow the predictive value of the test: that is, the likelihood of a positive or negative test confirming or excluding the \ndisease. \n• \nPositive Predictive Value is the proportion of persons testing positive who actually have the disease. (The false \npositives comprise the 'false alarm rate'). \n• \nNegative Predictive Value is the proportion testing negative who in fact do not have the disease.

Conversely, there is a very low chance \nthat this negative result will give false reassurance (0.2% false reassurance rate). It has a lower sensitivity (90%), \nand is much less useful in confirming disease. It misses 10% of cases with the disease and is more likely to be \npositive — and thus gives a false alarm — in patients without the disease (53%) than in those with the disease (47%). \n",

      "text": "299 \n2-C \nChoice and Interpretation of \nInvestigations \n \n \nThe ideal test should have absolute sensitivity — all people within the test group with the condition will give a positive \ntest result. \nThe ideal test should also be absolutely specific (the converse of sensitivity) — all people within the test group who do \nnot have the condition will give a negative result. If a test had a sensitivity of 1 and a specificity of 1 its probability of \nerror would be zero, and positive and negative predictive values would be 100%. With such an ideal test there would \nbe no false positives and no false negatives. The ideal test should also be attended by a very low level of random or \nsystematic errors of measurement. It should be highly reproducible: the error within and between observers should \nbe very low. No test absolutely measures up to all these ideals. \nBiochemical tests are based on results from a healthy population sample. These results will usually have a Gaussian \nnormal distribution bell-shaped curve pattern when plotted. Laboratory reports often imply that results falling outside \ntwo standard deviations from the mean are 'abnormal'. Such reports should be treated with caution, as by statistical \ndefinition, one in 20 healthy individuals would fit this category. A similar spread of results is obtained when examining \npatients with a particular disease. As there is overlap between the values in healthy and diseased patients, the choice \nof a cut-off point between a positive and negative test result is artificial. In such tests, specificity and sensitivity are \nlikely to be inversely related. For example, in screening tests for prostate cancer, a serum prostate specific antigen \n(PSA) level of 4 ng/mL is frequently used as the cut-off level. The test has a range of levels, and at high levels the risk \nof prostatic cancer being present is increased. At lower levels more patients will be identified who have a condition \nother than prostate cancer (prostatitis, benign prostatomegaly etc.). Reducing the cut-off level of the test to 2 ng/mL \nwould increase the test sensitivity but reduce the specificity. This will increase the number of false positives and create \nanxiety for a greater number of patients who would subsequently be worked up to decide whether the test was truly \npositive for prostate cancer. \nImplications: \nA highly sensitive test is an appropriate one for screening a population for an \nabnormality. A negative result in a highly sensitive test will effectively rule out the diagnosis. The fact that the test is not \nabsolutely specific for the abnormality but also identifies a number of individuals, who are normal or have some other \ncondition, can subsequently be taken care of by applying to the identified group a further test which is highly specific \n(but not so sensitive). In the highly specific test on individuals picked up by the sensitive screening test, a positive \nresult will effectively give a definite diagnosis. In the prostatic example above the subsequent test would be a tissue \nbiopsy confirming cancer. \nFaecal occult blood testing for bowel malignancies is another example of a test with a relatively high sensitivity but \npoor specificity, which will require further assessment (endoscopy) of those identified with a positive result. The \nsensitivity is determined also by the biology of the condition. In colorectal cancer, a faecal occult blood test will not \ndetect neoplasms which do not bleed. \nOther relevant aspects of testing are the frequency and importance of a disease and its duration and natural history. \nUnfortunately, measures of predictive value have limitations in clinical practice, as they depend on the \nprevalence of the disease in the population (Disease prevalence: \nthe number of people with the disease in the test population at the time of testing. This should not be confused with \ndisease incidence: the number of new cases of the disease occurring in the population over a set time interval). \n",

The likelihood ratio of a positive test is the \nfrequency of a positive test in disease compared with its frequency without disease, or [(a)/(a+c)]/[(b)/(b+d)]. \nThe value in example 1 is thus [(18/20)]/[(20/980)]. or approximately 50. \n301 \n",

If the test is \nnegative, the likelihood ratio (negative) is the frequency of a negative test without disease, compared with a \nnegative test in disease, or [d/(b+d)]/[c/(a+c)]. This is not the reciprocal of the likelihood ratio (positive); a \ntest will not be equally useful for confirming or excluding disease. \nIn example 1, the likelihood ratio (negative) is [(960/980)/(2/20)] or approximately 10. In that example, where \nthe prior odds of no disease were 50:1, the revised odds against disease, given a negative test, are now 500:1. \nIn example 2, the prior odds of no disease were approximately 500:1, the revised odds are now 5000:1. \nVarious scoring systems have been proposed, which follow a similar logic, using addition of mathematically \nderived scores, rather than the multiplication of odds and ratios. While some believe that addition of 'weights' in \nthis way may parallel the clinician's thought processes more closely, these systems have not been widely \nadopted. \nTest Error \nThe possibility of error in any test must thus always be considered. Most disturbing of all is the prospect of a \nmistake in the distinction between life and death. Now that the transplantation of cadaveric tissues has become \na clinical reality, and because procurement of such tissues within a short time of death is essential to success, \nthe unequivocal early diagnosis of brain death has demanded diagnostic tests of scrupulous and unparalleled \nstringency. As will be seen in the book example relating to brain death, note that virtually all the tests for brain \ndeath involve direct observation of the patient by at least two experienced clinicians rather than the application \nof potentially imperfect technologies. \nUSEFULNESS OF TESTS1 \nThe more tests that are performed on a patient the more likely it is that one or another will give a falsely \nabnormal result by pure chance. Another important factor is that multiple deviations from normality are common \nin any individual, especially in an ageing population. So, if multiple diagnostic tests are applied to a given patient \nin a mindless scattergun fashion, it is almost inevitable that one or more will be reported as positive. These \npositive results may be true or false, important or unimportant, relevant or irrelevant to the patients problem. \nRelatively simple clinical problems can all too easily become lost sight of in the maze created by multiple \ninvestigations. \n \n \n \n1 Glass, R.D., Diagnosis: a brief introduction, Oxford University Press, Australia, 1996 \n302 \n",

Initial screening urinary or serum analyses are most reliable \nfollowing an episode of symptoms but do not of course localise the site of origin. A battery of \nscreening tests was ordered, as well as standard preoperative screening tests. \n• Full blood examination     normal, Hb 151 g/L \n• Cardiovascular status      ECG sinus rhythm, no evidence cardiac ischaemia \n• Echocardiogram           no ventricular hypertrophy \n• Electrolytes                 normal \n• Coagulation studies        no abnormalities \n• Blood glucose             mild elevation \n• Specific urinary catecholamine excretion analysis can be for end products (VMA — \nvannylmandelic acid), or for adrenaline and noradrenaline themselves (normally 80% \nadrenaline and 20% noradrenaline). \nUrine 24 hour analyses for excretion of adrenaline and noradrenaline were done in this \ncase and were markedly elevated, with high levels of both noradrenaline and adrenaline \n— noradrenaline 1160 mmol/day (45-600), adrenaline 720 mmol/day (5-80). \nAs adrenal tumours may produce more than one hormone, a check for aldosterone effects was \nalso done measuring plasma aldosterone, renin activity levels, and aldosterone/renin ratio. All \nwere within normal range. Hydrocortisone (Cortisol) levels were also normal. \nThe diagnosis of right adrenal phaeochromocytoma was thus definitively established, and \nConn and Cushing syndrome excluded. But was the tumour only at one site? \nPhaeochromocytoma often causes attacks of episodic hypertension only and can be at multiple \nsites. It is designated the 10% tumour — 70% are bilateral, 10% are at extra-adrenal sites, 10% \nare malignant. Previously, extended open laparotomy was required to check fully for other \nabdominal sites — the opposite adrenal, the retroperitoneum down to the pelvis, the urinary \nbladder, and in the presacral area around the great vessels. Open surgery required large \nincisions, major surgical dissection of hazardous tissue planes, and inpatient stays of up to 2 \nweeks. \nThe advent of nuclear medicine has enabled accurate preoperative functional imaging to confirm \none or multiple sites precisely. Extra-adrenal tumours secrete noradrenaline only and are almost \nalways associated with hypertension, but the opposite adrenal always needs to be excluded as a \nsource. \n",

Temperature recording is easily performed and \ninexpensive, can be done accurately, is non-invasive and effectively free from risk. In terms of \ndetecting abnormality, it is extremely sensitive, but very low in specificity. It is a cost effective test \nthat can and should be applied to almost all clinical problems. A significantly elevated body \ntemperature indicates (in the absence of factitious malingering) an organic inflammatory or \ninfective ailment. The test is thus an excellent all round screening measure. \nUrinalysis \nThis shares many of the performance characteristics of temperature measurement and can be \napplied at minimum cost to virtually all clinical patients. Observer error has been reduced to a \nminimum by the development of user-friendly dipsticks. These can provide highly specific and \nhighly sensitive identification of glycosuria, proteinuria, biliuria, haematuria and other \nabnormalities. Medieval manuscripts used depictions of inspection of a urine flask (urinoscopy) \nas a convenient symbol of the medical practitioner — a convention based on clinical reality at the \ntime. Modern technology has enhanced rather than diminished the utility of urinoscopy/urinalysis \nin diagnosis. \nUrinary positivity for glucose will depend upon renal threshold. Blood glucose fingerprick analysis, \nnow also readily available by user-friendly office instruments (glucometer), allows rapid \nidentification of hyperglycaemia and can often establish the presence of diabetes. An elevated \nrandom blood glucose level over 11 mmol/L will effectively confirm the diagnosis of diabetes. \nGlycosuria and glycaemia here serve as complementary screening and diagnostic tests — high \nsensitivity screening augmented by specific diagnostic testing. \n307 \n",

Tests used \ndiscriminatively and with appropriate perception and perspective will enable the diagnostic process to move along \nappropriately focused lines to best advantage. \nData collection from focused history and physical examination leads to the discriminative clinician asking the \nquestions: \n• What is the patient's presenting condition? \n• What is the diagnosis? \n• What else could it be? \n• Have I enough certainty to stop testing and go on to treatment? \n• If more tests are required which are the best and in what sequence, and over what time interval? \nFor example, in diagnosing headache, acute headache is often part of an upper respiratory tract infection presentation \nassociated with other symptoms of general loss of well being. Chronic and recurring headaches are most usually due \neither to tension headache, migraine or cervical dysfunction/spondylosis. Of the many other causes, warning flags \nshould be looked for in the clinical assessment to exclude temporal arteritis, subarachnoid haemorrhage and cerebral \ntumour. A persisting headache is also an associated symptom secondary to a wide range of other conditions. CT head \nscan is only required in the minority of instances, when an intracranial lesion causing cerebral compression with \nincreased intracranial pressure is suspected. \nLow back pain and neck pain are most often due to temporary soft tissue musculo-ligamentous strains ('nonspecific \nmechanical back pain'). Precise anatomical or pathologic diagnosis is often not possible. The place of investigations is \nconfounded by the facts that degenerative change in discs and facet joints which could be associated with \nsymptomatic pain are found in a significant proportion of nonsymptomatic individuals, especially those aged over 40 \nyears, where the prevalence is likely to be at least 30%. Contrariwise in patients with chronic low back pain, no \nsignificant organic pathology is demonstrable in around 30% of patients. \nPlain X-rays will exclude serious bony lesions and may give evidence of soft tissue pathology, but CT (or nowadays \nand increasingly, MRI scanning) gives the most accurate assessment of soft tissues; and despite its expense the latter \ninvestigation of MRI is usually the preferred investigation in chronic spinal pain. Ultrasound is of limited use in spinal \npain, but ultrasound is usually the investigation of first choice in acute or chronic shoulder pain following injury. \nHowever, ultrasound is very observer-dependent, and again MRI is likely to be more sensitive and specific. \nWith acute abdominal pain, a small group of patients with a catastrophic syndrome of 'acute abdominal surgical \nemergency' requires urgent surgery with minimal preoperative investigations. In this case surgery is the major and \nmost urgent investigation, and leads directly to diagnosis and management of such causes as acute abdominal aortic \naneurysm rupture, and acute ischaemic strangulation of bowel.

Ultrasound and helical CT or MRCP comprise \ninvestigative mainstays. Important investigations prior to surgical management include blood \ncoagulation tests and tests of renal function. Patients with suspected bowel pathology can be \ninvestigated either by radiology or endoscopy. Colonoscopy is preferred to diagnose mucosal \nlesions. \nFor focal subcutaneous lumps and focal skin lesions, in many instances no investigations are \nrequired and an accurate diagnosis can be obtained from the clinical history and examination. If \nthe lump or skin lesion is clinically suspicious then the definitive investigation is often histological \nexamination of an operative specimen. Preliminary diagnostic investigations are often done to \ndetermine more accurately the physical nature of deep lumps. Ultrasound can differentiate \nbetween cystic and solid lesions, while CT or MRI will give more precise diagnosis. Once the \ndecision is made that microscopic examination is necessary, fine needle aspiration cytology \n(FNAC) is often a highly specific test, particularly for patients presenting with breast lumps \n(palpable or picked up by imaging), or subcutaneous lymph node swellings. Aspiration cytology \ngives cytological rather than histological diagnosis; but using flow cytometry and assessing \nsurface receptors to differentiate subsets of T and B lymphocytes can diagnose and differentiate \npolyclonal and monoclonal lymphomas, as discussed in Section 4-A. \nCytological studies may also demonstrate the likely origin of metastatic lesions by finding \nsquamous neoplastic cells in a lymph node neck swelling, or by finding a papillary thyroid lesion \nin neck lymph nodes. Primary growths of pharyngolarynx and thyroid can be small and occult in \nassociation with larger nodal metastases. Accurate cytology can point the way to a further \nappropriate sequence of diagnostic investigations. Finally core biopsy by percutaneous needling \nis widely used and is the preferred diagnostic method for solid breast lumps and other deeper \nlumps where tissue diagnosis is required. \nIn the examples which follow, candidates should exercise care in the choice and interpretation of \ninvestigation in order to direct and focus diagnostic and management pathways. \n \nReuben D Glass and Vernon C Marshall \n",

If positive this will influence \nthe care required in a pregnancy. \nCounselling \nIn counselling about hepatitis C and risk to the patient, the candidate is expected to know that \nhepatitis C is a viral infection transmitted mainly via infected human blood. In most patients the \ndiagnosis is made only when the disease is established and chronic. In this patient, the exposure \nwas almost certainly at the time of intravenous drug use 6-8 years ago. In order to best identify \nthe risk of liver disease, LFTs and HCV PCR should be performed \n• An HCV PCR should be performed to help determine if the patient has spontaneously cleared \nthe infection. \n• In any patient, if serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is persistently normal (three \nestimations over a six month period) the prognosis is good and it is likely no long-term \nadverse liver effects will ever be found.

Ultimately liver failure and liver transplantation \nmay be required in a small percentage of cases, and the patient is also at increased risk of \nhepatocellular carcinoma. \nWhen the above aspects have been sorted out, a decision can be made regarding the \nadvisability of a pregnancy. Pregnancy should not be allowed until at least 6 months has elapsed \nafter cessation of antiviral therapy, if this has been given, due to the teratogenicity of the ribavirin. \nIf pregnancy is to be allowed, the oral contraceptive pill should be ceased and the pregnancy \nawaited. The chance of the baby being infected by vertical transmission during the pregnancy is \nabout 5% in patients who have a positive PCR for HCV. \nCounselling about hepatitis C and risk to others \nPrevention of infection of others can only be achieved by ensuring all people who come in \ncontact with her blood take appropriate precautions, and that the sharing of needles is never \ndone. There is no risk of hepatitis C transmission by hugging, kissing, casual contact, sharing \nfood or eating utensils. However it is important to avoid sharing objects with potential for blood \ncontamination, such as razors and toothbrushes. The risk of vertical transmission is very low. \nThere are no recommendations against breastfeeding. The risk of spreading this infection during \nsexual activity is extremely low, and there is little or no evidence that condom usage will be of \nvalue in protecting her husband from his very low risk of getting infected in this way. Hepatitis C is \na notifiable disease — notification is confidential. \nPatient education \nThe good candidate will seek to provide the patient with appropriate supplementary patient \neducation material. \n \nKEY ISSUES \n• Taking a focused history in regard to determining the source of the infection. \n• Advising the patient appropriately regarding subsequent care, the risk of liver pathology, and \nthe need to ensure blood transmission does not occur, as this would be likely to result in \nhepatitis C infection in the recipient. \n \nCRITICAL ERRORS \n• Failure to recognise the need for LFT (ALT) assessments. \n• Advising the patient of a benign course of disease in all instances. \n \nCOMMENTARY \nHepatitis C is a single stranded RNA virus. Risk factors for hepatitis C infection include intra-\nvenous drug use (70%), sexual exposure (-10%), blood transfusion (6%), occupational exposure \n(3%), unknown (-10%). The risks of tattoos, body piercing and intranasal cocaine are not well \ndefined. The viral infection is established and chronic at the time of diagnosis in most patients.

Thus, immediate function of the graft in \nits new host can be anticipated provided total ischaemic times after organ removal do not exceed \nthe tolerated time periods for the individual organs — around 6 hours for hearts and up to 24-48 \nhours for liver, kidneys and other organs. \nClearly the diagnosis of irreversible and permanent loss of brain and brain stem function must be \nan unequivocal and certain one, with absolutely no prospect of error. We need tests of absolute \nspecificity and sensitivity. \nThe several criteria and tests listed outline the ways of ensuring that irreversible loss of function \nhas occurred both in the higher cortical brain functions, and also in the functions of the brain \nstem, where the respiratory centre and cranial nerve origins are clustered. \nThe criteria listed for diagnosis of brain death first require the appropriate clinical setting (usually \nmassive head injury or a catastrophic stroke), and the presence of deep and totally unresponsive \ncoma with permanent loss of function of the respiratory centre, so no spontaneous breathing can \noccur because the brain stem centre for breathing has been irreversibly destroyed (and in the \nabsence of respiratory activity, cardiac arrest inevitably follows within 30 minutes or less unless \nventilation is restored by artificial ventilation). \nThe other criteria are the exclusion of other possible contributors to prolonged coma \n(hypothermia, continuing central nervous system paralysis from drugs or curare-like respiratory \ndepressants, or gross metabolic and endocrine disturbances). \nThe tests then employed as listed in the criteria of brain death are diagnostic of destroyed and \nabsent brain stem reflexes, involving successively the midbrain, pons and medulla, so that loss of \nbrain stem function is progressively confirmed from above downwards, testing reflexes \nsubserved by cranial nerves 2 through 12 via their sensory and motor pathways, and the brain \nstem reflex arcs from highest to lowest level. \nPermanent irreversible apnoea (failure of spontaneous breathing) due to death of the respiratory \ncentre is confirmed over a 10-minute interval in the presence of a high level of build up of carbon \ndioxide in the blood, which in the presence of a responsive respiratory centre will stimulate \nspontaneous breathing. \nCriteria for confirmation of findings is by two groups of tests separated by an appropriate period of \nobservation, and confirmed by two independent doctors, including a senior and experienced \nclinician. \n \nMeticulous application of these defined and universally accepted worldwide criteria has \nensured that brain death can be diagnosed clinically with absolute confidence and without \nany risk of misdiagnosis. \nDiagnosis of brain death is made by meticulous clinical observations and tests and does not \nrequire elaborate technology for certainty of diagnosis. \n \nThe doctor here has been put on the spot by the bluntness and directness of the science \nteacher's request.

Certainly all doctors should be conversant with the laws \ngoverning consent for donation given by the next of kin, but the request would come normally \nfrom an experienced senior member of the intensive care team, and not from a junior Hospital \nMedical Officer (HMO). Initial discussion with the candidate could then be followed by a \nsubsequent briefing in which the doctor could read up about the more specific details of diagnosis \nof brain death and the science and ethics of cadaver organ transplantation before meeting the \nteacher again. \nThis station is a rather extreme example of the increasingly common practice of patients \npresenting to doctors with printed internet reports related to their presenting problem, often quite \ndetailed but not always appropriate in their perspective or application to the particular problem \nposed by the patient. \nIn this instance, the isolated table the teacher brought was presumably taken from a larger \ngeneral account, which would be more relevant than the specifics of agonochemical events and \nthe specifics of tests used to diagnose permanent and irreversible death of the brain and brain \nstem. The essential principle is that the criteria and tests provide the legal basis for medical \ncertification of the death of a person (because the brain is dead) even though other functions of \nthe body (heartbeat and machine-driven ventilation) are still going on with the support of \nmachines and transfusions so the person (who is now actually a cadaver) 'looks alive'. \nKnowledgeable candidates should be able to give a general description, similar to the above, of \nbrain death. In particular, that: \n• all the vital brain stem centres have been destroyed, including the respiratory centre and \nconsciousness centre, so the condition presents as a totally unresponsive individual with \npermanent loss of consciousness, with permanent loss of the capacity to breathe: \n• the various tests described are tests of these brain stem and higher functions to be certain that \nall are permanently and irreversibly destroyed over a repeated period of observation: and \n• all other potential influences on consciousness (like effects of drugs) have been eliminated \nwith certainty. \nDoctors should also know that the condition of brain death, its certification and its legal and \nethical implications have been ratified by all major religions, and that the time of brain death is \nseen by theologians to equate with the time at which the soul leaves the body. It is also important \nto understand that brain death means death of the individual as surely as does recognition of \ndeath by cessation of heartbeat. \nObjections from next of kin to obtaining consent for organ donation after certification of brain \ndeath are usually cultural and emotional and associated with fear of mutilation of the body. \n \nThe vegetative state comprises the condition of deep coma with present but ineffective \nspontaneous breathing and with retention of other brain stem activities and reflexes, requiring \nartificial feeding (and often respiratory assistance), and responding to a variety of stimuli. It is \nNOT brain death. Knowledgeable candidates will stress this fact. \n",

      "text": "330 \n060 \nPerformance Guidelines \nCRITICAL ERROR - none d e f i n e d  \nCOMMENTARY  \nThe scenario illustrates a common problem. Breast cancer is very common in Australian women \nand around 1 in 14 women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime. The risk is increased in the \npresence of family history of breast cancer in first degree relatives, as is the case here. \nThis young patient requires regular clinical screening and appropriate imaging. The ultrasound \nordered by the family doctor was appropriate as initial investigation. Note that her original \nproblem (cyclical mastalgia) has now been replaced by the more serious problem of 'I have a \nbreast lump which could be cancerous' Her natural reaction (which might be the correct solution \nto the problem) is 'I want it out.' \nBenign impalpable (or palpable) fibroadenomas and other benign parenchymal lesions are very \ncommon in this age group. We know from mass screening that benign lesions occur throughout \nall stages of life, and that the natural history of fibroadenomas may be to remain unchanged, to \nincrease in size or to regress. No convincing evidence exists that benign fibroadenomas are \npremalignant, and much collateral evidence on screening programme followup suggests that \nthey are not. Whether total excisional biopsy or partial core biopsy should be performed will \ndepend on circumstances, but an appropriate core biopsy would take five or more representative \nsamples and would be expected to give a definitively accurate diagnosis with minimal likelihood \nof either a falsely negative or falsely positive result, and with minimal morbidity in experienced \nhands. This lesion is impalpable and both clinical findings (normal breasts) and imaging findings \n(typical ultrasound appearance of a benign lesion) already favour a benign fibroadenoma. But \nthese findings alone are no! enough, and pathological confirmation by biopsy is required \nadditionally to make our reassurance quite positive ('triple test check' — clinical, imaging, and \npathology all confirmed and negative for cancer). Pathology can be determined by fine needle \naspiration cytology (FNAC) or by percutaneous image-guided needle core biopsy. Choice will \ndepend on circumstances and availability of expert cytology and pathology services; but core \nbiopsy will give a tissue diagnosis and has higher sensitivity and specificity, so is generally \npreferred. \nIf the 'triple test' is negative, the lesion is virtually certain to be benign. The patient will require \ncontinuing periodic clinical and imaging review from her family doctor and surgeon. The \nsurgeon's advice was therefore appropriate and concise, but she has not convinced the patient \nthat it is the right plan. The utility of any advice regarding management is only relevant and \nhelpful if patient acceptance is present. If this patient remains unconvinced and unhappy, despite \nrepeated reinforcement by the family doctor, clearly the best decision may be to agree to her own \nwishes that the lesion is removed. This will require an image-guided needle localisation \noperation. It is unlikely that the surgeon would not agree to this, even though she (the surgeon) \ncorrectly regards core biopsy and observation as the best option. \n",

(Yes. Emily has fractured the arm bone [humerus] just above the elbow. \nThere is minimal displacement and no complications. She should get excellent results with full \nfunctional recovery). \n• 'What treatment will she need?'(\\Ne will apply a back slab/plaster/splint to the elbow with a \nbandage and sling. No anaesthetic will be needed. Pain relief will be ensured by paracetamol \nas required, dose for age. She will need to keep the elbow in plaster for several weeks [4-6 \nweeks] as illustrated. She will need a first followup tomorrow to check plaster and fingers, and \nthat she is comfortable with the plaster and sling. The parent should report earlier if hand or \nfingers swell further. She should sleep \nwith arm supported on a pillow. \nSubsequent unrestricted use of hand \nand fingers should be encouraged with \nself-maintenance finger stretches). \n• 'What about school and writing?'

(Vascular njury to the brachial artery). \nKEY ISSUES \n• \nRecognition of fracture on X-ray. \n• \nUnderstanding  principles and  practice of management of an  undisplaced uncomplicated closed supracondylar \nfracture. \n• \nUnderstanding of potential complications in this type of fracture. \nCRITICAL ERRORS  \n• \nMissing the diagnosis of fracture \n• \nFailing to arrange appropriate review and followup. \n• \nFailure to know of risk of vascular complications in displaced supracondylar fractures.  \nCOMMENTARY \nSupracondylar humeral fractures are common in children following falls on the arm or hand. Undisplaced fractures or \nthose with minor displacements can be treated without need for reduction by immobilising the elbow using a padded \nbackslab or plaster (leaving shoulder and wrist and hand free to move) in the position of function of partial \nelbow-flexion of around 100° flexion. \nSeverely displaced fractures will require reduction under anaesthesia and similar splintage after alignment is checked. \nA serious complication to be watched for is injury to the brachial artery from the anteriorly displaced upper fragment, \ngiving ischaemia of the hand and fingers shown by pallor, insensitivity and absent radial pulse. \nUnless circulation is clearly restored after reduction, such ischaemia must be treated by open exploration of the \nfracture site and the injured artery with restoration of adequate blood flow by vascular surgery, otherwise Volkmann \nischaemic contracture of forearm muscles can occur. \nFortunately in the majority of cases, displacement is minor or alignment is readily corrected and no vascular \ncomplications are present; but circulation must always be checked by review after 24 hours, and parents and patients \nadvised to report earlier if symptoms of numbness, finger swelling or severe hand pain occur. \nImmobilisation is usually only needed in children for 4-6 weeks and active mobilising exercises then begin. \nEmily would be expected to make a full functional recovery after this injury and did so as llustrated (Figure 4). \n",

A pneumothorax of this size may \nnot need active treatment. It would be prudent and reasonable to admit the patient overnight \nfor observation and serial X-ray. Sending the patient home if she lives nearby is a less \nacceptable option with a pneumothorax of this size. Recurrence is possible after spontaneous \npneumothorax, and the recurrence rate is approximately 35% on the same side and 10-15% \non opposite side. Most recurrences occur within 12 months. \n• The general consensus regarding the need for intercostal drainage is as follows: \n~ If 25-30% or less lung collapse and no symptoms — observe. This is a reasonable option in \nthis patient. \n~ If 25-30% or less lung collapse and persisting symptoms — drain. The patient may fall into \nthis category with observation. The pneumothorax is around 30% and her symptoms are \ncurrently mild. \n~ If greater than 30% collapse, whether symptomatic or not — drain. \nDisplaying clinical knowledge and skills \n• Aetiology of pneumothorax — rupture of bleb on surface of lung. \n• Nature of pain associated with pneumothorax — possibly due to tear of adhesion as lung \ncollapses. \n• Associated breathlessness — depends on size of pneumothorax. \n• Confirmatory investigation — chest X-ray diagnostic. This is a moderate (25-30%) \npneumothorax. It may need a formal chest drain. Inserting a catheter with a Heimlich valve is \nan option to be discussed should the pneumothorax increase in size. \nDemonstrating Communication skills \n• Reassuring approach to patient anxious about the cause of the pain. \n• The pain should be recognised as being of respiratory origin, rather than cardiac. \n \nKEY ISSUES \n• Correct interpretation of chest X-ray. \n• Explaining the diagnosis and appropriate management to the patient. \n \nCRITICAL ERROR \n• Failure to identify the pneumothorax on the chest X-ray. \n",

A few days ago you \nsuddenly developed very severe lower abdominal pain for which you attended the \nEmergency Department at this hospital. You were diagnosed as most probably having \na stone in one ureter (the tubes which connect the kidneys to the bladder). The pain \nwas relieved by an injection and has not returned. An X-ray of your kidneys was \narranged (IVP). You were told to strain your urine but so far nothing has been found. \nToday you are attending the follow up clinic for the result of the X-ray. \nBe yourself. Be more concerned about the kidney abnormality (which the candidate \nshould explain to you) than about the possibility of a stone in the ureter. \nQuestions to ask if not already covered: \n• 'What does this mean for the future?' \n• 'Why is my kidney in the wrong place?'— ask this if the candidate advises you that \nyour right kidney is not in its normal position. \n• 'Is the stone still in there somewhere?' \n• 'Will I get another stone?' \n• 'Is this kidney likely to develop a cancer?' \nEXPECTATIONS OF CANDIDATE PERFORMANCE  \nThe candidate should in commentary to the examiner interpret the IVP appropriately \nand indicate that the abnormality shown is a left-sided crossed fused ectopic kidney \nwith separate calyceal systems and ureters. This anomaly is obvious on the film. The \nabnormal position of the right kidney must be described. There is no evidence of a \ncalculus in either ureter on the single film available \nThe candidate, in discussion with the patient, should: \n• check and confirm that no stone has been found on straining the urine. Reassure \npatient that on the X-ray there is no sign of any urinary calculus. Avoid alarming the \npatient about the congenital renal abnormality. \n• explain that the stone is likely to have been passed spontaneously. No need to strain \nurine anymore. Ensure adequate fluid intake in future especially in hot weather. \nReport further symptoms. Inform future medical attendants of the renal abnormality, \nespecially if suffering from an abdominal complaint.

Otherwise the renal abnormality is of no significance and needs no treatment except awareness of its \npresence in the case of trauma to the left side of the abdomen or left sided abdominal pain. \nThe condition is congenital (present from birth) and variations in kidney position are quite common. The patient should \nbe reassured concerning the future, although warned that recurrence of renal/ureteric colic may occur if further stone \nformation occurs. \nKEY ISSUES \n• \nInterpretation of investigations — must identify abnormal position of right kidney on the X-ray. \n• \nInitial management plan — no further action required as stone has most likely passed, \n• \nPatient counselling/education — reassurance, explanation of renal abnormalities. Ensure patient awareness if \nany future abdominal pain occurs. \nCRITICAL ERROR  \n• \nFailure to describe abnormal position of right kidney.  \nCOMMENTARY  \nAlthough intravenous urography/pyelography (IVP) is now largely replaced by computed tomography (CT) when \nscanning for suspected urinary calculi, in this case a urogram is used to assess the candidate's ability to interpret an \nX-ray finding which is quite obvious if anatomical knowledge is sound. \nCongenital anomalies of the kidney and its vascular and urinary drainage systems are relatively common: up to 10% \nof infants may be born with some anomaly of the genitourinary system. \nUnilateral renal agenesis (congenital absence of one kidney) occurs in about 1 in every 1000 births, and may be \naccompanied in a male by the absence of the vas deferens on the affected side. In the female, uterine and vaginal \nabnormalities commonly co-exist. \nThe kidney begins intrauterine development in the pelvis, ascending to its adult position on the posterior abdominal \nwall by birth, and acquiring fresh blood supply from progressively higher blood vessels with exclusion of others as \ndifferential growth of body segmental somites occurs. \nEctopic kidneys \nOne or both kidneys may be in an abnormal position. Most ectopic kidneys are pelvic in position, and may present as \na pelvic mass, or be felt on rectal or vaginal examination. An ectopic kidney may be on its own side, or on the side of \nthe normal kidney (crossed ectopia), and may be fused with the normal kidney or pelvic in site — as is this instance of \ncrossed fused renal ectopia. In 'pancake' kidney a single pelvic renal mass is served by two collecting systems and \nureters. Ectopic pelvic kidneys usually receive their blood supply from local vessels; the ureter of the displaced kidney \noften crosses to its own side and opens into the bladder in the normal position. \n",

Only ask this question if the candidate has already \ndiscussed the use of IVF. \nEXPECTATIONS OF CANDIDATE PERFORMANCE  \nThe history should cover the likely causes of the abnormal semen specimen, as detailed in the patient answers. \nThe candidate should advise along the following lines. \n• One semen specimen is insufficient to make a meaningful prediction of fertility potential. Preferably three \nspecimens obtained about three months apart are required. If these show the same findings as the first \none, then clearly there is a problem which is almost certainly a major factor in the infertility. \n• It is unlikely a cause of the abnormal semen specimen will be found. \n• A number of blood tests should be performed to provide information as to the likely reversibility of the problem. This \nwould include at least the measurement of serum FSH and testosterone levels. If the FSH is high, spontaneous \nimprovement in the analysis is less likely. \n• If the semen analysis improves spontaneously with time, the possibility of achieving a pregnancy is increased. \n• There is no documented evidence for the use of hormone or other treatment, in improving the semen specimen, \n• There is a definite place for the use of IVF, with intracytoplasmic sperm injection in the oocyte (ICSI). This has a \npregnancy rate of about 20-40%/cycle. IVF without the use of ICSI has poor results (about 2-5% pregnancy rate \nper cycle of transfer). \n• There is a place for the use of donor sperm and performing artificial insemination, if this had been acceptable. \nPregnancy rate is about 20% per cycle of insemination. Use of donor semen is cheaper and more straightforward \nthan other methods of treatment such as IVF, but the baby would not contain any of the husband's genetic material. \n• Intrauterine insemination using his poor semen sample has a very poor success rate (about 1-2% \npregnancies/cycle of insemination). \n \nKEY ISSUES \n• Need for appropriate history from husband. \n• Knowledge of appropriate tests to assess him, and of the possibility of improvement with time. \n• Need for empathie counselling. \n• Ability to understand that a definitive cause is unlikely to be found. \n",

A properly conducted \nconsultation establishes an effective doctor-patient relationship. The consultation is the basis of \nthe diagnostic and treatment formulations, the vehicle for a patient's education about health \npromotion, clinical problems, disease processes and test interpretations. It can also motivate a \npatient to follow treatment recommendations. It is usually not a 'one-off encounter; the first \nconsultation is generally followed by further consultation visits at variable intervals which can \nextend over many years. The following are the broad objectives of a medical consultation: \n \n• Establish or build on an effective, professional doctor-patient relationship. \n• Determine and evaluate the patient's physical and psychological symptoms. \n• Identify abnormal physical and mental state signs. \n• Define the clinical problem(s) — the patient's principal condition(s). \n• Choose and interpret appropriate investigations. \n• Reach the correct diagnosis (the doctor is progressively developing and testing hypotheses). \n• Explain to the patient the nature of the condition, its physical, psychological and social \nconsequences. \n• Reach agreement with the patient on a plan of management. \n• Institute treatment. \n• Arrange referral to other clinicians or \nhealth workers appropriately. \n• Devise methods of relieving pain and \nsuffering. \nSome commonly encountered problems \nduring a clinical consultation are: \n• \nfailure to observe common courtesies; \n• \nfailure to establish levels of comprehension \nand communication capabilities; \n• \nignoring emotional réponses and concerns; \n• \noveruse of directed, closed questions; \n• \nexcessive use of leading or loaded \nquestions; \n• \nvague or complex questions; \n• \nusing jargon; \n• \ndisjointed questioning; \n• \nabrupt topic changes; \n• \nlack of expressiveness in interviewer's \nbody language or voice; \n• \nnot discerning patient's ideas and beliefs \nabout the problem; \n• \nnarrowing the focus of enquiry too soon. \n• Provide advice on health promotion. \n• Reassure the worried well. \n343 \n",

The goals of the \nconsultation will vary with the setting and the urgency of the clinical problem(s). Whatever the \nsetting, the doctor must respect the patient's safety, privacy, dignity, modesty, physical and \npsychological well-being. Attention should be paid to the interview setting (for example, the \nseating arrangement). Medical interviewers must be appropriately dressed, with a professional, \nfriendly demeanour and introduce themselves in a way that identifies their roles. The interviewer, \nif a medical student or if not the patient's usual medical practitioner (for example, a trainee), will \nneed to seek the patient's permission to conduct the consultation. \nCommunication skills \nFirst impressions, as in most human encounters, are very important. An expert medical \ninterviewer may adopt a variety of techniques, with an underlying self-questioning approach: \n'How can I connect with this patient?'

Establishing whether or not the patient wishes, or indeed, if it is appropriate, to \nproceed to interview in the presence of 'a significant other' needs to be established early. \nDepending on the circumstances, the interviewer may seek to conduct the medical consultation \nwith the patient alone initially and then subsequently involve the 'significant other' or family \nmembers, but again only with the patient's permission. \nPatient-related factors and  doctor-related  factors can  influence  doctor-patient communication. \nIt is critically important to establish, as soon as possible, if there are any impediments to \ncommunication such as dementia, physical disability (such as deafness, blindness, stroke), \nlanguage or cultural attitude.  \nA skilled medical interviewer will exhibit: \n• an encouraging, warm and empathie manner; \n• nonjudgmental attitude; \n• good eye contact; \n• respect for patient's dignity, awareness of any discomfort; \n• alertness and responsiveness to nonverbal as well as verbal cues; \n• good listening skills; \n• use of mainly open questions; and \n• note-taking that does not interfere with patient rapport. Some \ncommonly encountered problems include: \n• failure to observe common courtesies: \n• failure to establish levels of comprehension and communication capabilities: \n• ignoring emotional responses and concerns; \n• overuse of directed, closed questions, excessive use of leading or loaded questions; \n• vague or complex questions; \n• using jargon; \n• disjointed questioning; \n• abrupt topic changes; \n• lack of expressiveness in interviewer's body language or voice; \n• not discerning patient's ideas and beliefs about the problem; and \n• narrowing the focus of enquiry too soon. \n",

The diagnosis is \noften made early in the medical consultation. Usually a list of alternative hypotheses, or \ndifferential diagnoses, are considered, ranked and further addressed Additional information is \nobtained from the physical examination and specific investigations which serve to confirm the \ndiagnoses, determine their severity and effects and to exclude alternative (differential) \ndiagnoses. The following points are germane to the process of clinical reasoning: \n• Iterative nature of process: the diagnostic hypothesis is continually being strengthened \nrefined, modified or totally reformulated on the basis of responses to questions. \n• 80% of clinical diagnoses are reached on the basis of history alone. \n• Clinical examination often provides confirmatory information; in some cases a new diagnosis \nis defined. \n• Investigations provide the diagnosis in only about 10% of instances. \nThe process of problem identification is summarised in the accompanying figure \nSECTION 2-D.

The candidate needs to show an appreciation of \ncardiovascular risk factors, and an efficient ability to characterise associated symptoms and to \ndefine the context in which the symptom of chest pain has arisen. \n• Commentary to examiner — a succinct summary which brings together the key features of the \npresenting complaint, the context in which it has arisen, the associated symptoms and the \ncardiovascular risk factors.

      "text": "065 \nPerformance Guidelines \n \n \n \nAcute coronary ischaemia syndromes \nAll the acute coronary syndromes share the underlying pathology of an atherosclerotic plaque \nwhich becomes active acutely with rupture of the plaque with resultant platelet adhesion, \nthrombosis, vasoconstriction and inflammation. The exact syndrome depends on the extent of \nthrombosis, the degree of distal embolisation of platelet thrombi and the resultant myocardial \nnecrosis. When the thrombus that occurs on a ruptured plaque completely occludes the \ncoronary artery, the result is severe transmural myocardial ischaemia with ST elevation on the \nECG. This may cause sudden death from ventricular fibrillation. If the coronary occlusion is not \nrelieved, myocardial infarction develops progressively over the next 6-12 hours. This is often \nassociated with evolution of evidence of transmural myocardial infarction on the ECG as shown \nby the development of Q waves. \nThe acute coronary syndromes are differentiated on the basis of extent and duration of chest \npain, ECG changes and biochemical markers. They are divided into two syndromes: (1) \nassociated with ST elevation on the ECG (ST elevation myocardial infarction, STEMI) and (2) \nthose without ST elevation (non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, NSTEMI) associated with \neither ST depression, T-wave inversion or no changes on the ECG. NSTEMI is differentiated \nfrom unstable angina on the basis of biochemical evidence of myocardial necrosis (elevated \ntroponin level). \nThe following figures give examples of different patterns of myocardial infarction: \n \nCONDITION 065.

Careful history-taking is \nessential in assessing such patients. The candidate needs to define the attacks, the nature of the \narrhythmia (rate, rhythm, onset, offset, context) and the close association between the two \nsymptoms. Also critical to the assessment is an understanding of potential risk factors and \nprécipitants of cardiac arrhythmias. Underpinning the history-taking, the candidate needs to \nhave knowledge of the causes of cardiac arrhythmias and the manifestations of different types of \narrhythmias. \nObtaining an ECG during an attack and its correct interpretation is a key step in the assessment \nof this patient. \n \nEXAMINER INSTRUCTIONS \nThe examiner will have instructed the patient as follows: \nYou are lying on a trolley in the Emergency Department. You were brought to hospital by \nambulance. \nOpening statement \n'I've been getting attacks of palpitations and dizziness over the past three days. ' \n In response to specific questioning, provide the following information: \n• History of presenting complaints — The palpitations and dizziness seem to come on together. \nYou have them now. \n• Palpitations - These are described as a fast beating of the heart going into the neck. If asked to \ntap out the rhythm on the desk, give a rapid regular beat of about 150/min. There have been \nfour attacks over the past three days, each lasting for about two hours. The attacks come on \nsuddenly and stop suddenly. Three of the episodes occurred after the evening meal and the \nfourth whilst driving. Nothing you have tried seems to stop the attack. There is no associated \nchest pain but you are mildly short of breath and sweat during and for a short time after each \nattack. There is no flushing, headache or nausea. \n• Dizziness — This is a light-headed, near fainting experience which comes on within a minute of \nthe palpitations and lasts for the duration of the attack. You feel you have to lie down. \n• Systems review There is no history of heat intolerance, nervousness or tremor. You are \noverweight with no recent change in weight. Bowel function is normal. \n• Habits — You smoke 20 cigarettes per day; drink 4 or 5 glasses of wine with the evening meal \nand 5 cups of coffee per day. You are on no medications. \n• Social history — You have a sedentary solitary lifestyle. Your job is stressful as a company \nsecretary and the company you work for is restructuring. \n• Family history — No significant family history of heart disease or cardiac arrhythmias. \n",

In addition the candidate is expected to explore possible underlying cardiac diseases, in this \ncase particularly the possibilities of hypertensive heart disease or alcoholic cardiomyopathy. \n• \nAbility to provide a concise clinical summary \nThis should be along the following lines and reflect the manner in which a junior doctor would describe the key \nfeatures of the history to a registrar or consultant. \n'The patient is a 50-year-old company secretary who presents with his fourth attack of palpitations and dizziness over \nthe past 3 days. Three of the attacks have occurred in the evenings after his meal and one whilst driving. Each attack \nlasts approximately 2 hours, they come on suddenly and stop suddenly and the dizziness, which he describes as a \nnear-fainting experience, always accompanies the palpitations. The nature of the palpitations is that they appear to \nbe rapid, approximately 150/min and regular. He is currently experiencing an attack. The attacks are also associated \nwith shortness of breath and sweating, but no chest pain. \nConsidering possible underlying causes for his attacks, he has a history of high blood pressure but no known cardiac \ndisease. He has a high alcohol intake and has recently been under stress at work. He is also at risk of ischaemic heart \ndisease because of his smoking, obesity and sedentary lifestyle. There is no evidence on history to suggest \nthyrotoxicosis.

Pulse is 150/min and regular, \nblood pressure is 150/96 mmHg. Heart sounds show dual rhythm with no bruits and are synchronous with the \npulse. There are no signs of cardiac failure. Examination otherwise is noncontnbutory \n \n• \nDiagnosis \nThe most likely diagnosis is paroxysmal atrial arrhythmia, probably atrial flutter. The key features that suggest this \ndiagnosis are the sudden onset and offset, the rapid, regular palpitations and the rate.

      "text": "066 \nPerformance Guidelines \n \n \n \nCOMMENTARY1 2 3   \nPalpitations are the symptom of an abnormal awareness of heart rate. They may be due to a \nchange in the rate, rhythm or force of the heartbeats or some combination of these. It is important \nto ask the patient to tap out with a finger what is noticed when the palpitations arise. Anxious \npatients may be aware of their normal heartbeat. Isolated forceful beats ('thump in the chest') are \nusually caused by ectopic beats. Patients may also report their heart 'misses a beat', usually due \neither to a compensatory pause after a ventricular ectopic beat or a nonforceful ectopic beat. \nAwareness of a fast heart rate usually occurs when this is of recent origin. It is important to \ndetermine whether this is regular or irregular and whether there are any associated symptoms. \nThe development of symptoms in a patient with an atrial arrhythmia will depend on the rate, the \nrhythm, underlying cardiac disease and patient characteristics. A common problem encountered \nin older patients with hypertensive heart disease who develop atrial fibrillation is that the \npresence of a poorly compliant (stiff) left ventricle renders them quite intolerant to this arrhythmia, \nwhere there is loss of the contribution of atrial contraction to ventricular filling, leading to left heart \nfailure. \nAtrial flutter usually presents with 2:1 atrioventricular block and a regular ventricular rate of \n150/min. It is often misdiagnosed as supraventricular tachycardia. Rarely conduction occurs 1:1, \ngiving a ventricular rate of 300/min and severe symptoms. Much more frequently greater degrees \nof AV block are present giving ventricular rates of 100 (3:1 block) or 75 (4:1 block). Patients may \nbe asymptomatic except when the rate changes (e.g. from 4:1 to 2:1 block). An example of atrial \nflutter with 4:1 block is seen in the figure below (Figure 3). Note the characteristic saw-tooth \nappearance of the P waves. \n \nCONDITION 066. FIGURE \n3.  \nAtrial flutter with 4:1 block \nIn untreated patients with a normal AV node, atrial fibrillation (AF) usually presents with an \nirregular ventricular rate of 160-180/min. Older patients with impaired AV conduction can often \npresent with lower rates. Apart from the first episode, where the natural history is not clear, atrial \nfibrillation tends to fall into one of three clinical patterns (the so-called 'three Ps'). Patients may \nprogress from one to another. These patterns are: \n \n• Paroxysmal AF (episodes which come on suddenly and usually revert spontaneously within 48 \nhours); \n• Persistent AF (episodes persist for days or weeks unless active measures are taken to revert \nto sinus rhythm); and \n1 \nTherapeutic Guidelines Cardiovascular Version 4 2003. \n2 \nWyse DG.

      "text": " \n372\nManagement \nThe candidate is expected to indicate to the patient that if the blood tests confirm the suspected diagnosis of \npolymyalgia rheumatica, then the patient is likely to have a good response to a limited course of prednisolone which \nmay need to be given for up to two years, but that any such treatment, how it is given and monitored, must await the \nresults of the tests. The patient should be advised to report any severe headaches, visual disturbance or pain in the \njaw when eating, since giant cell arteritis can occur together with polymyalgia rheumatica. \nKEY ISSUES  \n• \nFocused physical examination which must include musculoskeletal system plus rectal examination. \n• \nInvestigate with ESR and/or CRP. \n• \nPolymyalgia rheumatica as the most likely diagnosis. \nCRITICAL ERROR  \n• Failure to request ESR and/or C-reactive protein.  \nCOMMENTARY \nPolymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis are linked conditions of unknown aetiology. The incidence varies with \nethnicity and these conditions are more common in people of Northern European descent. \nPolymyalgia rheumatica commonly presents in middle aged or elderly patients with diffuse symptoms of muscle pain \nparticularly in the neck, shoulders and hip girdles. The myalgia is symmetric and often begins in the shoulders. \nMuscle strength is normal but can appear diminished because of pain. There is often a disparity between the severity \nof myalgia reported and the physical findings. There are often constitutional symptoms including weight loss, malaise \nand depression; spiking fevers are rare. The diagnosis in this instance would be confirmed by investigations, \nspecifically ESR and C-reactive protein, and full blood examination (FBE). \n• \nTreatment of polymyalgia rheumatica is with oral prednisolone, initially in high dosage. \n• \nDifferential diagnosis to be considered would include: \n~ Chronic fatigue syndrome: This condition is a 'medically unexplained condition'. It is usually seen in younger \npatients, may follow a viral infection and the dominant feature is incapacitating fatigue with other medical \nsymptoms of subjective memory impairment, headaches, poor sleep, generalised muscle pains, \npostexertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours, lymph node tenderness. It is best viewed as a symptom \ncomplex resulting from interaction of physical and psychosocial factors. The ESR, CRP and FBE tests are \nnormal. \n~ 'Fibromyalgia': Another of the 'medically unexplained' conditions, characterised by aching pains across the \nshoulders and upper back, skin tenderness, poor sleep pattern and often additional constitutional symptoms. \nESR, CRP and FBE are normal. \n \n \n \n \n",

'  \nStory in Detail \nWithout prompting — you have felt tired and lethargic since you retired about a year ago You attributed this to a lack \nof mental stimulation from what was a demanding job. About three or four months ago you also noticed aches and \npains in your joints which have persisted. You also realised that you had lost some weight which is why you decided \nto see the doctor. You have just returned from holidays in Queensland. You have noticed that you have developed a \nsuntan even though you don't spend much time outdoors, and did not do much swimming on holiday. \nIn response to specific questions respond as indicated: \n• \nThe tiredness is constant and not improved by resting or sleeping (you sleep well). \n• \nThe aches and pains are mainly in your shoulders, hips and knees. There is some tenderness and swelling in \nwrists and elbows and pains in the shoulders. The muscles are not sore. \n• \nThe weight loss is 3-4 kg. \n• \nYou have also noticed palpitations at times — mainly when going off to sleep, when your heart seems to speed \nup and miss beats for a few minutes at a time. \n• \nYour sexual activity has been less than before; you thought due to your age. \n• \nYou don't feel depressed \n• \nIn response to all other questions deny any other symptoms. \n• \nYou do not smoke or drink any alcohol. \n• \nThere have been no significant past illnesses. \n• \nThere is no significant family history but you were adopted and know little about your \nparents. \n",

The additional symptoms of palpitations, change in skin colour \nand loss of libido, in the absence of other symptoms or significant past history, indicate there is a multisystem \ndisorder. However most candidates will require the examination findings to assist in the diagnostic formulation. \n \n• Examination requests should be made for specific diagnostic features. The examiner will respond to a request with \nthe following specifics: \n      ~ Distribution of hyperpigmentation — generalised over body but not mucos \n            ~ Joints \n    swelling and some tenderness of wrists, elbows and knees. \nLimitation of range of movements and tenderness of the \nshoulder joints \n~ Pulse \nirregular, atrial fibrillation, confirmed by office ECG \n~ Blood pressure                140/90 mmHg \n~ Heart \nno additional findings, no signs of cardiac failure. \n~ Abdomen \n5 cm enlargement of liver — firm nontender liver edge \n~ Genitalia \ntestes softer and smaller than usual for age \n~ Urine \npositive for glucose. Diabetes confirmed by random blood \nsugar of 12 mmol/L \n• Diagnosis/Differential diagnosis — The patient presents the classical clinical picture of haemochromatosis \n      ~ Other causes of increased pigmentation — Addison disease, Cushing disease, hyperthyroidism, cirrhosis, \nporphyria, chronic renal failure, malnutrition/malabsorption, drugs causing photosensitivity (for example, \npsoralens, phenothiazines, certain antibiotics, amiodarone). \n• Choice of investigations — The candidate should indicate the need for:  \n~ full blood examination and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. \n~ creatinine and electrolytes \n~ serum iron studies (especially transferrin saturation)  \n~ liver function tests \n~ test for gene for haemochromatosis (HFE) gene \nIf the candidate suspects haemochromatosis the next steps in the confirmation of the diagnosis should be explained \nto the patient. Details of treatment are not required in this case. Specialist referral would be expected for further \nassessment and management. \nIf the candidate does not recognise the significance of the constellation of symptoms and signs, their choice of \ninvestigations and/or referral will indicate the level of performance. \n",

The candidate should indicate the need to examine the pulse, cardiovascular system, abdomen and to \nlook for evidence of endocrine dysfunction. \n• \nDiagnosis/Differential diagnosis — the condition of haemochromatosis may not be apparent to the candidate \non the history and examination findings. However a consideration of the causes of the multisystem disease with \nskin pigmentation, arthritis, cardiac, liver, and endocrine systems disorder should be sensibly discussed. \n• \nChoice of investigations — these should be appropriate to the investigation of the multisystem disease. \nCRITICAL ERROR - none defined \nCOMMENTARY  \nIn primary haemochromatosis there is increased absorption of iron from a normal diet. Repeated blood transfusions \ncan cause secondary haemochromatosis. The primary form is an autosomal recessive condition, known also as \n'Bronze Diabetes'. \nThe homozygous state is present in 1:150 in Australia with 1 in 10 carriers (1 in 300 blood donors have iron overload) \nand is more common in people of Celtic or Northern European background. Typical manifestations are bronze skin \npigmentation, diabetes (60%), cardiomyopathy, liver damage and pituitary failure. Fatigue, arthralgia and abdominal \npain are leading symptoms, while detection of atrial fibrillation, hepatomegaly, testicular atrophy and hyperglycaemia \nmake a clinical diagnosis possible. \nThe critical confirmatory investigations are iron studies — serum iron, total iron binding capacity, ferritin, transferrin \nand transferrin saturation, plus testing for the gene for haemochromatosis (HFE gene). \n",

They are not \nexpected to take a further history from you. They have just finished taking a history. \nOn this occasion you vomited a large amount of fresh blood two hours ago — you think it might \nhave been a pint or so (500 ml_). You felt temporarily faint and broke into a sweat. You have not \nvomited since. Your wife has driven you to hospital where the Hospital Medical Officer (HMO) \nhas taken your history You are lying on the couch undressed to your underclothes and wearing a \nhospital gown. The HMO who has taken your history is about to examine you. \nYou have given a past history of a previous admission six months ago with a similar episode of \nvomiting blood which settled spontaneously, and you were discharged after a few days. You had \nan endoscopy through the mouth and you were told you had dilated veins at the lower end of the \noesophagus leading into the stomach. You were warned about the effects of continued drinking. \nYou've been trying to give this up but you have had limited success. It is likely that the candidates \nwill want to measure your blood pressure and feel the pulses in your arms. They will also \nexamine your hands, face, chest and abdomen. \nIn a patient with liver problems, the findings will be evident on examination, and will have been \npreviously checked by the examiner. \nEXPECTATIONS OF CANDIDATE PERFORMANCE \nCandidates should first look for evidence of haemodynamic compromise (looking for evidence of \nhypotension and postural drop, pulse, peripheral perfusion). Once candidates indicate they \nwould take the blood pressure, they can be told that the BP is 110/70 mmHg and pulse 90/min. \nAs the bleeding occurred only two hours ago, this assessment is particularly important. \nCandidates should indicate that they would do a rectal examination looking for a melaena stool, \nand will be informed there is a fresh melaena stool on the glove. \n",

      "text": "070 \nPerformance Guidelines \n \n \n \nProvided the patient is stable, a methodical examination may be undertaken to look for the cause of the haemorrhage. \nAlthough the patient's past history has suggested that the cause is alcoholic liver disease, portal hypertension and \nbleeding oesophageal varices, this should not be assumed as many patients with known varices will be bleeding from \nanother cause. The examination should look for: \n• signs associated with chronic liver disease: \n• signs of possible liver failure; \n• signs of portal hypertension; and \n• any other clues suggesting a different aetiology for the haemorrhage. \nSigns associated with chronic liver disease apart from hepatomegaly include nail changes (leukonychia), salivary \ngland enlargement, testicular atrophy, gynaecomastia and spider naevi. If the liver is failing, the patient may have \nascites and encephalopathic changes. Encephalopathy may have a variety of presentations, ranging from minor \nmental impairment and flap, through to coma. \nPortal hypertension may be manifest by the signs of hypersplenism (purpuric haemorrhage), splenomegaly and \ncollateral venous channels. The latter may be visible in the anterior abdominal wall as communications between the \numbilical vein and the epigastric venous channels flowing back into the systemic circulation. Of more sinister import \nare the oesophageal mucosal collaterals that form between the portal and azygos systems through decompression \nalong the left gastric (coronary) vein. \nOccasionally, the physical examination will reveal other signs that might be associated with haemorrhage, for \nexample, the hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia associated with the Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. \nVariations on this theme are also used, in which a real patient with liver disease is to be assessed after admission to \nthe ward and institution of an intravenous drip while blood is being typed and cross-matched. The instructions will in \nthat case state that the patient is now haemodynamically stable and the emphasis of the task is to assess the patient \nfor evidence of chronic liver disease, which is expected to be present.

      "text": "2-E: The Paediatric Consultation \n \nPeter J Vine \n'Children are not simply micro-adults, but have their own specific problems.' \nBeta Schick (1877-1967) \nThere are many very positive features about working with \nchildren — they are much less complex than adults and usually \nunder most clinical situations have only one presenting \ncomplaint, unencumbered by a series of complicating past \nevents or of age-related disease. \nMedical care and assessment of children is often a \nmultidisciplinary process. Contrary to popular \nRecognition of the features \nin the history and in the \nclinical signs that indicate \nthat a child is significantly ill \nis a skill that must be \ndeveloped by anyone caring \nbelief in some circles, children are not just scaled-down adults, but rather their needs are under \nthe influence of a variety of variable factors, all of which have a profound effect on the \ndevelopment of the child as he or she progresses to adulthood. All of these influences therefore \nmust be taken into account when consulting with children and these vary depending on the age \nof the child. \nChildren in Australia have generally been spared the traumas experienced by their peers in third \nworld countries, or those torn apart and disrupted by war and natural disaster. Refugee children \ncome from other lands rather than our own, and have their own problems related to this \nbackground. However within our indigenous populations, the health of the children often is \nequivalent to those in developing countries — with high infant mortality, a high incidence of \nconditions uncommonly seen in the urban populations (for example, rheumatic fever), and a \nreduced adult life span, \nAustralia is a multicultural nation with 25% of the population being born overseas according to \nthe latest Census.\n1 Many children are first generation Australians born in this country to \nimmigrant parents. Our capital cities in particular have people from many nations residing in \nthem who have cultural beliefs and practices of which doctors need to be aware. Except in the \ncase of older children where the direct history from the child is most appropriate, the paediatric \nhistory is usually given by a third person, commonly a parent or caregiver. Often with new \narrivals, the history is given by yet another intermediary, an interpreter, who may or may not be a \nrelative, which may add yet another dimension to the consultation. \nMany medical practitioners admit to being rather frightened at the prospect of caring for children, \nas the process is so different from that related to adults where the history is obtained from the \npatients themselves. Other doctors are apprehensive at being able to perform an adequate \nexamination of a child. Nowhere else in medicine is it so essential to have expert observation \nskills than in paediatrics. Many diagnoses can be made just by observation of the child while the \nhistory is obtained, before any formal examination is performed. \nRecognition of the features in the history and in the clinical signs that indicate that a child is \nsignificantly ill is a skill that must be developed by anyone caring for children. While they do \nbecome ill quickly and, if untreated, deteriorate more rapidly than adults, children also repair and \nrecover quickly. It is imperative that if any child is not improving at a time when improvement is \nexpected, an immediate investigation into what might be complicating the situation must be \ninstigated. \n \n1 Australian Bureau of Statistics 2005 \n397 \n",

      "text": "398 \n2-E \nThe Paediatric Consultation \n \n \n \nWhile many illnesses seen in children also occur in adults (for example, asthma) the requisite skill is knowing the \nvariations that must be considered in the child which will influence future management. An example is the method of \nadministering bronchodilator therapy in young children. While the same medications are used, their methods of \nadministration are very different, with small volume spacers and masks designed for very young children. \nThere are also many conditions that are specific to children, for example hypertrophic pyloric stenosis and cystic \nfibrosis — although the latter has now become an adult disease, and adult practitioners need to be aware of \nmanagement of this condition. While intussusception can occur in adults in later years, secondary to a number of \nbowel lesions, 'primary' intussusception is a very prominent condition in infants, which must be considered in any \ninfant presenting with colicky abdominal pain. In this country, the majority of children seen in clinical practice present \nwith relatively minor complaints, but practitioners must always be vigilant for the circumstances when they should be \nconsidering more complex conditions specific to infants and children. Such situations are usually recognised from the \nhistory or the appearance of the child on examination. Beware of the listless infant or child who allows you to perform \nany examination you wish. This is usually a very sick child. \nPrescription of drugs is also different in children: most drugs are given on a mg per kg basis up to a certain weight and \nage. Similarly intravenous and oral fluids are calculated on a mL per kilogram basis and need to be calculated \ncarefully for each child. Specific pocket handbooks with this information are published by several of the major \nAustralian paediatric teaching hospitals. \nThe needs of children to develop their potential and to remain in good health are legion. While we practise in a \nso-called developed country, we still have a significant percentage of our child population who live in extremely \nadverse circumstances, whether these relate to poor nutrition, poor socioeconomic circumstances, poor parenting \nskills, harmful emotional environment or even deprivation. Many primary schools arrange breakfast for their pupils as \nfor one reason or another the children leave home for school having not eaten. \nAs each year goes by, the needs of the child change. Many parents find it difficult to provide for those needs, to the \ndetriment of the child's development. The general practitioner is often an appropriate person to assess this situation. \nUnfortunately all too commonly children in our country are the subjects of abuse, whether it be physical, sexual or \nemotional, and the medical practitioner needs to be alert to this possibility, especially when the presentation is at \nodds with what is observed. Australian law mandates that in each suspicious case, the relevant appropriate \nauthorities are to be notified. \nAs is typical of the industrialised countries, the spectrum of conditions seen by medical practitioners has changed \ndramatically over the last couple of decades. Rather than malnutrition, many of the problems we see are related to \ninappropriate nutritional habits and inactivity leading to obesity. \nEmotional and behavioural problems are common and often relate to the child's life experiences.1 Some situations \nthat may influence these are: \n• many children under two years of age participate in formal child care while parents work, almost a necessity for \nmaintaining a suitable income: \n                                                     \n1 Practical Paediatrics Ed.

      "text": "399 \n2-E \nThe Paediatric Consultation \n• the extended family in many communities is scattered and less accessible, as young adults move freely around the \ncountry seeking employment; \n• one in five children will experience divorce of their parents before mid teens; \n• a significant percentage of children live in one-parent families; many in two-parent families live in very unhappy \ncircumstances; \n• with the higher divorce rate, blended families, where children from previous marriages live together, can often be a \nsource of major conflict. Having two 13-year-old females suddenly living together can be quite trying; and \n• tobacco and/or alcohol use, especially binge drinking, is common in teenagers, and most high school students are \naware of where they can obtain cannabis and other drugs. \nYears ago, Dr Howard Williams of Melbourne, a mentor to many practising Australian paediatricians and one of the \nforerunners of paediatrics in this country, used to urge his postgraduate students to be aware of 'the new morbidity'. He \nstated that his generation had overcome much of the infectious disease morbidity and mortality with antibiotics and \nimmunisation, but that behaviour problems, disrupted families and the effect on the children involved would be a major \npart of the work of the modern practitioner. How right he was, as much of the consultation time of paediatricians in this \ncountry is taken up with oppositional defiant behaviour, attention deficit disorder, and other developmental behavioural \nproblems. \nMuch of this may be related to the sociological change in child rearing. Children of today largely depend on artificial \nmedia for entertainment in their spare time — television, cinema, electronic games, many of which require little if any \nintellectual skills and commonly have a strong base of violence and aggression. Add to this a high divorce rate and the \nloss in many instances of the extended family and the scene may be ripe for acting-out behaviour. \nThe physical and emotional needs of the growing child must therefore be kept to the fore when children are being \nassessed. The presentation of a child with an emotional problem can be quite varied and commonly may be \norganically based, so that the practitioner must be very alert to this possibility. \nThe care of the disabled child, whether it is a physical or intellectual disability, often falls to the primary practitioner for \nday-to-day events. Detailed knowledge of rare conditions is not generally necessary, but the support given to parents \nas they advocate for their offspring can be a major role asked of the practitioner. Advice concerning screening \nprocedures and genetics is also a common question, which the practitioner should refer to a higher authority, as the \nexplosion of knowledge in these fields is occurring at such an alarming rate that it has outstripped the ability of most of \nus to keep up-to-date. \nThe internet has revolutionised the practice of medicine, including paediatrics, as parents consult the internet for \nadvice on conditions their children are reported to have. Often parents may self-diagnose based on this information, \nbut generally present with their downloaded information asking for explanation of the contents. Many sites \nunfortunately are inaccurate and anecdotal. Hence the practitioner's role often is to sift through this information and to \ngive an accurate précis of the particular condition. \nA complete history, examination and discussion with a parent of a child's problem can take considerable time. In the \nAMC MCAT examination, only certain aspects will be examined in any one scenario. For example, the task may \ninvolve coming to a diagnosis from the information supplied and then counselling a parent on the management of the \nchild's condition. Or it may be taking a focused history to determine the cause of the presentation. \n",

      "text": "407 \n074 \nPerformance Guidelines \n \n \n \nCOMMENTARY  \nThe dominant cue in this example is neonatal jaundice in the first day of life. \nJaundice occurs frequently in the neonatal period, but when seen on the first day of life, it indicates a pathological and \npotentially dangerous rise in bilirubin level. In the common, so-called 'physiological jaundice', the serum bilirubin rises \nmore slowly, and jaundice is not apparent on the first day. \nHaemolytic disease is the most common cause of potentially dangerous neonatal jaundice. As it is readily treatable, \nand complications potentially avoidable, early diagnosis is mandatory. Hyperbilirubinaemia is likely to reach a \nmaximum level around the third day of life. \nThere is a diagnostic rule that 'jaundice on the first day of life is haemolytic unless \nproven otherwise' This originated in the days when Rh haemolytic disease was a common cause. The jaundice of \nthe affected infant could increase rapidly, so immediate diagnosis and often exchange transfusion were required to \navoid the serious complication of kernicterus or later nerve deafness. The candidate familiar with this rule will \nimmediately refine the cue to: 'Jaundice on the first day of life, probably haemolytic' This scenario is an example \nof the need for pattern recognition where urgent diagnosis is required. \nTo frame the problem more clearly, the clinician needs to seek evidence confirming the existence of haemolysis and \ndefining the degree of hyperbilirubinaemia. The protocol states that hepatosplenomegaly is not present. This makes \nthe severe intrauterine haemolysis seen in some cases of Rh haemolytic disease less likely, but does not exclude less \ndramatic forms of haemolysis. \nThe crucial laboratory tests in establishing the diagnosis are examination of blood group of mother and infant, and \ndirect Coombs test. The scenario of a group O Positive mother and a group A Positive infant indicates the potential for \nthe infant's blood to be harmed by maternal anti-A antibody. The positive direct Coombs test confirms that the infant's \nred cells have been sensitised by antibody and establishes the diagnosis of haemolytic disease due to AO \nincompatibility. \nIn deciding management and providing further confirmation of the diagnosis, estimation of serum bilirubin level \n(direct-reacting and indirect-reacting) should be performed. Bilirubin is derived from the catabolism of haeme proteins \nproduced in the breakdown of red blood cells. Unconjugated (indirect-reacting) bilirubin is converted in the liver to \nconjugated (direct-reacting) bilirubin, and excreted into the bile. Conjugated bilirubin is not reabsorbed once it enters \nthe intestinal tract. In the present scenario, the level of bilirubin is insufficient to warrant exchange transfusion, but the \nclinical picture, combined with laboratory confirmation of an unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia exceeding 240 umol/L, \nconfirms the need for treatment with phototherapy. \nThe degree of haemolysis should be defined by measuring the infant's haemoglobin, though simple transfusion for \ncorrection of the anaemia will rarely be required in AO haemolytic disease and is not needed here. \nIn this scenario, discussion of other haemolytic or nonhaemolytic causes of neonatal jaundice is not required once the \nproblem is correctly framed as 'jaundice on the first day of life'. \nAs indicated in the examiners' 'Performance Criteria', the candidate is not only expected to make the diagnosis, but to \nprovide information in a persuasive and lucid manner to justify medical intervention, while recognising the mother's \ndisappointment. \n",

Can we leave it \nout\n9' \n• \n'What other side effects happen with these vaccines\n9' \n• \n'What if we didn't give these vaccines — can't you just treat any infections with \nantibiotics anyway?' \n• \n‘I have a friend who goes to a homoeopath and he gives the same vaccines, but \nvery diluted, by mouth and there are no side effects. Is that an alternative?' \n• \n'What about other alternative vaccines?' \n• \n'I've heard babies can get high fever and be guite sick after some of these \ninjections.

In the future, combination vaccines which \nwill reduce the number of injections are expected and small variations to the schedule will be \nneeded to accommodate these.

What is being tested in this scenario is \nwhether the candidate is aware of the general principles for DTP, Hib, polio, hepB, MMR, \nmeningococcus, pneumococcus, chicken pox. \nCandidates should address specific concerns that the mother may have regarding possible side \neffects and the incidence of these.

Also stress the marked decrease in the incidence of side \neffects with the use of acellular vaccines for pertussis. \nCandidates should discuss the few absolute contraindications to vaccination. These are \nencephalopathy within seven days of a previous DTP-containing vaccine or an immediate severe \nor anaphylactic reaction to vaccination with DTP. A simple febrile convulsion or preexisting \nneurologic disease are not contraindications to pertussis vaccine. \nChildren with minor illnesses, i.e. without systemic illness and providing the temperature is less \nthan 38.5 \"C, may be vaccinated safely. With a major illness or a high fever, the vaccination \nshould be postponed until the child is well. \nLive vaccines (MMR, oral poliomyelitis, rubella, chicken pox) should not be administered to \nimmunocompromised patients. An anaphylactic reaction to egg is not a contraindication to MMR \nvaccine, but many authorities recommend that in such a case it should be administered in an area \nwhere resuscitative equipment is available and the child be observed for 4 hours. \nThe following are NOT contraindications to any of the vaccines in the standard schedule: \n• family history of adverse reactions to immunisation; \n• family history of convulsions; \n• previous pertussis-like illness, measles, mumps or rubella infection; \n• prematurity (immunisation should not be delayed); \n",

This requires of candidates a sound knowledge of the topic and \nan ability to give the information to the parent in a manner that gives a balanced overview, \nwithout domineering with their own personal feelings. This is a very common situation in general \npractice where patients will often attend to discuss with the doctor, beliefs they have, or to seek \nfurther information on a topic. Doctors should not hesitate to admit that they do not know a \nparticular answer but should offer to seek the answer and communicate it at a later date. \nUpdated immunisation schedules such as the one illustrated are available from paediatric \nhospitals. \nCandidates should be aware of the absolute contraindications to the standard vaccinations and \nalso the false contraindications which are so often quoted. \n",

FIGUR\nAcute tonsilitis \nE\nEXPECTATIONS OF CANDIDATE PERFORMANCE \nThe candidate should enquire as to the important clinical findings on examination allowing confident diagnosis of \nacute tonsillitis, most likely bacterial. A throat swab could help confirm this prior to antibiotic treatment. The candidate \nshould be able to explain in simple terms the diagnosis and its associated complications in a manner that the parent \ncan understand; and should also arrange for further review in a few days to ensure the expected recovery is occurring \nand if not, review and possibly seek other aetiologies. \nExplanation of diagnosis \nAcute tonsillitis, probably streptococcal. Reassure that with appropriate treatment this should resolve completely. \nImmediate management \nThe candidate may wish to perform a throat swab for culture (appropriate but not obligatory). There is no need for any \nother investigations at this stage. Check whether antibiotic reaction previously, and prescribe oral penicillin. Advise \nthe mother of need for frequent fluids. Prescribe analgesics. \nAlthough the problem might be viral and settle without antibiotics, the majority opinion would be that penicillin therapy \nis indicated because of the high likelihood of the diagnosis being streptococcal tonsillitis. If the candidate does not \nrecommend antibiotic therapy the mother should ask whether antibiotics are needed. \nAntibiotic therapy would not only treat the streptococcal sore throat but would probably reduce the likelihood of \nserious poststreptococcal complications. \nFuture management \nSuggest review in few days or earlier if concerned and if the child has not responded as expected. If this is the case, \nother aetiologies (e.g. infectious mononucleosis) should be sought. Stress that a full course of 10 days penicillin \ntreatment is required. Indicate that viral infection may cause similar features, as might acute infectious \nmononucleosis. \n415 \n",

The type of breech presentation (extended \nlegs) is a favourable one. and as she is keen to avoid a Caesarean section delivery, an attempt \nat vaginal breech delivery would be appropriate. \n• X-ray pelvimetry is unnecessary in view of the size of her previous baby (4000 g) which was \nborn at 41 weeks of gestation. Although second babies are likely to be bigger than the first \none. the current baby is being delivered three weeks earlier than the preceding one which \nmeans it should be smaller than the previous child \n• Cardiotocography (CTG) monitoring is necessary in association with breech presentation as \nthere is an increased risk of cord prolapse associated with this abnormal presentation. Vaginal \nexamination as soon as the membranes rupture, to exclude cord prolapse and confirm the \ntype of breech presentation, is also mandatory. \n• As she is in labour, ultrasound examination will probably be difficult to arrange urgently Had \nthe breech presentation been diagnosed prior to labour, ultrasound would have been of value \nto check fetal size, type of breech presentation, and whether the fetal neck was extended. \n• Caesarean section would be indicated if there was slow progress of labour, or if breech \nextraction was considered required to effect delivery because of fetal distress or inadequate \nprogress, or a significant CTG abnormality occurred in the first stage of labour. \n• A successful outcome of labour can be anticipated with the findings which are evident in this \npatient. However about 3-5% of patients do have problems during the latter stages of delivery \ndue to difficulty delivering the legs, arms or head. \n \nKEY ISSUES \n•   Ability of the candidate to advise and counsel a patient of the current options in regard to \nbreech delivery by vaginal or Caesarean delivery. \n \nCRITICAL ERRORS \n• Failure to advise of the appropriate risks of vaginal breech delivery \n• Recommending that external cephalic version should be attempted despite the fact she is in \nlabour. \n• Indicating to the patient that vaginal breech delivery is absolutely contraindicated despite her \ndesires. \n \nCOMMENTARY \nApproximately 4% of all babies present by the breech, and vaginal delivery is safe in selected \npatients. This particularly applies where the baby is of normal size (between 2.5 and 4.0 kg); the \nbreech presentation is a complete breech or a breech with extended legs: the fetal neck is not \nextended; where labour occurs spontaneously and progresses at the appropriate rate; and where \nthe pelvic dimensions are normal. \n",

      "text": "431 \n080 \nPerformance Guidelines \n \n \n \nEXPECTATIONS OF CANDIDATE PERFORMANCE \nThe candidate should convey the substance of what follows to the patient: \n• The diagnosis is endometrial atrophy due to the progestogen component of the OCP \n(Microgynon 30\nM). \n• There is no real problem with the progestogen-induced secondary amenorrhoea except for the \nanxiety it produces in the patient about whether she is pregnant. When the oral contraceptive \npill is ceased, all will return to normal, including her fertility. \n• A pregnancy is most unlikely but a p-hCG estimation should be done to confirm this for the \npatient. \n• If she is really worried about the amenorrhoea, the pill could be changed to either a \nhigher-oestrogen-containing pill (such as Microgynon 50®), or a triphasic pill (Triquilar®), and \nthe menstrual loss may increase. The other option would be for her to have a break from the \noral contraceptive pill and use some other method of contraception. \nIf the assessment of oestradiol, FSH, LH or prolactin levels is suggested, this would \nsuggest little or no insight into the cause of the amenorrhoea or the effect of the OCP on \nthese hormone test results. \n \nKEY ISSUES \n• Ability to diagnose the cause of amenorrhoea when on the OCP. \n• Ability to counsel the patient appropriately. \n \nCRITICAL ERROR \n•   Failure to perform a pregnancy test (/J-hCG) to exclude the unlikely possibility of a pregnancy \noccurring whilst taking the OCP. \n \nCOMMENTARY \nThe reduction in the amount of of withdrawal bleeding whilst a patient is on the oral contraceptive \npill is not uncommon. The cause is due to a progressive endometrial atrophy (progestogen \n-induced) over the period of time the patient is taking the pill. The key to the situation is generally \nthe history of gradual reduction of menstrual flow over a period of time prior to the complete \ncessation of withdrawal bleeding. Whilst the likelihood of pregnancy is very low, a pregnancy test \nis appropriate to reassure the patient — as conception is possible whilst a patient is taking the \noral contraceptive pill. Common problems likely with candidate performance are: \n• Inadequate history concerning the progressive reduction in the menstrual loss whilst on the \nOCP. \n• Inadequate advice concerning the natural history of this symptom after cessation of the OCP. \n",

Although a low risk situation, consensus best practice is to treat all GBS positive patients during labour. \nTreatment with parenteral penicillin should be commenced in labour or if membranes rupture prior to onset of \nlabour. The antibiotic crosses the placenta and protects the baby. It is extremely unlikely that the baby will become \ninfected under such a regimen. \n• Some obstetric units only give antibiotics to 'high risk' patients in labour, such as those in premature labour, those \nwith premature rupture of the membranes, or where there is a maternal fever. Candidates should be aware that \nsuch a management protocol does however put about 0.5% of babies at significant risk where the mother is GBS \npositive. \n",

It is important to \nknow that approximately 10-15% of pregnant women will be colonised with Group B \nstreptococcus organisms at this stage.

Investigations will need to be done \nto confirm or exclude pregnancy and then define whether the pregnancy, if present, is \nprogressing satisfactorily. \nAn appropriate plan of investigations would be: \n• β-hCG to check if pregnant. \n• If β -hCG is negative, the diagnosis is just a late period, therefore observe. If periods remain \nirregular, hormonal tests to see if fertility treatment is required may subsequently need to be \nconsidered (such as FSH, LH, PRL, TFTs). \n• If β -hCG is positive, check β -hCG level to assess usefulness of ultrasound examination. \n• If β -hCG is positive and greater than 1000 U/L, she needs an ultrasound to check the site and \nnormality of the pregnancy, and the gestation and due date. \n• When all of these results are known it will be necessary to review her. The prognosis regarding \nthe pregnancy can be discussed when it is known what the results are. \n• If she is pregnant, the diagnosis is probably a threatened miscarriage, and no hormonal \ntherapy is likely to be of value. \n \nKEY ISSUES \n• Ability to evaluate a patient with bleeding after amenorrhoea. \n• Ability to confirm or exclude pregnancy as a cause. \n \nCRITICAL ERRORS \n• Failure to consider non-pregnancy as well as pregnancy causes. \n• Failure to arrange ultrasound if pregnant and β -hCG is greater than 1000 U/L. \n \nCOMMENTARY \nThis is a situation where bleeding occurs some eight weeks after a previous period but where the \npatient often has an irregular cycle when amenorrhoea may last up to eight weeks.

      "text": "436 \n2-G: The Psychiatric Consultation \n \nFrank P Hume \n'The care of the human mind is the most noble branch of medicine.' \nAloysius Sieffert (c. 1858) \nA psychiatric assessment is a structured clinical conversation, complemented by observation and mental \nstate examination and supplemented by a physical examination and the interview of other informants when \nappropriate. After the initial interview, the clinician should be able to establish whether the individual has a \nmental health problem or not, the nature of the problem and a plan for the most suitable treatment. A \nthorough initial assessment may take an hour or more to complete, but when time is short it may be \nnecessary to focus on the immediate problems at first and schedule a longer followup appointment to round \noff the evaluation. In the context of the AMC assessment, with the time constraints imposed, the tasks are \nsplit and focused to allow completion in the time period allowed. \nFor trust and rapport to develop, the clinician must display tact, empathy and genuine respect for the \nindividual's dignity throughout the interview. A private setting is crucial with comfortable seating and \nambience and freedom from interruptions. Confidentiality is central, given the personal and intimate nature \nof the material to be talked about, but it is not absolute when the safety and interests of the patient or others \nare at issue, or in medicolegal consultations. \nComprehensive and contemporaneous case notes are essential. Whenever possible, notes should be taken \nduring the interview rather than relying on recall afterwards. However note-taking should be delayed at the \noutset until the patient feels that he or she has the clinician's attention. If the patient is highly anxious, \nagitated, hostile or paranoid it maybe sensible to defer note-taking until after the interview and limit the \namount of factual information at the first interview. \nClinicians should begin by welcoming patients by name, introducing themselves if unknown, greeting \ncompanions if the patient is accompanied and explaining how long they may have to wait and whether they \nwill be interviewed. It is usual to interview the patient alone first and other informants afterwards, with the \npatient's consent. Let the patient know from the outset how long the interview is likely to take and that you will \nbe taking notes at some stage (which are confidential) \nBegin with basic census data: contact details, education, occupation and languages spoken. If the interview \nis to be conducted in a language other than English, then a trained health service interpreter should be \nused rather than an accompanying relative or friend, depending on the sensitivity and intimacy of the \ninformation to be gathered. Experienced interpreters will repeat patient's replies word for word, even if they \nare obviously delusional or thought-disordered, whereas well-meaning relatives may paraphrase or \nsubstitute replies to compensate for confused or disordered responses. When using an interpreter, direct \nyour attention and your enquiries to the patient and not the interpreter. \nThe interview should commence with the history of the presenting complaint by asking an open-ended \nquestion such as 'please tell me about your problems in your own words'. The patient should then be allowed \nto talk spontaneously and without interruption for several minutes, with the clinician maintaining appropriate \neye contact, paying attention to the factual content whilst simultaneously monitoring the patient's verbal and \nnonverbal behaviour. Encouraging the patients to 'go on' or 'tell me more are simple strategies to put them at \nease, as are nodding, leaning forwards, expressing concern or repeating key \n",

When there is time pressure or urgency to make treatment or \nadmission decisions, then the clinician may need to be more active or directive from the \nbeginning and use more closed questions (requiring just 'yes' or 'no' answers) \nGood clinicians should be able to: \n• put an anxious patient at ease; \n• gain sufficient trust to encourage an unwilling or suspicious patient to discuss relevant issues \nby displaying tact, patience and encouragement: \n• be comfortable, tolerant and empathie when a patient becomes tearful during the interview; \n• know how to set limits if patients become angry, hostile or abusive; \n• recognise and respect patient-clinician boundaries especially with dependent, disinhibited, \noverfamiliar or adulatory patients; \n• politely interject and refocus garrulous patients, explaining that because of time restraints it \nmay be necessary to break into their flow of conversation from time to time to concentrate on \nthe points that are important for planning treatment: \n• rapidly identify patients who are demented, disorganised, disorientated, intoxicated, grossly \npsychotic or dysphasic and for whom other informants will be imperative; and \n• become aware of and monitor their own countertransference responses to particular patients. \nBy being aware of your own prejudices, weaknesses, blind spots and personal vulnerabilities, \nand recognising when patients arouse strong feelings of anger, boredom sexual excitement or \n'rescue' fantasies in you, you are accordingly less likely to react inappropriately to them \nA psychiatric assessment differs from other medical interviews in that more attention needs to be \npaid to the patient's psychological and social influences. Accordingly, patients' cultural and \nspiritual backgrounds, formative influences, important relationships, significant life events and \ntheir reactions to them; their attitudes, values and beliefs about themselves, other people and the \nworld may all be explored in the course of an assessment. \nA vertical time line can be used to summarise key events in a person's life from what follows \n(which is not comprehensive). \nAfter the history of the present complaint has been established, then the family history should be \nreviewed with a family tree or genogram developed as far back as the grandparents. The quality \nof the relationship of each family member with the patient and its stability over time, parental \noccupations, family status and atmosphere, familial diseases and illnesses, family psychiatric \ndisorders (and treatment) should all be recorded. \n",

Common sense and experience should inform the clinician about what is relevant to each \npatient as a picture emerges during the interview. \nIn structured assessments at undergraduate level, scenarios must be selective and \nfocused with clear aims and guidelines, to enable appropriate candidate assessment over \na brief eight minute doctor-patient encounter. \nMENTAL STATE EXAMINATION \nHistory-taking deals with the past while mental state \nexamination is a systematic review of the patient's present \nsymptoms and observed behaviour during the interview. It is a \ncross-sectional view of the patient and is one of the essential \nelements of psychiatric practice. The principles of the mental \nstate assessment can readily be incorporated into the \nexamination of any patient. \n439 \nRecording mental state begins with: \nAppearance and behaviour \nA comprehensive, accurate and lifelike word-picture \nof how the patient looks in terms of appearance, body size, \ngrooming, \ndress, \nposture, \nmovement \nand \nfacial \nexpressiveness. Behaviour refers to cooperation, body language and gestures, psychomotor \nfunction and general activity and social relatedness during the interview. Orientation, mood, \nanxiety, hallucinations and medication may all influence appearance and behaviour. \nMental state examination is a \nsystematic review of the \npatient's present symptoms \nand observed behaviour \nduring the interview. It is a \ncross-sectional view of the \npatient and is one of the \nessential elements of \npsychiatric practice. The \nprinciples of the mental state \nassessment can readily be \nincorporated into the \nSpeech \nThe rate, volume, quality, quantity and tone of speech are recorded. Dysarthria or dysphasia are \nnoted. The form of the patient's talk is considered rather than the content: spontaneity, \npressure, slowness, hesitancy, coherence, looseness, response latency unusual sentence \nconstruction e.g. Yoda the Jedi in Star Wars, neologisms (made up words), repetitions and \ndistractibility. \nMood and affect \nMood refers to a person's usual or longterm feeling state. Affect is a more short-term and \nimmediate feeling state and refers to what is observed by the clinician during the interview. \n‘Mood is to affect as climate is to weather’. Clues to mood assessment arise from the patient's \nappearance, mobility, posture and behaviour. Patients could be asked \nHow do you feel in yourself?' or \n'What is your mood like?' or \n‘How about your spirits?' \nTo assess depression ask about unhappiness, sadness, tearfulness, pessimism about the \npresent, shame or guilt about the past and hopelessness about the future. \n",

Patients who are depressed and suicidal may be alarmed and frightened by their \nthoughts and are relieved that someone cares enough to ask what they may be thinking about. \nMost suicidal patients do not want to kill themselves and find the thoughts repugnant, but may feel \nit is the only solution to their anguish. Some genuinely suicidal patients may deny being suicidal \nwhen asked, because they are determined to succeed and do not wish to be thwarted or prevented \nfrom doing so. \nTo assess elation or hypomania ask \n'Do you ever/often feel in unusually good spirits?' \n'Do you ever/often feel on top of the world or full of energy?' \n'Do you ever/often get racing thoughts?' \n'Do you ever/often go on uncontrolled spending sprees that leave you in debt?’ \n       'Do you often feel unusually confident, inventive, fabulous or famous?' \nOther mood states that may be specifically enquired about include anxiety, anger, irritability, envy, \nsuspiciousness and perplexity. \nThe range of mood should be described as normal, increased, labile, restricted or blunted. Also \nnote whether it is constant or stable. \nAppropriateness of affect means that the current emotional expression matches what is being said \nat the time. \nDepersonalisation and derealisation experiences are difficult for patients to describe. They may \ndescribe feeling unreal or detached, emotionless and numb, or as //'they are acting a part or being \nlike a robot. Alternatively they may describe their environment as colourless, lifeless, artificial or \ncartoon-like. The feelings may vary from mild to severe, but are always seen as alien, unwanted \nand unpleasant. All or any part of the body may be involved and the feelings may be intermittent or \npersistent. They are usually accompanied by anxiety and/or depression. \nThought form \nAbnormalities of thought can only be inferred from what patients say or write and may be \ninfluenced by mood or psychosis. Depressed patients may have slowed speech with no rhythm or \ncadence and only give limited or monosyllabic replies after a pause and with a limited range of \ntopics or themes. Manic patients speak very rapidly and their train of thought may shift repeatedly \n(flight of ideas). They may be difficult to interrupt and their flight of ideas may be triggered by a pun \nor a clang association — where the sound of a word is rhymed with another word midsentence to \nproduce a different set of ideas. \nLoosening of associations is the classic formal thought disorder of schizophrenia. A patient may \nsay a lot but it is impossible to grasp the meaning of what is being said. Attempts to clarify with \nfollowup questions often only deepen the puzzle, because there is a loss of the normal clarity and \nstructure of thinking. Examples of disorganised speech should be recorded verbatim. \n",

Obsessional patients may be anxious not to leave any doubt about their replies and qualify and \nexhaustively explore every detail and nuance before they get to the point. \nTangentiality is an oblique or irrelevant response to a straightforward question. \nConcrete thinking is a literal and restricted response to a basic question, for example, 'How \nare you feeling today?'.................' With my fingers and toes, as usual! ' ........................... or1 You 're the doctor. \nyou tell me!' \nThought content \nA delusion is a false belief which is out of keeping with an individuals educational, cultural, religious and social \nbackground which is held with extraordinary and unshakeable conviction and absolute certainty. Subjectively, it is \nindistinguishable from a true belief and it is not influenced by rational argument or evidence to the contrary. A delusion \nmay arise spontaneously (out of the blue), or be a secondary response to a patient's mood hallucinatory experiences \nor false memories. \nParanoid (persecutory) delusions are the most common. Grandiose, guilty, nihilistic, jealousy, religious, \nhypochondriacal, sexual, control, and referential delusions also occur. Specific delusions about one's thoughts, \ninvolving either thought insertion, withdrawal or broadcasting are pathognomonic of schizophrenia. \nAn overvalued idea is usually a solitary abnormal belief which dominates a patient's life and causes disturbed \nfunctioning and suffering to the person or others. The patient's whole life may revolve around this one idea (e.g. \nanorexia nervosa, body dysmorphic disorder, transsexualism), and cause irreparable harm to significant relationships \nin the patient's life. \nObsessions are recurrent, intrusive, irrational thoughts, impulses or images that persist despite efforts to exclude or \nresist them. They are recognised as being self-generated and nonsensical and usually deal with issues that the patient \nfinds disturbing or unpleasant (e.g. dirt, germs, violence, sex, illness or religion). \nPerception \nPerception is the process of integrating input either from the sense organs or from imagery and fantasy (which are \nself-generated). It is influenced by mood: mania heightens perception, particularly of colours; anxiety may intensify \nsound; depression mutes sound and dulls colour. Schizophrenia may affect olfaction and taste. \nAn illusion is the misinterpretation of a real stimulus and is more likely to occur when attention and concentration are \nunfocused, or when anxiety is high. \nHallucinations are false perceptions in the absence of a stimulus. They have the full force and impact of a real \nperception and occur spontaneously and cannot be controlled or terminated by self-will. To patients, hallucinations are \nnormal sensory experiences. They may be simple: experience of bangs, rattles, whistles or flashes of light: or \ncomplex: hearing voices, music, faces, animals or scenes. \nAuditory hallucinations are characteristic of schizophrenia, but can also occur in alcoholism, amphetamine psychosis \nand affective disorder. Voices in schizophrenia may be single or multiple; whisper or shout or speak in normal \nconversational tone: give a running commentary on the patient's behaviour; argue with each other or appear to speak \nor echo the patient's thoughts out loud. Usually the patient is referred to in the third person (he or she), but \noccasionally commands and orders are given in the second person (you). \n",

Blind or deaf people may hallucinate images or sounds. \nVisual hallucinations usually signify organic illness and are uncommon in schizophrenia. Substance abuse \n(hallucinogens, glue, alcohol), neurological disorders affecting the visual pathways or the occipital lobe, \npostconcussional states, temporal lobe epilepsy and various forms of dementia may cause visual hallucinations. \nTactile, haptic (touch-related) or somatic hallucinations may occur in acute psychosis and often have a bizarre \ncomplexity. Perceptions of heat, touch, water dripping (or blood or bodily fluids); visceral sensations of severe pain \ncaused by 'knives' or 'demons': or of formication (the sensation of ants or insects crawling on or under the skin), have \nall been described. They may be more indicative of benzodiazepine, cocaine or alcohol withdrawal. Olfactory and \ngustatory hallucinations are rare, usually occur together and although they may occur in schizophrenia or depressive \ndisorders, are more likely due to temporal lobe phenomena or neurological lesions of the olfactory pathways. \nCognition \nCognitive function should be assessed briefly in every patient and interpreted in relationship to age, education and \nintelligence. Orientation, attention, concentration and short-term, recent and remote memory should be tested. If \nimpairment is suspected or revealed, then a more structured and objective review of cognitive functioning, such as the \nMini-Mental State Examination, should be performed. \nInsight \nInsight refers to the self-awareness of morbid experiences (symptoms), and their effect on personal functioning and \nrelationships. It also encompasses attitudes to assessment, mental disorder and treatment. Insight is not simply \npresent or absent, but depends on the degree to which patients acknowledge, or are aware of. phenomena that other \npeople (including the clinician) have drawn to their attention. Insight depends next on the degree to which patients \nrecognise that the phenomena are abnormal, or may have a psychological or psychiatric cause, and finally whether \npatients are willing to have treatment or be hospitalised. In psychotic disorders, insight is usually absent or partial at \nbest. \nRapport \nRapport refers to the degree of relatedness between the patient and the clinician during the interview and is a \nmeasure of the quality of the communication and trust achieved. Difficulty in establishing rapport may be symptomatic \nof the patient's illness or the clinician's countertransference and lack of empathy. Rapport predicts whether a patient \nwill engage in and continue treatment. \nRisk \nDepending on the circumstances, the clinician's assessment of the patient's suicidalityand risk of violence to others \nshould be noted and then acted upon, if appropriate. \nReliability \nWhenever there is any doubt about the veracity of the patient's account of symptoms or behaviour change and other \nautobiographical details, other informants should be interviewed \n",

This applies particularly to patients who are cognitively impaired, disorganised, intoxicated, \nsignificantly thought-disordered or affectively distressed. \nTHE MINI-MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION (MMSE) \nThe MMSE was developed by Marshal Folstein and colleagues from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in \nBaltimore. Since its publication in 1975 it has become the most commonly used instrument for bedside cognitive \nfunction screening. Its purpose is not to make a diagnosis, but to indicate the presence of cognitive impairment due \nto delirium, dementia or head injury. It is brief, easily administered, has high inter-rater reliability and may be used to \nmonitor progress or fluctuations in these disorders. \nThe thirty items in the MMSE measure orientation, attention, registration (immediate memory), recall (short-term \nmemory), language and visuo-spatial function \nPerformance in the MMSE is affected by age; years of education; socioeconomic status; ethnicity and whether English \nis the first or second language. Better educated people may score well on the test despite having significant cognitive \nimpairment. \nScores of 25-30 out of 30 are considered normal; 18-24 indicate mild to moderate impairment and scores of 17 or less \nindicate severe impairment. Once patients reach the more advanced stages of disease or dementia, their scores are \nso low that progression cannot be assessed. \nThe MMSE was developed primarily to quantify cognitive functioning in elderly patients with delirium and \ndementia and may not be reliable in every patient in all situations. It may be useless at detecting focal \ncerebral lesions (aphasia, amnesia), right hemisphere disorders and frontal lobe deficits. \nIt is essential to consider the performance profile of the subsets of the test as well as the overall score. Patients with \nAlzheimer disease may perform worst on recall, orientation and drawing, whereas subcortical dementias may primarily \naffect attention and concentration. \nThe MMSE may be supplemented by specifically testing frontal lobe functioning via \n• verbal fluency tests: for example, naming as many words as possible in one minute starting with the letter F, then \nthe letter A, then S. Normal is 15 words per letter or 30 words in total for the three. Once again allowance must be \nmade for age, education, ethnicity and command of English. Alternatively ask for as many examples as possible \nfrom semantic categories: such as animals, fruit or vegetables in one minute (10 or less abnormal); or list as \nmany items as possible that can be bought in a supermarket (15 or less is abnormal); \n• The interpretation of proverbs or sayings: for example, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush', 'a stitch in \ntime saves nine] \n• similarities and differences: e.g. apple and banana, table and chair, child and dwarf, ice and glass: and \n• motor sequencing tests: either rapidly alternating hand movements or the Luria three-step hand movements: \nfist-edge-palm; are all easily incorporated adjuncts to a more comprehensive screen of frontal lobe function. \nPatients with frontal lobe dysfunction score poorly, perseverate and become disorganised under the time pressure \nof these simple tests. \nFrank P Hume \n",

Occasionally you can hear them whispering amongst themselves \nor 'operating a computet system that enables them to track you with electromagnetic radiation '. \nAlthough you live at home with your aging parents, you are socially isolated and rarely go out. You have been taking \nthioridazine under protest for 15 years and your condition is relatively stable. You have only limited insight into your \nillness. You are convinced that a family does live in your roof and you only take medication because your mother \nsupervises this and insists that taking medication daily is a condition of you continuing to live at home. You cannot \nrealistically move out, as you cannot afford to live anywhere else. Your only income is the disability support pension. \nYour weight is 66 kg and your height is 1.5 metres (BMI 29 kg/m2). \nYou are attending your general practitioner to receive a repeat prescription of your thioridazine (Melleril®). It is a \ndrug that has given you a mild dry mouth, blurred vision and constipation for years, so that when the doctor tells you \nit is time for a change, you are relieved, but sceptical — unconvinced that you need medication at all. \nListen carefully to what the doctor says about the new medication options and respond appropriately depending on \nwhat is said. \nEXPECTATIONS OF CANDIDATE PERFORMANCE \nThe candidate should advise the patient of the need for medication change by appropriately: \n• \nOutlining recent evidence linking her current medication with potentially life-threatening arrhythmias. \n• \nDescribing the benefits and side effects of alternative medications. \n• \nObtaining informed consent for medication change. \n• \nOutlining the management plan as detailed in the commentary. \n• \nResponding to patient's queries. \nKEY ISSUES \n• \nExplanation of risks of continuing current medication. \n• \nExplanation of benefits and side effects of recommended alternative medications. \n• \nMonitoring and followup during medication changeover. \n",

      "text": "457 \n083 \nPerformance Guidelines \n \n \nCRITICAL ERROR - none defined \nCOMMENTARY \nIn 2002, Australian prescribers were alerted to the recently established link between thioridazine and prolongation of \nthe QTc interval of the heart. There is a danger of life-threatening ventricular tachycardia if the QTc interval is longer \nthan 500 milliseconds. \nPre-existing cardiac pathology, electrolyte abnormalities, thyroid disease, cerebrovascular disease, severe \nbradycardia and many commonly prescribed drugs may all lengthen the repolarisation phase of the ventricular \nmyocardium, which could trigger the polymorphic tachycardia known as torsade de pointes. \nThis arrhythmia is usually self-terminating but can progress to ventricular fibrillation or sustained tachycardia. \nDizziness, syncopal episodes, cardiac arrest or death may result. Blockade of cardiac potassium channels may be the \nmechanism and genetic factors may play a part. Women are at greater risk. \nThioridazine has also long been known to cause lenticular opacities when used in high dosage for long periods. But it \nis the anticholinergic effects which cause most subjective discomfort. Sedation, postural hypotension and weight gain \nare other well known side effects. Extrapyramidal toxicity with thioridazine is uncommon, but not rare. \nSince 1992 there have been several atypical antipsychotic drugs available for prescription in Australia. They are \n'atypical' in the sense that their mechanism of action is not solely to block CNS dopamine D2 receptors and they are \nthus less likely to cause tardive dyskinaesia or other extrapyramidal syndromes. Their efficacy is equivalent to \nconventional 'typical' antipsychotics. \nThe most important emerging side effects of the atypical agents are weight gain, metabolic disturbances and \nhyperprolactinaemia. Risperidone, olanzapine, amisulpride and quetiapine are available for prescription on the \nPharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for schizophrenia. \nWeight gain liability is not confined to the atypicals, but olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone (of the drugs \navailable for prescription by general practitioners) are associated with faster and greater weight gain than typical \nantipsychotics. Adolescents may be particularly susceptible to this side effect. Weight gain is not dose-dependent, but \npatients who were relatively underweight prior to treatment may put on the most weight. \nThe mechanism of weight gain may be blockage of the histamine H, receptor (which also causes sedation) and \nantagonism at 5HT2A receptors, as well as impaired feedback of the adipose tissue-leptin loop. \nThere is an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia independent of treatment, but \nweight gain and inappropriate dietary choice increase the risk further. Atypical antipsychotics, particularly olanzapine, \nheighten the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes especially in overweight or obese patients, by increasing insulin \nresistance. The risk is less with risperidone and quetiapine. \nTriglyceride levels, but not cholesterol, may also be significantly increased by olanzapine. Data about other atypicals \nare limited. \n",

      "text": "458 \n083 \nPerformance Guidelines \n \n \n \nHyperprolactinaemia is a well known side effect of typical antipsychotics due to removal of inhibition of prolactin \nsecretion by hypothalamic dopamine receptor blockade. Risperidone, of the atypical antipsychotics, has the greatest \nrisk of hyperprolactinaemia and hence amenorrhoea, galactorrhoea. decreased libido, impotence and anorgasmia. \nProlonged uninhibited prolactin release may cause hypogonadism and decreased oestrogen and testosterone \nsecretion, which in turn increases cardiac morbidity and osteoporosis, and gives an increased risk of breast cancer. \nHyperprolactinaemia, however, is a laboratory finding and is not always associated with clinical symptoms. \nClozapine is the atypical antipsychotic with the most adverse side effect profile, including agranulocytosis, but it is \navailable only through specialist clinics. \nAmisulpride is the atypical antipsychotic most likely to cause extrapyramidal side effects, although it is claimed to \npreferentially block limbic dopamine receptors rather than those in the striatum. \nThe decision to change a patient from a typical to an atypical antipsychotic depends on the risk/benefit ratio. A \npatient on typical antipsychotics, who is stable and whose symptoms have reached equilibrium with minimal side \neffects, should not necessarily be changed to an atypical agent just because there is a choice. There is an increased \nrisk of relapse requiring hospitalisation during the changeover period and patients need to be warned of the above \nmajor side effects. \nLifestyle and dietary advice, weight monitoring and an agreed exercise program are all essential elements of the \npreswitch counselling process. Baseline weight, body mass index, blood pressure must be measured as well as a \n12-lead ECG. thyroid function, fasting blood sugar and lipids, prolactin, full blood count, electrolytes, urea, creatinine \nand liver function tests. \nOnce the decision has been made to change a patient from one antipsychotic to a new one, then for a nonacute \npatient, a crossover period of 1-2 weeks is recommended by reducing the dose of the previous medication and \ngradually increasing the dose of the new medication. Patients and caregiver need to be alert to the 'early warning \nsigns' or relapse signature' symptoms which herald the return of acute psychosis. \nNonspecific discontinuation symptoms may persist for several weeks after changeover. These include: nausea, \nheadache, restlessness and an influenza-like syndrome. \nIn this patient, because of the length of time on a typical antipsychotic, any change toa newer atypical agent may \nrequire dose-titration over several weeks and doses towards the higher end of the therapeutic range may be \nnecessary. \n",

It is a competitive environment. You have been \nwith the company for six years since graduation from university, but your career progress has stalled. Although you are \nconscientious and reliable at work, it is three years since your last promotion. Fellow cadets from your intake cohort \nseem to have left you behind. You have just had a performance appraisal interview and have once again been passed \nover for promotion. Your explanation for this is that you are losing scalp hair and must be going bald and that it is your \nhair loss that has cost you your promotion. \nSince your adolescence you have been concerned about your appearance and grooming. It began with a belief that \nyour face was asymmetrical which you believed was obvious to other people and this led to you checking your facial \nfeatures in a mirror several times a day. Then you began to notice facial skin flaws and different shades of \npigmentation. If you developed a pimple or shaving rash you would touch, pick at and constantly inspect the lesion in a \nmirror on an hourly basis. \nChecking your facial appearance on a regular basis during the course of a day has now become part of your daily life. \nEach mirror checking episode lasts several minutes with you having to reassure yourself that no new blemishes have \nappeared or that any existing blemishes are improving or fading. Whilst at work you can only do this every two hours \nfor a few minutes, but at home and on weekends it may take you at least half an hour to complete a thorough \ninspection of your entire head and face region, which you repeat three times a day. If asked, you will concede that the \ntotal amount of time you spend checking your appearance in front of the mirror, touching, examining and picking at \nalmost every skin pore or hair follicle, could be four hours a day on weekends. The amount of time you spend \nmonitoring your appearance is slowly increasing. \nYou still live at home with your parents, who are both school teachers approaching retirement. Your mother suffered \nfrom agoraphobia during her twenties before her marriage. They have become accustomed to you constantly asking \nthem 'Howdo I look?' or, 7s there something wrong with my face/skin/mouth/eyes/hair?' Their unfailing reassurance \nthat there is nothing wrong with your appearance does not reduce your concerns as you are sure they are only saying \nthat to humour you. \nIn the past decade, you have spent a small fortune on male beauty treatments, face packs, facial massages, hair \nstyling and allergy-free soaps, shave creams and cosmetics in an attempt to treat or camouflage your skin defects. It is \nyour main interest. Your concern for the care of your skin means that you do not like to socialise at parties or clubs \nwhere people may smoke. You avoid crowds and public transport to avoid embarrassment of strangers \n",

      "text": "460 \n084 \nPerformance Guidelines \n \n \n \nsubjecting your features to close scrutiny. You avoid direct sun exposure. You do not smoke or \ndrink alcohol. \nOver the past few months you have been monitoring the number of your scalp hairs you have \nfound on the floor of the shower cubicle after a shower. Although it may only be one or two, you \nhave come to believe several things. The first is that the cumulative loss of hairs means that you \nare going bald and that the resultant change in your hair density and thickness is obvious to other \npeople. You are certain that this obvious hair loss has influenced your employers not to promote \nyou because to have employees with thinning hair is not good for the bank's image when dealing \nwith clients. \nFinding out that you have yet again not been promoted has driven you to seek advice, about \ndiagnosis and treatment for your hair loss. As you do not trust your family general practitioner, \nwho has dismissed your concerns and said there is nothing wrong, you have sought a second \nopinion from an unbiased doctor at the city hospital closest to where you work. \nHow to play the role \nYou must be neat, well dressed and have a full head of hair. You will have an envelope with a \ncouple of strands of your hair in it. You will be anxious and somewhat irritable. If there is\n7 a mirror \nin the consulting room, then insist on showing the doctor your 'receding hair line' at an early stage \nof the interview. (It would be useful to have a small mirror as a prop) \nOpening statements \n• \n‘Doctor, you've got to find out why I'm losing my hair!' \n• \n‘I want these hairs of mine examined under a microscope by a specialist! ' \n• \n'Let me show you where I'm going bald'. \n• \n'You've got to do something!' \nYour subsequent behaviour and emotional reactions will be shaped by the way the interview \nunfolds. If the doctor rushes to judgment and dismisses your concerns without tact, empathy or \nappropriate discussion, then your irritability and exasperation may increase. \nIf the doctor realises what your underlying problem is. effectively establishes rapport, and the \nextent of your difficulties and hypochondriacal concerns is realised, then be defensive and \nsceptical, but be prepared to listen and interact appropriately. \nDo not willingly volunteer history of your rituals or checking behaviour until asked. These have \nbeen behaviours you have kept secret for years, but you may be relieved that at last someone is \nable to encourage you to talk about them. \nAfter six minutes, the examiner will interrupt the consultation and ask 'What is your provisional \ndiagnosis? Describe briefly possible management plans to me. ' \n EXPECTATIONS OF CANDIDATE PERFORMANCE  \nThe patient has a form of Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) presenting with the conviction of \nimpending baldness, when objectively and clinically, there is no supporting evidence. \nBDD is a form of hypochondriasis which is part of the anxiety disorder spectrum.

Knowledge about the effectiveness of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants \nand cognitive behavioural therapy in this condition would be desirable. \nKey questions the candidate should ask of the patient would be: \n• 'Apart from your hair, have you ever been very worried about your appearance in any other \nway?' \n• (If yes): 'Can you tell me what your concern was?' \n• 'Did this concern preoccupy you?

Even if a slight physical anomaly is present, the person's concern is \nmarkedly excessive. The preoccupation causes significant distress or impairment in the person s \nsocial, occupational and other important areas of functioning. \nTypical complaints commonly involve imagined or slight flaws of the face or head such as thinning \nhair, acne, wrinkles, scars, vascular markings, paleness or redness of the complexion, swelling, \nfacial asymmetry or disproportion or excessive facial hair. \nOther common preoccupations include the shape, size or some other aspect of the nose, eyes, \neyelids, eyebrows, ears, mouth, lips, teeth, jaw, chin, cheeks or head. Any other body part may be \nthe focus of concern (the genitals, breasts, buttocks, abdomen, arms, hands, feet, legs, hips, \nshoulders, spine, overall body size or body build and musculature). \nThe preoccupation may focus simultaneously on several body parts and although it may be often \nspecific: 'a hooked nose'; it may also be vague: 'a flat chest'; or general: 'I'm just ugly'. \n \nFrom Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 4 - Text Revision \nMost individuals with this disorder experience marked distress over their perceived deformities. \nThey find their preoccupations difficult to control and may make little or no attempt to resist them. \nMany hours of the day may be spent thinking and worrying about their 'defect' and these thoughts \nmay dominate their lives, leading to significant impairments in functioning and avoidance of work, \nsocial and public situations.

The condition is common if it is looked for and \nasked about. \nThe most common associated behaviours are mirror-checking, touching, comparing the defect' with other people's \nbody parts either directly or with pictures in magazines, excessive grooming, camouflaging, constantly seeking \nreassurance and questioning others about their alleged defects or ugliness and then seeking dermatological or \ncosmetic surgical treatments. \nSocial impairment is the norm. They are socially avoidant and will not willingly visit restaurants, shopping centres, \nbeaches or go to parties or functions because of their self-consciousness about their appearance. Insight is usually \npoor or partial and their beliefs may become delusional. It is their self-referential ideas, i.e. that other people are \ntaking special notice of their 'defect' and will talk and gossip and laugh about it, that contribute to their social isolation \nand intensify their suffering to the point of despair, self-harm and sometimes suicide. \nPsychiatric comorbidity is universal. Major depression is the most common (60%) but social anxiety/phobia, \nobsessive compulsive disorder, substance abuse and avoidant personality disorder are highly prevalent. \nThere is a roughly equal sex incidence and similar clinical features. Perhaps women are more likely to focus on their \nskins, lips, and weight, whereas men are more preoccupied with overall physique, their genitals and hair loss or \nexcess. The condition typically begins in adolescence, but may not present or be diagnosed until the thirties. The \ncourse is chronic and relapsing. \nMost patients with BDD seek costly dermatological or cosmetic surgical consultations and treatments, but remain \ndissatisfied with the results. They may then become litigious or violent. Rarely patients perform their own \nprocedures after consulting internet web sites. \nManagement \nThe specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants and clomipramine are often effective. The dosages need \nto be in the higher range and it may take three months to get a response, but 70% of patients report improvement. \nAugmentation with antipsychotics may increase the response rate. Treatment must be continued longterm as \nrelapse is common if treatment is discontinued. \nCognitive behavioural treatments including psychoeducation, cognitive challenge and restructuring, exposure and \nresponse prevention, as well as anxiety management training, can supplement drug treatment and increase \nresponse rates to over 80%. Severe comorbid depression may need hopitalisation and/or lithium carbonate \naugmentation with antidepressants. \nTrying to convince patients with entrenched ideas that their beliefs are irrational or that they look normal is unlikely to \npersuade them to accept psychiatric treatment or referral. With the patient's consent, family involvement in \npsychoeducation and treatment planning and supervision of response prevention strategies and the removal of \nmirrors from the family home may be valuable. \n",

You \nhave been told that cholesterol, blood sugar, and resting ECG are normal, but on two occasions in the last month \nwhen tested by the insurance doctor, the BP reading was high (160/80 mmHg) but eventually settled to normal levels. \nOn those days, you had come from particularly difficult meetings. \nYou have never thought about having serious physical illness, and believe people who complain of stress 'just aren't \nmotivated enough or don't work out their goals properly'.

You \nhave planned to retire at 55. You work 12-15 hour days. Since you were promoted 18 months ago, you have been \ntaking work home on weekends more frequently and there is a lot more pressure. You sometimes feel like escaping, \nbut think of it only being a few more years and anyway you feel happier at work than at home these days. It is just too \nnoisy with three teenage children, and you get irritated with your eldest son who dropped out of university last year, \nand 'just sits around playing music with his mates'. You did not go on the family holiday this year for the same reason, \nblaming work.

The evaluation of all of these elements is important in the individual case, especially \nidentification of concurrent psychiatric illness which requires treatment in its own right, and of interpersonal and \nsociocultural factors which trigger or maintain the behaviour. \nHazardous drinking of excessive quantities of alcohol intermittently is a subtype of alcohol abuse, which is less likely \nto be associated with addictive/withdrawal symptoms than a daily drinking pattern, and more likely to be associated \nwith injury and other social and interpersonal sequelae of impaired judgement and poor impulse control. \nThe recognition of hazardous drinking depends less on an estimation of the quantity consumed than defining a \npattern of drinking, often rapidly, to severe intoxication and consequential risk-taking. The symptom of a 'blackout', a \nbrief period of amnesia without loss of consciousness during a drinking episode, is associated with the rapid \nconsumption/absorption of alcohol and is a useful indicator of this pattern. Incidents of accidental injury to self or \nothers, disinhibition and sexual or aggressive acts, and neglect of self or others are other frequent reasons for \nintervention. Episodic neglect of financial, occupational and social responsibility is common, such as regularly \nmissing work after weekends. \nEffectively intervening in such a problem requires identification of the reason for the adverse consequences, sensitive \nbut frank communication about them and the underlying problem and appropriate offers of assistance, including \neducation, assessment of other psychiatric, medical, social, legal and interpersonal problems, motivation for change \nand ongoing review. \nIn this case, there is a specific need to appropriately address the risk to the patients daughter which must include his \nresponsibility for parental care and protection, and the responsibility of the doctor to monitor and ensure her \nwellbeing. including consideration of referral to child protective services. \nIn addition to counselling this young man about his hazardous drinking, the doctor may have a statutory obligation to \ninform an authority such as the Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs of his daughter's \nsituation. She is potentially at risk of abuse by neglect. Rather than being punitive or restrictive, the Department's \ncaseworkers should be able to advise him about local child-care and parent support services, as well as possible \nchild-minding options. Consider checking whether notification was made at the time of his presentation to the \nEmergency Department. \nMost communities will have single parent support groups and possibly men-only support groups which may be of \ninterest to him. A good general practitioner will either have relevant pamphlets on hand or be able to print the \ninformation off line. \n",

If the candidate has \nnot started to ask for these findings six minutes into the examination, the examiner should advise to proceed \nwith the tasks required, namely advising the patient of the diagnosis and management of both the immediate \nproblem and her depressive illness. \n \nEXAMINER INSTRUCTIONS \nThe examiner will have instructed the patient as follows \nYou are a 30-year-old bank clerk. You suffer from recurrent depression. Your medication has recently been \nchanged (see below). You have come back to the Emergency Department of a nearby general hospital \nbecause of severe nausea, headache and the jitters. \nYour opening statement to the doctor should be: ‘I feel awful doctor — I'm nauseated, I've got a \nheadache and a feeling of the jitters. It all started yesterday'. \nWithout prompting — go on and tell the doctor: 'Three weeks ago my local doctor started me on \nProzac® (fluoxetine) 20 mg daily for a relapse of the depression I get. It didn't seem to be \nhelping much'. \nTwo days ago you felt some back pain and attended the hospital Emergency Department. You saw a doctor \nand mental health nurse and were told it was due to muscle strain'. They were more concerned with your \ndepression and prescribed Zoloft® (sertraline) 100 mg daily. You told them about being on Prozac® which \nyou then stopped taking because you knew that both drugs were antidepressants. \nIn answer to further questions which may be asked: \n• \nYou feel anxious and 'aroused'. You are still sleeping poorly and waking about 4-5am. You think your \nappetite was improving before the nausea started. \n• \nYou have never had suicidal ideas but you remain pessimistic about the future and find it hard to \nconcentrate at work. \n• \nYour back pain has resolved. \n• \nYou have had no other symptoms and your last period was two weeks ago. \nYou are wondering if the medication is the reason you feel so unwell. When the candidate explains that this is \nthe case, you are relieved. You are angry that the hospital doctors did not warn you of this, but on the other \nhand you think there may well have been some confusion over what was said to whom as they all seemed \nvery busy and distracted and you felt a bit sorry for them and wanted not to bother them too much. You are \nprepared to follow the doctor's advice about further treatment, but do not want to have another reaction like \nthis. You could say something like 'Could this happen again?' \nThe candidate is not expected to conduct a physical examination, but will ask for appropriate examination \nfindings from the examiner. \n",

As Prozac® (fluoxetine) has a long half life the candidate \nshould recommend waiting at least another week before reintroducing sertraline, at a lower \ndose, for example, 25-30 mg. A reasonable alternative is to reintroduce fluoxetine, which has \nnot yet had an adequate therapeutic trial in this patient. The candidate should continue to treat \nthe depression and should arrange followup with the Emergency Department or the patient's \ngeneral practitioner the next day, and advise the patient to contact the after-hours service \nimmediately if symptoms worsen. Support will need to be provided for the patient during the \n'washout' period as she is still depressed. \n \nKEY ISSUES \n• Ability to diagnose the serotonin syndrome due to side effects of a Selective Serotonin \nReuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) drug. \n \nCRITICAL ERROR \n• Failure to recognise the need to stop the Zoloft® (sertraline) medication. \n \nCOMMENTARY \nThis scenario is a timely reminder about aspects of psychopharmacology. Side effects are \ncommon with most psychotropics because they may be prescribed too enthusiastically and in \ndosages that are inappropriately high, especially in management of 'depression' which is a \ncomplex multifactorial complaint in our modern society. Not all patients with 'depression' or \ndepressive symptoms need antidepressants, but like antibiotics they are often prescribed reflexly \nby doctors under time pressure as a ’quick fix – it can’t do any harm’ panacea for a patient in \ndistress or in tears. Often it is the doctor's helplessness that is being treated by the prescription \nbecause there is never enough time to establish why this patient is depressed on this occasion. \n",

      "text": "476 \n088 \nPerformance Guidelines \n \n \n \nAnother common error is to start with too high a dose if the patient is 'really, really distressed {more must be better and \nwill work faster'). Antidepressants and antipsychotics take 3 4 weeks to work. If the patient's symptoms improve within \nthat time there may be other factors which explain the improvement, such as reduction in anxiety or insomnia or the \nbenefits of a sensitive interview with the discussion of issues and problems, or relief that the problem has been \nidentified and that something is being done. \nOften it is not symptoms per se that cause patients or relatives to seek treatment. Patients present to doctors when \nthey are worried or anxious about symptoms or behaviours, or someone else is, who influences the patient to attend \nthe consultation. Anxiety intensifies ALL symptoms including 'depression' and is accompanied by typically \nexaggerated and catastrophic cognitions about the conseguences and outcome of whatever is causing their distress. \n‘Is it fatal/terminal? Will I go mad/drop dead etc?' \nAn effective initial consultation with a patient who is 'depressed which attempts a biological-psychological- \nsociocultural approach and allows sufficient time for the patient to be listened to, to be understood and to be taken \nseriously, will in itself relieve a major part of the intensity of the symptoms. This will only enhance the effectiveness of \nwhatever is subseguently recommended or prescribed. \nMany people with 'depression' have mood fluctuations on a cyclical basis which are subthreshold or relatively mild. \nThese people are more likely to present at their peaks or troughs when they are symptomatic in response to a life \nevent or ongoing environmental stress. Their symptoms may be naturally or temporally transient. If these people (as \npatients) are then prescribed psychotropics, including antidepressants, when symptomatic (instead of being managed \nexpectantly), and they improve after a few days, they and their clinician may mistakenly attribute their response to the \nmedication. This may commit them to a future psychological dependence on medication rather than learning to \ntolerate temporary oscillations in mood and biological symptoms by using nonchemical coping strategies. \nSome doctors and patients have become brainwashed by pharmaceutical companies into believing that any degree of \ndistress or suffering reguires a chemical solution that is quick and effective (but freguently expensive and \nunnecessary). When a patient has been started on an antidepressant and is appropriately reviewed a week later and \nreports no improvement, the inexperienced or unaware clinician may recommend doubling the dose and seeing the \npatient a week later. At two weeks, when there is still no major improvement or cure, the dose will be increased or \ndoubled again. By the third week when the patient reports some improvement at last, this is wrongly attributed to the \nincrease in dosage and not the latent response to the initial dose. \nSSRIs are potent drugs even in low dosage. Once the dosage increases then side effects and toxicity will increase \nsignificantly. Most patients take such medications erratically or in fits and starts (i.e. if they are having 'a good day' \nthey will skip a dose: if it's a bad day', then they will double the dose). Some patients are extremely somatically \nfocused and will develop toxicity just by reading the package inserts about product information. \nThis patient feels aggrieved that she has been mismanaged and ill-served by the doctors who have unknowingly \ncontributed to her serotonin syndrome. Patients deserve better and clinicians must ensure that they are aware of both \nthe risks and benefits of the drugs they prescribe. As patients become better informed, they will not tolerate scenarios \nlike this one lightly. Neither will their legal advisers. \n",

      "text": "480 \n089 \nPerformance Guidelines \n \n \n \nThe common feature of somatoform disorders is the presence of one or several symptoms or physical signs that \nsuggest an organic or physical illness but which are not explained by any medical condition, or side effects of any \nmedication or substance, or by another psychiatric disorder (e.g. schizophrenia or panic disorder). The symptoms \nmust cause significant distress, impairment or predicaments in the patients social and occupational functioning. \nThese disorders are common and typically first present in general medical or neurological settings. Presentations \nvary from mild to severe and may be symptom-focused (hypochondriasis) or sign-focused (conversion disorder). \nThis patient has a conversion disorder. Her symptoms are confined to the voluntary central nervous system. The \nacute disruption in her ability to walk was not associated with any known infection, trauma or physical injury and does \nnot conform to any known neurological damage pattern. Psychological factors associated with the drama and turmoil \nof her husband's court appearance are highly relevant. Whilst multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis and idiopathic \nperiodic paralysis could be considered, they are improbable. \nThe psychological pathogenesis of a conversion symptom is that the individuals somatic symptoms represent a \nsymbolic resolution of an unconscious conflict, thus reducing otherwise overwhelming affects (anger/rage, anxiety, \ndepression, psychosis) and hence keeping the conflict out of conscious awareness ('primary gain'), but at a price. \nThe external benefits of the symptom/illness behaviour may include avoidance or exemption from anxiety-provoking \nor threatening life experiences (e.g. a court appearance, an exam, a wedding, a job interview), an escape from \nresponsibility, or financial compensation ('secondary gain'). Unlike malingering or the deliberate feigning or faking of \nsymptoms of illness, which is done consciously and with intent, in conversion disorder the motivation is unconscious \nand unintentional. \nTypically the neurological findings are bizarre and atypical and do not conform to any known neurological disease, \nbut may reflect the individual's beliefs about how neurological disease may present. Recent functional magnetic \nresonance imaging and positron emission tomography studies of lower limb psychogenic paralysis, show activation \nof inhibitory centres in the orbitofrontal and cingulate gyrus areas of the brain with associated nonactivation of the \nprimary motor cortex, when patients were actively trying to move paralysed limbs. Psychogenic paralysis is worse \nwhen patients consciously try to move a paralysed limb and are attending to the task, but improves when their \nattention is distracted. \nPrevious followup studies with conversion disorders suggested that 30% may subsequently develop organic central \nnervous system disease. With more thorough examination and modern sophisticated investigative technologies \nmissed organic disease may occur in less than 10% nowadays. 'La belle indifference has no diagnostic validity and is \nnota criterion for diagnosis, nor is there any association with histrionic (or hysterical) personality traits, or repressed \nsexual conflict in the genesis of most instances of conversion disorder. \nDiagnosis depends on a careful history and linking a significant life event or interpersonal stress temporally to the \nonset of the symptoms. Previous episodes of conversion disorder, alexithymia (lack of psychological mindedness). \nincreasing age, lower social class, a family history of physical illness and hence role models and a fear of \nstigmatisation if psychological disorder is acknowledged, may all predispose to a conversion disorder \n",

At that stage, a firm diagnosis may not have \nbeen reached so that the next step in management may be to proceed with investigations or \nreferral. Some of the illustrative management cases in this book begin with a statement of the \ndiagnosis which is provided to the candidate. Others provide sufficient information for the \ncandidate to formulate diagnostic and management plans. In others the information provided \ndirects the candidate to undertake investigations to facilitate diagnosis, or the patient may be \nreturning for a second consultation with results of investigations now to hand. \nOnce the cause of the clinical presentation has been fully identified and treatment is about to \nbegin, the emphasis is now on the formulation of a management plan by the candidate, which \nmay include patient education and reassurance, advice and counselling, prescribing medication, \nrecommending a procedure, onward referral, arranging hospital admission, preventive care, and \nfollowup. Separation of diagnostic and management phases allows parts of what would be \nregarded as a long case' in normal clinical practice to be completed within the time allowed. \nManagement will often involve others beside the patient: a parent, spouse/partner, carer, other \nfamily members or others, such as employers. The ethical bounds of confidentiality must always \nbe kept in mind. In complex cases, the clinician may be confronted with numerous conditions to \ndeal with some of which may be self-limiting, some insoluble, and others with a low priority. Thus, \none may have to use techniques of 'selective attention' and 'selective neglect' whereby a \nconscious decision is made to focus on some problems, but not on others, putting aside some for \nexploring at a later consultation. \nOBJECTIVES OF THE MANAGEMENT PHASE OF THE CONSULTATION ARE TO: \n• treat appropriately the patient and presenting condition; \n• educate the patient about the condition; \n• involve patients as far as possible in the management of their own conditions and ailments; \n• achieve compliance in therapy; \n• emphasise preventive opportunities; and \n• provide appropriate support and reassurance. \n",

The use of medical abbreviations should be avoided (e.g. AMI). \n• Reassure the patient if the condition is minor, or advise the patient of appropriate serious concerns in a \nnonthreatening and supportive way. \n~ An anxious patient may not absorb detailed information adequately before being given time to consider the \nimplications of an important or serious diagnosis \n• \nEstablish the patient's knowledge, understanding and attitude regarding the condition. ~ Patients are usually \nreticent to admit ignorance of a condition and need encouragement to make inquiries (because of concern about \nwasting the doctor's time). \n• \nEducate the patient about the condition.  \n        ~ Correct any incorrect beliefs. \n~ Supplement existing knowledge to a level appropriate to the needs of the patient and the doctor. \n~ The use of a diagram, model, or the patient's X-rays, ultrasounds or scans, will often facilitate effective \ncommunication. \n• \nAnswer the patient's questions. These may reveal misunderstandings which require further explanation. The \ndoctor should exhibit tolerance to repetition of questions, and be prepared to repeat or complete the provision of \ninformation at a subsequent consultation. \n• \nPropose therapy within an appropriate timeframe. \n~ Immediate, including when no action is required. Hospital admission may be the most important action to be \ntaken.  \n~ Longterm, if the illness is chronic or recurrent.  \n~ Preventive, which may be specific and may require lifestyle change. \n• \nRefer as required to a medical specialist or allied health professional. The standard of written referrals is often \ninadequate. Referrals can be given to the patients to carry or sent separately. Enclosing copies of relevant \ninvestigations and other medical reports is advisable. When considering the degree of urgency of the referral it \nshould be remembered that few patients feel they have minor problems in which long delays are acceptable. \nCandidates in the AMC clinical examination need to recognise that referral to a specialist is not sufficient action, \nunless the candidate indicates why the referral is necessary, and what action the specialist is likely to take. \n• \nSupplement and reinforce the information already given during discussion by providing written instructions, or by \nsupplying leaflets and brochures. \n• \nCounsel the patient or relative as required (see also Section 1-A). \n• \nArrange followup — this may include an offer to see another member of the patients family, with the patient's \nconsent. Patients should leave the consultation with a clear understanding of whether the doctor wishes to review \nthis episode of illness, by what means and when. \n",

Unexpected adverse results should be conveyed by \nfurther interview, rather than by telephone. Overlooking to inform a patient of serious adverse results can have \nmedicolegal complications, even when the patient has been instructed to ring to check for results and failed to do so. \nTHERAPEUTICS \nTherapeutics is the selection and use of pharmaceutical agents in the \ntreatment and prevention of ill health and in the maintenance of an \nindividual's health status. \nAustralians are fortunate to have a Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme \nwhich provides federal government subsidies to patients for prescribed \napproved medicines (outside of public hospitals) by registered medical \npractitioners who hold a preserver's number issued by the federal \nhealth department. Costs to patients are further reduced by \nconcessions to certain income and age groups and ex-service \npersonnel — 'safety net' levels also apply to individual's/family's annual \nexpenditure on prescribed medicines. \nCandidates for the AMC examinations are advised to be familiar with \nthe 'Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits' handbook updated three \ntimes a year by the Australian government and issued free to registered \ndoctors, dentists and pharmacists. It contains a list of all subsidised \npharmaceuticals classified by disease categories, similarities of \nactions, generic and trade names, form, prescription quantities and \ntheir cost to the government. \n \nThe use of pharmaceuticals in \ntherapy usually begins once a \npositive diagnosis has been \nmade. Exceptions are where relief \nof severe pain is necessary \nbefore the diagnosis has been \nestablished or proven (renal \ncolic, biliary colic), when a \ntherapeutic trial using medication \ncan confirm a strongly suspected \ndiagnosis (gout, polymyalgia \nrheumatica), or when medication \nis given before a diagnosis has \nbeen confirmed because early \ntreatment is necessary to avoid \nserious, even life-threatening \nconsequences (temporal arteritis, \nmeningococcal septicaemia). \nSome items require government approval before prescribing because of their high cost or risk of adverse reactions. \nAll these considerations have an effect on what pharmaceutical item is selected by the doctor for the treatment of a \nparticular condition. \nCandidates are also referred to a series of publications entitled 'Therapeutic Guidelines', each covering a different \nbody system. They contain regularly updated advice from dedicated consensus groups on the current therapy for most \ndiseases, and are invaluable aids. \nAustralians also self-medicate with 'over-the-counter' items available from pharmacies and health food or natural \nlifestyle outlets. Knowledge by the doctor of the use of these substances by patients can assist in understanding the \npatient's attitude to sickness and health, awareness of possible drug interactions and the possibility of noncompliance. \n",

      "text": "486 \n3-A \nManagement \nObjectives: \nTherapeutics, \nPrevention, and Public Health \n \n \nPatient perception of the effectiveness of medications (e.g. the use of antibiotics for viral \ninfections), varies markedly. Patients often attribute their recovery to medications rather than to \nspontaneous resolution. Also important in considering drug therapy, is the need to treat more \nthan one condition in the same patient (e.g. a diabetic patient who is hypertensive and has \nhyperlipidaemia). Polypharmacy is common in older age groups where several chronic \nconditions are being treated simultaneously, or when a patient on longterm medication develops \nan acute illness which demands additional medication. Patients may be confused when \nmedications are added, existing regimens are altered or dosages changed. Patients may also \nbe uncertain which of their medications relates to which of their ailments and be mistaken about \nthe timing or frequency regimens of their medication. These shortcomings need to be \nunderstood by the doctor who must instruct the patient carefully. This may include writing the \ninstructions down. The situation is compounded by patients attending multiple doctors. Patients \nwill not necessarily volunteer what medications they are on to a second doctor, even when \nreferred for specialist care. The creation of medication lists on a patient's computer-generated \nmedical record has not replaced personal communication and enquiry about medication from \nthe doctor to the patient. \nPharmacists have limited capacity to detect inappropriate prescribing because patients use \ndifferent pharmacies, and because it is unethical for a pharmacist to ask a patient what \ndiagnosis has been made by the doctor. \nIatrogenic illness has steadily increased because of polypharmacy, drug interactions, and \npatient confusion over medication dosage, together with adverse reactions, allergies and \nidiosyncrasies which may be associated with the use of any medication. \nTAKING A 'DRUG' HISTORY \nDiagnostic consultations often require a 'drug' history, as follows: \n• \n‘Do you take now or in the past any prescription or over-the-counter medicines?' \n• \n'What for, and were they helpful or did you have any side-effects?' \n• \n'Do you have any allergies to medications?' \nIf a history of allergy is given, establish details and severity to determine risk of anaphylaxis, for \nexample to penicillin. \nAlways consider whether reactions, side effects or drug interactions may be contributing to \nsymptoms (for example, asthma, claudication or cardiac failure from Beta receptor blocking \nagents; or cough from ACE inhibitors). Of particular importance are the effects of some \nantibiotics on the efficacy of oral contraception, and drugs which accentuate or decrease \nanticoagulant actions of warfarin. The proprietary publication MI MS, updated six times annually \nand circulated to medical practitioners is a very useful guide to such effects, as are databases \non office personal computers. \nAssessment of knowledge of therapeutics frequently takes place in management consultations \nThe use of pharmaceuticals in therapy usually begins once a positive diagnosis has been made. \nExceptions are where relief of severe pain is necessary before the diagnosis has been \nestablished or proven (renal colic, biliary colic), when a therapeutic trial using medication can \nconfirm a strongly suspected diagnosis (gout, polymyalgia rheumatica), or when medication is \ngiven before a diagnosis has been confirmed because early treatment is necessary to avoid \nserious, even life-threatening consequences (temporal arteritis, meningococcal septicaemia). \n",

      "text": "487 \n3-A \nManagement Objectives: Therapeutics, \nPrevention, and Public Health \n \n \nThe first step is for the doctor to select the correct therapeutic agents and name them by generic or proprietary name \nand then comply with any government restrictions on use decide on dose, form, route and time of administration and \nensure that a sufficient supply (which may include repeats) is ordered. These decisions are either written or processed \nonto personalised numbered prescription forms supplied by the government. These are the instructions which the \npatient takes to a pharmacy to obtain the medicine. As emphasised above it is the doctor's responsibility to be aware of \nsignificant side effects (unwanted symptoms from the drug, potential adverse reactions or drug interactions), and to \nadvise patients or relatives accordingly. It is at the doctor's discretion as to how much of such information should be \ndiscussed with individual patients, but pharmacists are required to offer this information to patients, sometimes in \nprinted form. \nA major objective of the doctor in therapeutics is to achieve patient compliance in the use of medication. The doctor's \nfunction of prescribing medication is a complex process dependent not only on knowledge of available therapies for \nspecific diseases, but also on aspects of patient behaviour. \nOften a wide range of therapeutic agents is applicable to a single condition (e.g. hypertension) where therapeutic \npharmacology is complex. Fifty different generic products (classified into 22 different categories) are listed on the PBS \nfor the treatment of hypertension. Most of these agents have several proprietary names. In the MIMS therapeutic \nclassification index, 21 different system and function groupings are listed, each with numerous (up to 14) \nsubcategories. The pharmaceutical companies employ many strategies for marketing their particular product to \ndoctors. More authoritative and referenced information about new drugs, indications, side effects, adverse reactions \nand interactions is available in 'Australian Prescribe? (also online) circulated free to all doctors in Australia by the \nCommonwealth Government. \nDrug usage and dosage need modification in the following circumstances: \n• Pregnancy — drugs potentially harmful to the fetus, particularly those with teratogenic potential, must be avoided. \n• Children correct dosage is especially important in infants and small children and must be individualised and based \non weight. \n• Elderly patients — drug tolerance is reduced increasing risks of overdosage (e.g. postural hypotension from \nantihypertensives). \n• Impaired organ function — especially liver failure or renal insufficiency. \n• Previous portal-systemic shunting operations. \n• The most commonly prescribed drugs cover a wide range, and include blood lipid-lowering agents, antiangina \nagents, antihypertensives, ACE inhibitors, proton-pump inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), \nbronchodilator aerosols, diuretics, sedatives and anxiolytics, together with antibiotics. \n",

      "text": "488 \n3-A \nManagement \nObjectives: \nTherapeutics, \nPrevention, and Public Health \n \n \nPUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT \nMedical practitioners have a central role in public health and the prevention of disease \nTo be effective in this role, clinicians need to be \n• \nopportunistic in offering preventive care when patients present with other problems or concerns; \n• \nanticipatory in routinely assessing the preventive care needs of their patients; \n• \nproactive in targeting preventive care most intensively to high risk individuals; and \n• \nreaching all of their patients, especially those who are least likely to seek out assistance. \nThis involves looking beyond the individual consultation to the population of patients we serve. For example, to be \neffective in immunisation or screening, clinicians must reach a large proportion of patients in their practice or \ncommunity. \nTo do this effectively can be difficult. Each preventive activity uses up some of the clinicians' available time to spend \nwith their patients, and therefore each activity must be based upon sound research evidence of what is effective. \nClinicians therefore need to understand which preventive activities are recommended as the costs may outweigh the \nbenefits when assessed by carefully designed research studies. \nCandidates can access Guidelines on Preventive Activities from the Royal Australian College of General \nPractitioners website (www.racgp.org.au). These guidelines only include activities of relevance where research has \nshown a demonstrated benefit. \nOne of the challenges for clinicians is to ensure access to preventive care for all their patients. Some groups have \nincreased risk of diseases because of social or other factors. \nThe links between poor health and socioeconomic disadvantage include a relationship between mortality, social \nclass and how connected people are to their communities. The opportunities for health are affected by where people \nlive, their skills, their communities and lifestyles. Poorer health makes disadvantaged groups major users of general \npractice and they are also the lowest users of preventive care services. \nSocial and economic factors influencing health include: level of education; occupational status; employment status; \nincome; place of residence and migration. \nCandidates need also to understand the special public health and preventive issues facing Aboriginal peoples and \nTorres Strait Islanders. The poor health of Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders has many causes including \nsocial and economic factors and the history of colonisation, and is also exacerbated by poor access to preventive \ntreatment and late intervention, with many cases of chronic disease only diagnosed when complications are already \npresent. \nNotification of infectious diseases is an important public health responsibility for all clinicians. Candidates should \nknow which diseases are notifiable to public health authorities and how they are to be reported. Recent Australian \nexperience with SARS and related epidemics have emphasised the importance of knowing how to contact local \npublic health authorities. Candidates should be aware of how to contact relevant public health authorities in the event \nof requiring assistance and advice in issues of public safety. \n \nAlan T Rose, Michael R Kidd and Ronald McCoy \n",

The pain was gripping, severe and constant, with episodes of increased \nseverity each few minutes. The pain extended from the loin to your right testicle. You have been \nwrithing in agony with this pain, and never experienced anything like it before. Fortunately it \ngradually eased and ceased after about 30 minutes. You have come to the Emergency \nDepartment and have seen the doctor. The doctor has listened to your story and taken a full \nphysical examination and you have given him a sample of urine for analysis. \nThe pain has now settled. The doctor will explain to you the diagnosis and proposed \nmanagement. You have not heard about renal/ureteric colic or a stone passing from the kidney \ndown the ureter (the tube between the kidney and bladder), but have heard of kidney stones. \nQuestions to ask unless already covered and appropriate responses from doctor/candidate \n(Answers in parentheses after the question): \n• ‘Do / need to be admitted to hospital?' (Not at this stage) \n• 'Will the pain come back?' (Possibly, if the stone is still in the ureter). \n• 'Why did I get the stone?' — Ask this if the candidate suggests a stone is the cause of the \npain. \n• ‘How will I know if I have passed the stone?' (You will strain your urine). \n• 'What happens if the stone does not pass?' (An instrument may have to be inserted to \nretrieve it). \n• 'When do I see you again?' (Followup in a couple of days for investigation results). \nThe candidate should explain that you have a small stone that is passing down your ureter. It \nmay take one to two days to pass the stone. You will be given strong painkillers for the pain in \ncase it recurs. Most stones pass spontaneously. You are unlikely to have future problems, but \ntests on your urine and blood will be done to check this. \nThe investigations required are likely to include: \n• Culture of the urine to exclude infection. \n• An ultrasound of the kidney may be performed looking for evidence of blockage of the ureter \ncaused by the stone. \n• Imaging by computed tomography (CT) to define the size and site of the stone. \n• Examination of the stone after you have passed it to determine the type of stone present. \n• Other blood tests and specialist referral may be required in followup. \n",

No need for pethidine now as pain has gone. \nIf pain returns, give pethidine or Panadeine forte® or a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug \n(NSAID). \n• Give patient a brief description (draw diagram) of the anatomy of the kidneys, ureters, bladder \nand urethra. \n• Pass all urine into a container and strain (save any stones found for analysis). \n• Imaging by computed tomography (CT) abdomen or plain X-ray, to identify the site of the stone \nand use for subsequent assessment. \n• Check urine for infection. \n• Check serum uric acid, and serum calcium, urea and creatinine. \n• Ultrasound to see if hydronephrosis is present is an acceptable and appropriate test, but \ndefinitive imaging is by helical abdominal CT which will pick up very small stones. \n• Advise high fluid intake. Refer to urologist if stone is not passed in 48 hours or pain recurs and \nworsens. He may need an open operation, endoscopic removal, or ultrasound destruction if not \npassed spontaneously (depends on size and site of stone). \n• Followup to check progress. \n \nKEY ISSUES \n• Diagnosis of renal 'colic', probably due to a stone in right ureter. \n• Explanation of the problem to the patient incorporating rapport with the patient and \ncommunication skills. \n• Providing an appropriate plan of management (including provision for further pain relief). \n• Appropriate choice of investigations. \n \nCRITICAL ERRORS \n• Failure to make a diagnosis of renal (ureteric) colic. \n• Failure to arrange appropriate investigations. \n \nCOMMENTARY \nRenal and ureteric pain ('renal colic') frequently accompanies urinary calculi passing from kidney \nto bladder via the ureter. Although the term, renal 'colic', is hallowed by long usage (as is biliary \n'colic'), in neither instance is the pain usually of true 'colicky' type. Renal 'colic' is often an intense, \nconstant, agonising pain which makes the patient writhe and change position in an attempt to gain \nrelief, and does not wax and wane intermittently in a sine-wave pattern, rising through a \ncrescendo of intensity, and then diminishing over a similar period, with regular intervals of relief \nfrom pain in between episodes of cramping pain. This is the pattern of true 'colic', as seen in \nintestinal colic or uterine colic. Renal pain can vary in intensity but not with such cyclical regularity. \n",

Pain can also radiate to the penis and testes, and to the upper thigh. Associated urinary symptoms \nand the presence of blood in the urine (macroscopic or microscopic) help confirm the diagnosis. \nInvestigations of presumed renal colic due to stone are by diagnostic imaging. Most urinary calculi (80%) are \nradio-opaque so plain abdominal X-ray may be diagnostic (as illustrated), however small stones may be missed \nand differentiation from pelvic phleboliths impossible. The preferred investigation is a helical CT without \nintravenous contrast (as illustrated), which will pick up any small stones and also identify urinary tract obstructions. \nThe majority of stones will pass spontaneously, so that treatment is usually expectant while providing pain relief for \nrecurrence of pain. Indications for intervention are large stones not likely to pass spontaneously, calculi associated \nwith uncontrolled infection, and persistence of pain without progress. \nRadiolucent stones occur with hyperuricaemia and in some types of familial and metabolic calculi.

The great majority of cases are nonorganic, that is they are related to an episode, in many cases associated with \nthe passage of a hard stool, which may make the child wary of passing a bowel motion subsequently. This can last for \na varying length of time. Constipation can be associated with a mucosal tear or anal fissure which distresses the child, \nfurther compounding the problem. If one is able to recognise this pattern early and treat it with faecal softeners allowing \nthe fissure to heal, the episode may be short lived. \nMajor problems may develop, however, if the child remains fearful of going to the toilet because of anticipation of pain \nand this compounds the situation leading to chronic constipation, toilet refusal and in many cases overflow encopresis. \nThis may be more difficult to treat. \nYoung children may also develop a fear of the toilet during toilet training if they are required to perch on a toilet seat \nwithout support and this also may lead to deferral and subsequent constipation. \nIn many children, constipation is secondary to an emotional upset or trauma, whether this is at home, school or \nelsewhere. Careful enquiry is necessary to seek information indicating that this may exist. \nThe aims of management are therefore to: \n• Exclude any possible organic pathology. \n• Explore any precipitating features. \n• Provide adequate explanation of the processes involved for both parent and child with a plan of action to alleviate \nthe problem. \nThe hallmark of care of these children is a thorough and careful history which, in the majority of cases, will clarify the \nprobable aetiology. The history should include a thorough enquiry into the child's environment. While organic \nconditions like Hirschsprung disease may need to be considered, Hirschsprung disease has usually presented by this \nage and usually has a history of constipation from birth, often with a delay in the passage of meconium. However, if \nthere is doubt or suspicion of this condition, a paediatric surgical opinion should be sought to arrange bowel biopsies. \nThe history should include a thorough enquiry into aspects of the child's environment including diet, general health, \ngrowth pattern, the family dynamics, progress at school, relationship with peers, and the like. From this information a \nlikely diagnosis may be evident. \nTreatment is essentially careful reassurance and explanation to parent and child of the nature of the condition, if \norganic pathology is not suspected. This should include a comprehensive explanation about how constipation has \ndeveloped, preferably with illustrative drawings. To achieve success is very time consuming in resistant cases, and the \ndoctor's role is to be supportive of the efforts of the parent and child, riding with them the inevitable ups and downs \ntowards success. \n",

Psoriasis affects 2-4% of the population. It is not infective and waxes and wanes in \nintensity. It can be drug-induced, e.g. lithium, Beta blockers, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine; and it can be \nprecipitated by infections, trauma or emotional stress. The lesions can become secondarily infected. Diet is not a \nfactor. There is no complete cure but in most cases psoriasis can be reasonably controlled with therapy. Treatment \nshould be at an appropriate level for the type, site and severity of the condition. Psoriasis can be associated with a \nspecific type of arthritis, mainly affecting the hands. \nIn mild cases, emollients or a weak topical corticosteroid may suffice, but disfiguring psoriasis may warrant the use of \nantimetabolites or immunosuppressants following the use of more potent topical corticosteroids. Complicated or \ndifficult cases need specialist care and open lines of communication between general practitioner, dermatologist, any \nother medical attendants and the patient. \n• For mild to moderate plaque psoriasis — use topical therapy — dithranol, tars, corticosteroids, keratolytics, and \nemollients. Occlusive dressings increase their effect.  \n~ Dithranol — an antiproliferative agent — is very effective. Salicylic acid can be combined with tars and dithranol.  \n~ Tars — anti-inflammatory but can stain and smell which are disadvantages. Less when in combination (e.g. with       \nallantoin).  \n~ Topical corticosteroids are more potent preparations for thicker lesions, large quantities for widespread rash.  \n~ Keratolytics for lifting and softening thick scale such as sulphur and salicylic acid.  \n~ Emollients for scaling or irritation. Harsh soaps should be avoided.  \n~ Calcipotriol (a vitamin D derivative that regulates growth of keratinocytes). \n• For psoriasis which is widespread, severe, or causing disfigurement or disability, systemic therapy is indicated such \nas methotrexate or acitretin or cyclosporin. Phototherapy is also often used by dermatologists. \n",

Politeness, respect \nand consideration rather than an authoritarian approach should be demonstrated when discussing the threat of \nblindness and obtaining compliance with the use of corticosteroids. \nThe doctor should listen carefully to the patient's queries and provide honest as well as accurate answers. Generating \ntrust and confidence and giving the correct level of reassurance are also expected. \nInitial management plan \nAn erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) should be arranged immediately with request for a \nsame day report (this requires liaison with the patient who should contact the doctor later in the day). \nThe patient should be commenced on oral prednisolone in high dose at first (60-100 mg). A stronger nonopioid \nanalgesic than paracetamol should also be prescribed. \nReferral to a surgeon with a view to temporal artery biopsy should be discussed and urgent referral to an eye specialist \nshould be advised. \n",

      "text": "093 \nPerformance Guidelines \n511 \nPatient Education \nThe aetiology and prognosis of temporal arteritis are obscure. It is a manifestation of giant cell arteritis. \nConfirmation by ESR or CRP (usually markedly elevated) is essential, followed in most cases by biopsy of the \nsuperficial temporal artery for confirmation because of the likely need for medium to longterm corticosteroid therapy. \nCommencement of oral steroid therapy before completing investigations is indicated to reduce the risk of visual \nimpairment, especially in a case of this duration (two weeks). \nThis patient should be seen again within 48 hours by which time significant resolution of symptoms should have \noccurred. Once symptoms are controlled and ESR levels fall, the prednisolone can be reduced to maintenance levels \n(5-10 mg three times daily). \nThe patient should be monitored closely by continuing review of symptoms and serial ESR levels. Resolution may take \nup to 2-3 years. Concomitant use of H2 receptor antagonists should be considered in patients with a history of \ndyspepsia or peptic ulcer. \n \nKEY ISSUES \n• Skill in conveying unpleasant news to patient in an honest and supportive manner with guarded reassurance about \nthe outcome. \n• ESR or CRP must be ordered with urgent early report requested. \n• Must commence prednisolone therapy immediately. \n• Patient counselling and education is required regarding possible biopsy, referral to eye specialist and longterm \nnature of the condition. \n \nCRITICAL ERRORS \n• Failure to request ESR or CRP. \n• Failure to commence prednisolone therapy. \n \nCOMMENTARY \nAlthough this is not a common disorder, the high risk of preventable blindness and response to early treatment makes \nit essential knowledge. A highly probable diagnosis is possible on clinical grounds alone. Involvement of the ophthalmic \nartery or ciliary arteries may occur causing optic atrophy and blindness. Vision is impaired in about 50% of patients at \nsome stage. If blindness occurs it is usually irreversible. \nTemporal arteritis may follow polymyalgia rheumatica in about 20% of cases. The condition is very responsive to \ncorticosteroids which should be prescribed in high doses initially. \nMaintenance steroid therapy in lower dose over 2-3 years may be required, which raises the possibility of \nsteroid-induced complications of osteopenia, hypertension, diabetes and changed facies. \n",

He is very concerned, but if informed and reassured appropriately, will \naccept the diagnosis and management plans. \nEXPECTATIONS OF CANDIDATE PERFORMANCE  \nYou would expect the candidate to: \n• \nAcknowledge the patient's distress about his appearance and to provide support and guarded reassurance, \nparticularly reassurance that the patient has not had a stroke. \n• \nExplain the diagnosis and natural history of the condition. The cause is unknown but is consistent with \ninflammatory compression of the facial nerve in the temporal bone (probably viral). \nExpected course — about 70% of patients completely recover within two months. First signs of recovery appear \nwithin two weeks. About 20-25% take up to six months for full recovery; and 5-10% do not recover by the end of \none year. An older patient age is associated with slower recovery. \n• Advise about immediate management: \n~ Steroids are usually prescribed empirically: prednisolone 40-80 mg daily for three days then taper off and cease \nover the next seven days. Antiviral drugs may also be given because of its presumed viral aetiology. \n~ Wear patch over left eye at night. \n~ May prescribe artificial tears. \n~ Review within a few days for support and monitoring. \n~ Investigations are not essential but CT head would be appropriate for reassurance in view of patient anxiety \nabout a stroke. \n~ Referral to a neurologist should be offered for confirmation of diagnosis and possibly for nerve conduction \nstudies. Referral is also appropriate for confirmation of management, because of possibility of incomplete or \nnonrecovery. \n~ Arrange continuing followup to monitor progress, watch for symptoms of conjunctivitis and corneal injury. \n~ Consider early referral to a physiotherapist as an aid to self-management strategies. There is no evidence that \nexercises or nerve stimulation aid recovery, but they may support patient confidence in recovery. \n",

Patients present with an acute or subacute \nonset over a few hours. Pain around the ear is followed by unilateral facial paralysis of lower motor neurone type, with \ncomplete or partial paralysis of muscles supplied by the facial nerve. The clinical features are consistent with a lesion \ndue to inflammatory oedema and compression of the nerve within the bony canal of the petrous temporal bone. \nClinical features of the lesion, if complete and all muscles equally affected are as follows (see illustrative figures): \n• Facial asymmetry is accompanied by loss of voluntary, emotional and associated movements. \n• The affected side of the face is immobile, the eyebrow drops, the lines on the forehead and nasolabial fold are \nsmoothed out. \n• The palpebral fissure is wider due to the unopposed action of levator palpebrae. \n• Tears fail to enter the lacrimal puncta medially because they are no longer held against the conjunctivae and the \neye weeps. \n• The direct corneal reflex is absent, but the patient appreciates the discomfort from testing and the indirect corneal \nreflex is present (the other eye blinks). Corneal abrasion and ulceration are significant risks. \n• Efforts to close the eyes cause the affected globe to roll up under the upper lid (Bell reflex). \n• The a/a nasi does not flare or dilate with vigorous breathing. \n• The lips stay in contact but cannot be pursed for whistling. When smiling, the angle of the mouth on the affected side \ndoes not move; and in repose 'wry-mouth' can be identified. \n• Hyperacusis in the affected ear can be troublesome when the patient is subjected to local noise. \n• During mastication food accumulates in the cheek and dribbling of saliva can occur from between paralysed lips. \n• The articulations of labial consonants (m, b, p) may be affected. \n",

The motor root is joined at the internal auditory \nmeatus by the 'sensory' root, which carries afferent taste fibres from the tongue and also efferent secretomotor fibres \nto the lacrimal and salivary glands. Somatic sensation to the face is subserved by the 5th cranial nerve, not the 7th. \nWithin the petrous temporal bone the nerve runs laterally to the medial wall of the tympanic cavity before bending \nbackwards abruptly (the genu). The facial nerve then runs downwards in the facial canal on the inner wall of the \ntympanic cavity, giving branches to the tiny stapedius muscle of the inner ear, and giving off the chorda tympani, \nbefore emerging from the stylomastoid foramen at the base of the skull. \nThe geniculate ganglion is the relay station for the secretomotor fibres for tears and the site of the sensory root \nganglion of the taste fibres. From the geniculate ganglion run the secretomotor fibres to the lacrimal gland and \nsubmandibular salivary gland. The autonomic sensory taste fibres are carried from the tongue with the lingual nerve \n(carrying ordinary sensation) via chorda tympani through middle and inner ear, to the sensory facial nerve root. Facial \nnerve lesions below the chorda tympani (e.g. in the parotid gland) will not affect taste. \nThe chorda tympani leaves the nerve a few millimetres above the point of exit from the stylomastoid foramen, and runs \nbetween the layers of the tympanic membrane separating outer and middle ears, and then joins the lingual nerve to \nthe tongue, and supplies the anterior two-thirds of the tongue with taste sensation as illustrated. \nThe motor branches of the facial nerve break into a spray of branches and run through the parotid salivary gland \nbefore emerging from its anterior border to supply the facial muscles via temporal, zygomatic, buccal, mandibular, and \ncervical branches as illustrated. \n",

      "text": "094 \nPerformance Guidelines \n516 \nDifferential Diagnoses — other causes of facial nerve palsy \n• \nPatients with Bell Palsy are frequently concerned that they have had a stroke', or have a cerebral tumour. \n• \nFacial weakness due to 'stroke' is usually upper neurone in type and part of a hemi-paresis on the same side as \nthe facial paralysis. Movements of the upper muscles to forehead and eyes (which are bilaterally innervated from \nthe upper motor neurone) are spared, as may be emotional movements. However, an infarct in the pons may \nproduce a nuclear (lower motor neurone) lesion of the facial nerve. \n• \nIn Bell Palsy the motor lesion is confined to the facial nerve alone and is lower motor neurone in type. \n• \nIf hearing loss or other cranial nerve lesions are associated with facial nerve palsy the diagnosis is more likely to \nbe a cerebellopontine angle tumour (for example, auditory neurofibroma) or a vascular event from vertebrobasilar \ninsufficiency. \n• \nIf vesicles within the external ear or on the palate accompany the 7th nerve palsy the condition is viral herpes \nzoster infection affecting the geniculate ganglion, not Bell Palsy. This is the Ramsay Hunt syndrome, and \noccasionally other cranial nerves are also affected. Such patients are often elderly. Pain may precede the facial \npalsy and the associated herpetic eruption in the ear and sometimes on tongue or palate. Recovery of facial nerve \nfunction is rare. Prompt treatment with aciclovir may improve prognosis and diminish post-herpetic neuralgia. \n• \nIf the nerve is affected within the parotid gland, this is usually due to a parotid malignancy giving partial or total \nlower motor palsy. Benign parotid tumours do not cause facial palsy. \n• \nBasal skull fractures of the petrous bone are another important cause of facial nerve palsy. \n \nCONDITION 094.

(Ask only if referral is advised) \nYou are not overly concerned about your condition because your wife has suffered from occasional urinary tract \ninfections over the years which have always responded well to treatment with antibiotics. She has had no other \ninvestigations other than urine laboratory tests.

Failure to ask for \nthe results of urine testing would indicate inadequate care.     , \n \nEXPECTATIONS OF CANDIDATE PERFORMANCE  \nThe candidate should advise the mother along the following lines: \n• The diagnosis is eclampsia, a condition which occurs late in pregnancy generally in women having their first baby. \nProviding it is well controlled, no longterm harm usually occurs to either mother or baby, although it is potentially \nvery dangerous to both the mother and baby. \n• She will need to be transferred and admitted to hospital immediately, and delivery arranged as soon as her blood \npressure and any further fitting are brought completely under control. \n• There is no point prolonging the pregnancy in view of the gestation of 38 weeks. \n• Prior to transfer to the hospital admission an anticonvulsant such as diazepam should be given intravenously in an \nattempt to prevent further fitting (oral therapy is inappropriate and NOT acceptable). \n• The likely care provided in hospital would be: \n~ an intravenous drip to be inserted and magnesium sulphate commenced in appropriate dosage to try to prevent \nany further fits; \n~ the blood pressure should be lowered with intravenous hydralazine or diazoxide — oral agents are ineffective and \nshould not be used; \n~ tests on patient should include: renal function tests, liver function tests, Hb and platelet count, and coagulation \nprofile; \n      ~ the fetus should be checked by cardiotocography (CTG); \n      ~ monitoring of the patient should include: pulse, blood pressure, temperature, urine output, and frequent urine \ntesting (predominantly for protein); and \n      ~ the room should be prepared in case a further fit occurs with the facility to administer oxygen, to have a Guedel \nairway/padded spoon available to prevent her from biting her tongue, to have the facility to place her in Sims \nposition, and to observe her in a slightly darkened environment. \n",

If the cervix is very favourable, she \nshould be induced and monitored closely in labour, probably with the use of an epidural anaesthetic for pain relief \nand blood pressure control. CTG monitoring of the fetus in labour is mandatory. If the cervix is unfavourable, \nconsideration needs to be given as to whether induction is appropriate, after prostaglandin priming, or whether an \nelective Caesarean section is more appropriate. Obviously if the CTG is abnormal, Caesarean section is likely to \nbe required. \n \nKEY ISSUES \n• Knowledge of the causes of fitting in pregnancy. \n• Ability to manage a patient who has had an eclamptic fit in late pregnancy and is not in hospital. \n \nCRITICAL ERRORS \n• \nFailure to diagnose eclampsia and recognise risk of this to mother and baby. \n• \nFailure to sedate, and failure to transfer her immediately to hospital. \n• \nFailure to outline the three principles of management in the hospital — sedation, lower blood pressure, and \ndelivery of baby. \n \nCOMMENTARY \nIn this case the most likely diagnosis is eclampsia occurring in pregnancy. A history of previous fits should be sought, \nbut it is unlikely that this is anything other than an eclamptic fit. It is important that the three basic principles of the \nmanagement of eclampsia are performed or arranged. These principles are: prevention of further fits; lowering of the \nblood pressure; and arrangement for immediate delivery of the baby by the most appropriate route. \nCommon problems likely with candidate performance are: \n• \nWhen taking the history, not being focused enough to the actual problem, but asking for information such as \nirrelevant past history, social history and so on. This just takes time to do, and reduces the time available for the \nremaining tasks. \n• \nNot asking whether she had had any fits before. \n• \nNot asking for appropriate examination findings, such as hyperreflexia. \n• \nNot requesting whether there was any proteinuria present. \n• \nFailing to understand that any prolongation of the pregnancy is irrelevant as the gestation is already 38 weeks. \n• \nAdministering oral instead of intravenous hypotensive drugs to reduce the blood pressure. \n",

If this is not \npossible, insulin therapy will probably be necessary. \n• Test the blood sugar 3-4 times per day, especially about two hours after a meal. \n• The major risks to the baby are: \n~ Macrosomia (large baby size) — do ultrasound at 32-34 weeks and probably deliver \n      by Caesarean section if macrosomic.  \n ~ Increased risk of fetal death in utero — therefore weekly CTGs should be performed until delivery, twice weekly      \nif on insulin, the fetus is macrosomic or polyhydramnios occurs. These should be started at 32-34 weeks \ngestation. \n ~ Hyaline membrane disease if delivered prematurely — try to delay induction until after 37 weeks. Steroid \ntherapy would improve fetal lung maturity, but will make gestational diabetes worse. \n• Risks to the mother — increased risk of pre-eclampsia. \n• Deliver at term at the latest, unless obstetric complications indicate earlier delivery is indicated. Monitor the fetus \nby continuous CTG in labour. Keep blood glucose levels stable in labour with intermittent insulin injections. \nDeliver by elective Caesarean section if macrosomic (> 90th centile for weight), breech presentation, or evidence \nof fetal distress. \n• The diabetes will almost certainly resolve following delivery. However gestational diabetes is likely in subsequent \npregnancies, and there is a 30% risk of her developing diabetes later in life. Glucose tolerance should therefore \nbe checked at least every 5 years for life. She must control any weight gain in the future. \n \nKEY ISSUES \n• \nAbility to recognise that the blood sugar results are diagnostic of gestational diabetes. \n• \nAbility to appropriately assess the control of the diabetes during the remainder of the pregnancy, and to \nappropriately manage the patient, in consultation with a physician and obstetrician. \n• \nAbility to recognise the need for insulin if the blood glucose levels are not reduced satisfactorily with diet alone. \n• \nAbility to recognise the increased risks to the fetus, and the need for close monitoring. \n",

You were \ninitially exasperated by the wetting but now have accepted that the wetting is involuntary. You have not punished \nJohnny despite your exasperation. \nHis general health is excellent, and he has had no major illnesses. He appears to be growing normally and is on the \nmiddle line of his graph for height and weight. Since the age of 3 years, he has always been dry during the day and \nnever had any incontinence. He has never had a urinary tract infection. \nHe is embarrassed and you and your spouse are very keen to help him control his wetting. His father wet the bed until \nthe age of nine years. The tablets that were tried two years ago made no difference to the wetting. \nJohnny is going very well at school and enjoys his teacher. He has lots of good friends. You and his father are happily \nmarried and have no major stresses in your lives. Johnny has a 4-year-old younger sister who has been dry day and \nnight since the age of two and a half. \nQuestions to ask if not already covered: \n• \n‘Is there something wrong with his kidneys or bladder?' \n• \n'Does he need any investigations?' \n• \n‘We have restricted his fluids after dinner at night and lift him onto the toilet when we go to bed. Should we \ncontinue to do this?' \n• \n'What about when he is asked to sleepover at a friend's place — so far we haven't let him do this.

The boy himself is very keen to be dry, and his parents are keen to \nhelp him achieve this. These are important points the candidate should appreciate.

Most \ncases of primary gout are due to excessive synthesis of uric acid while one-third relate to reduced renal clearance of \nurate. Acute gout commonly affects the great toe metatarsophalangeal joint, although other foot joints and the ankle are \nfrequent sites. It may affect any joint in the body or, unusually, it can present as a polyarticular arthritis mimicking other \nsystemic rheumatic conditions. The joint can be extremely painful, red and tender and the patient may be intolerant of \neven a sheet touching the foot. If fluid can be obtained from an affected joint, it will contain needle-shaped crystals that \nare negatively biréfringent on phase-contrast microscopy.

Hyperuricaemia is commonly exacerbated by excess alcohol \nintake and drugs. It is common in clinical practice to come across an elderly patient who has been on longterm diuretic \ntherapy with chronic tophaceous gout and renal impairment. This should be considered an iatrogenic disease. \nHyperuricaemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Therefore, an attack of gout provides an \nopportunity for the prescriber to review the cardiovascular risk factors (for example, smoking, hyperlipidaemia, \nhypertension, obesity), and to recommend appropriate management. \nIn this station, the candidate is confronted with a very common clinical problem, an eminently treatable condition and an \nopportunity, through patient education, to institute a longterm management plan to reduce the frequency of attacks.

You can expect the \ncandidate to pursue the issue of quantities used. If the candidate approaches this diplomatically, be cooperative in \nuncovering the overuse problem.

The doctor is presented with the problem of being drawn into maintaining a longterm \nbenzodiazepine use habit, with clear evidence of over-use (approximately 75% greater consumption than the \nprescribed dose). Benzodiazepines are recommended for short-term use only. While they have some place in the \nlongterm management of chronic severe anxiety, other treatments, including antidepressant medication and \npsychological treatments (relaxation techniques, cognitive behavioural or interpersonal therapies) must be applied \nfirst. Longterm prescription needs are to be closely supervised and monitored for over-use, such as in this case. \nThis case challenges candidates in a number of ways. Chiefly, it requires them to actively and constructively \nintervene, not just to provide the prescription (with or without advice) or to just refuse the prescription, thus provoking \nthe patient to seek out another source, or risking precipitating a withdrawal state. The satisfactory candidate, in \naddition to managing the immediate consultation needs, will be aware of community support and self-help groups. \nCandidates should demonstrate that they understand the problems of both prescribing further medication without any \nreview or plan for reduction, and also suddenly stopping the medication. Thus, simply advising the patient that they \nwill 'talk next time', or refusing to prescribe with no other measures put in place, are both unsatisfactory. Similarly, \nreferring the patient immediately to a substance abuse unit would be unsatisfactory and counterproductive. \n",

These include at least: \n• establishment of elective or emergency venous access for \ninfusion of fluids; \nThe junior graduate commencing \ninternship is expected to be fully \nconversant and competent with \ncertain core skills, including \nantiseptic and aseptic technique, \nbasic first aid techniques and \nprimary wound care. \nGraduates are expected also to \nunderstand the principles of more \nspecialised clinical skills, and to be \nable to explain these clearly to a \npatient. \n• venesection for collection of blood samples; \n• insertion and removal of a urinary catheter (male and \nfemale); \n• intramuscular, subcutaneous and intradermal injections; \n• cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR); \n• interpretation of ECGs and basic imaging films; \n• use of a glucometer: \n• use of inhaler, spacer and nebuliser; and \n• understanding of spirometry and pulmonary function \ntesting. \nThere are other skills that the individual is expected to acquire progressively under supervision \nduring internship and should have some understanding of at graduation.

It is important that the principles of these procedures are observed and \nunderstood and can be explained to patients. These skills include, among others: \n• indirect laryngoscopy; \n• lumbar puncture; \n• use of a tonometer; and \n• advanced local anaesthetic and field block including intravenous local block (Bier), and \nepidural block commonly used in obstetrics. \nA fourth group of skills include those which are not considered suitable for those at intern level, \nbut which may have been observed by individuals whilst medical students or interns. There is a \ncommon misconception that such procedures need to be learnt at internship, when in reality the \nprocedures should preferably only be undertaken independently by individuals with already \ndeveloped specialist skills. Again, the principles of these procedures should be understood at \nintern level, such that they can be explained to patients. These procedures include: \n• cricothyroidotomy; \n• insertion of a central venous line; \n• insertion of an intercostal draintube; \n• peritoneal dialysis/lavage; and \n• haemodialysis/haemofiltration. \nMissing from these lists are a number of tasks sometimes thought of as procedures, but which \nin reality should be considered an essential part of the examination of the patient. These \ninclude: \n• ophthalmoscopy; \n• measurement of blood pressure; \n• otoscopy; and \n• urinalysis. \nSpecialist and generic endoscopic skills \nThese are usually confined to performance by specialists in various disciplines and include: \n• nasolaryngoscopy, bronchoscopy; \n• upper gastrointestinal endoscopy - - oesophagoscopy, gastroscopy; \n• lower gastrointestinal endoscopy — flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy; and \n• arthroscopy, thoracoscopy, laparoscopy. \nThis section contains some examples of procedures which the intern is expected to be able to \nperform competently and be able to explain to a patient. \nThe following table is an AMC composite checklist of 'Clinical Procedural Skills'. Students are \nexpected by graduation to understand the principles of all of these, and to be able to explain \nthem clearly to a patient. \nCompetence levels expected as regards performance thus varies between those they should \nbe able to perform and interpret independently (A), perform under supervision and with \nguidance (B), or observe and understand principles (C). \n",

The patient should be asked if he feels like \nvoiding. The normal vital signs should be noted; there are no concerning abdominal signs relevant to surgery. The \nbladder is not palpable, gentle suprapubic pressure and absence of desire to void would be checked by \nknowledgeable candidates. Checking that the jugular venous pressure is not elevated and examination of tissue \nturgor for signs of 'dehydration' would be expected (none is present). The JVP is normal and no peripheral oedema \nis present. \nAppropriate treatment would be to increase intravenous fluid intake after acquisition of all data, with presumptive \ndiagnosis of insufficient fluid and electrolyte replacement. \nThe preferred intravenous fluid to order initially would be an isotonic electrolyte solution (saline, Hartmann \nsolution, 4% dextrose in 1/5 isotonic saline), rather than dextrose alone, but a dextrose bolus would be acceptable \nalthough not the preferred fluid. \nImmediate treatment should be intravenous saline 500 mL over 30-60 minutes or so, with review after this. \nThese instructions should be stated and written. \nSome hospitals possess proprietary (ultrasound-based) equipment which the ward staff can use to make \nestimation of bladder volume. This will help determine if the failure to void is due to retention of urine or to \noliguria associated with inadequate fluid replacement. \nCandidates may suggest passing a urethral catheter, which would be acceptable with review of amount obtained \nand subsequent urine output. \nPreferably one would review the patient after giving an initial bolus of fluid. If the patient has not produced any urine \nwithin an hour, a urethral catheter should be passed. Urine obtained would be measured for volume and, if available, \na urinary sodium level should be sought to aid diagnosis. \nComplete anuria would be a highly unlikely finding under these circumstances, and the finding of a low urinary \nsodium level (less than 20 mmol/L) in a small volume of urine would confirm prerenal circulatory insufficiency with \nrenal conservation of sodium and oliguria. In subsequent monitoring of his urinary output, one would aim at an output \nof more than 30 mL hourly. \nAppropriate responses are as outlined. In particular candidates should appreciate that appropriate volume \nreplacement (after checking for signs of volume overload — venous filling, peripheral oedema, auscultate lung \nbases) would preferably be by increased intravenous electrolyte solution replacement (isotonic saline. Hartmann \nsolution, 4% dextrose in 1/5 isotonic saline) rather than dextrose/water alone. Administration of a diuretic prior to \nfluid replacement would indicate a clear fail. \nIf no commentary or plan is forthcoming by six minutes — the examiner will ask: \n• \n‘What is your diagnosis?' \n• \n‘What orders will you give?' \n",

      "text": "102 \nPerformance Guidelines \n554 \n \n \nChanges in Fluid Balance during the Postoperative Period \nThere is increased secretion of many hormones after surgery (catecholamines, Cortisol and adrenocorticotrophic \nhormone (ACTH), aldosterone, antidiuretic hormone (ADH), glucagon, growth hormone) and decreased secretion of \nothers (e.g. insulin). The net result is that both salt and water are retained temporarily by the kidneys. This results in \na transient and minor fall in urine flow for 24-48 hours after major injury and a dilution of electrolytes in serum and \nextracellular fluid. Sodium is also retained, but not to the same degree as water, so sodium is also temporarily diluted. \nThe reality of this is easily checked by looking at virtually any serum electrolyte measurement after an operation, and \nseeing that the levels of ions such as sodium often seem to fall below their normal range, and plasma osmolality is also \nlowered. Remember that this effect is a dilutional effect and does not imply a need for giving more ions — quite the \nopposite in fact, since ions are already being retained by the kidneys. \nAfter the first 24-48 hours, the hormonal effects on the kidneys progressively disappear, and the kidneys can be \nrelied on to make good the electrolyte adjustments required by the body — provided they are given enough fluid and \nelectrolytes with which to work. \nPostoperative Water Balance \nObligatory water losses are around 1500 mL per 24 hours (1000 mL insensible loss from lungs and skin, 500 mL \nminimal obligatory urine volume). Obligatory water losses may increase after surgery because of tachypnoea or \nfever. However, renal losses diminish often to between 700-1000 mL in the first 24 hours. Therefore, 2.5 L per 24 hr \nis usually adequate fluid replacement for adults in the first 24 hours after surgery (not 1,5 litres as is currently ordered \nin this man). \nAs the kidneys begin to excrete more water, the amount of fluid should be increased to approximately 3 L per 24 \nhours. This is the baseline replacement for adults of average spectrum of size and weight. But it must be remembered \nthat any other losses (e.g. nasogastric suction), must be replaced in addition to the 2.5 or 3 L; and this patient has \nalready lost an additional 600 mL of gastric aspirate. \nPostoperative Electrolyte Balance Sodium \nRenal excretion of Na+ diminishes in the first 24 hours after surgery due to increased aldosterone and Cortisol \nsecretion so there may be no need to give Na+ in this period. However, unidentified losses of Na+ can occur with \ninjury or surgery (third space losses); and because of the uncertainty, it is more common to see sodium being given \nthan withheld during this period up to one litre daily, and usually this causes no problems. Nevertheless, it is well to \nremember that this is probably in excess to body requirements and sodium should be withheld or given \nwith caution in elderly patients, or those with failing hearts. This patient has no such problems and we have \nevidence of continuing gastric electrolyte losses of sodium. \nOnce the first 24 hours is past, then sodium requirements return towards normal, and a figure of 150 mmol per day is \nadequate (which conveniently is represented by 1 L of normal saline). \nWith the hormone-driven retention of sodium in the first 24 hours, there tends reciprocally to be increased K+ loss in \nthe urine. However, this loss is small, and not until after this first 24-hour period is it important to replace K+. Note also \nthat potassium given intravenously \n",

After the first 24 hours 2gm of K+ in a litre gives \n26.8 mmol of K; and so if given in 3 L, provides around 80 millimoles K+ a day, which is quite adequate. \nIntravenous Fluids Used in Surgery \na) 5% Dextrose in Water: This is isotonic (isosmolar) with extracellular fluid, and is therefore the solution to use if you \nthink a patient is dehydrated (i.e. deficient in water alone — for example by fever or absence of normal intake) and \nneeds water. Giving 500 mL of 5% Dextrose intravenously over a short period, say an hour, is a useful manoeuvre \nif you think dehydration (i.e. pure water deficit) is the cause of a patient's low urine output. This can be thought of as \ngiving the patient a drink intravenously. This patient needs a drink of salty water, however — he is being \n'de-salinated' by his previous vomiting and peritonitis and by continuing gastric losses. \nb) Normal (isotonic) Saline: This is 0.9% NaCI and in one litre contains approximately 150 mmol of Na+ and 150 \nmmol of CI\"; so at 300 millimolar concentration it is roughly similar in equivalence to extracellular fluid — it might be \nregarded as unsophisticated extracellular fluid replacement. This form of fluid and electrolyte depletion (ECF) is \nby far the one most commonly seen in surgical patients, and gives classical signs (firm woody tongue, decreased \ntissue turgor, sunken eyes). \nc) 4% Dextrose in 1/5 normal Saline: This is an isotonic solution comprising 4/5 dextrose and 1/5 saline; 1/5 isotonic \nSaline (equals 30 millimolar Na) is mixed with 4% Dextrose to increase the tonicity back to that of plasma. Three \nlitres daily of this solution gives 90 mmol sodium which is usually quite adequate for daily requirements. \nd) Solutions such as Ringer-Lactate and Hartmann solution use lactate to increase their tonicity and more closely \nmimic extracellular fluid composition. They also contain some of the other cations and anions of extracellular fluid \n(K, Ca. Mg. CI) in roughly the concentration found in extracellular fluid. Therefore, they can be regarded as \nsophisticated extracellular fluid replacement. However remember that lactate is metabolised in the liver, with the \nrelease of bicarbonate. Thus in acidotic situations it makes good sense to give such solutions; but not if the patient \nis alkalotic. \ne) Potassium-containing fluids: Potassium is the main cation of intracellular fluid. Potassium requirements are \nbroadly similar to sodium. But in contrast to sodium, extracellular and intravascular concentrations of potassium are \nlow (3-5 mmol/L). and high concentrations are cardioplegic and can cause cardiac arrest. So NEVER give \npotassium in a higher concentration than 30-40 mmol/L, and preferably do not exceed 26.8 mmol/L (2 gm KCI in 1 \nlitre). \nf) Haemaccel: This is used in situations where there has been rapid blood loss and when it is important to maintain a \nnormal blood volume while awaiting blood for replacement. It consists of sulphated gelatine (produced from \ncrushed horses' hooves, so it can be allergenic) with an average molecular weight of 30,000 Daltons. It is more or \nless isotonic and the gelatine has a half life of between 30-120 minutes, so its use is very much an interim measure \nto swell blood volume. \nThe patient needs isotonic replacement for suspected insufficient ECF ('Saline') replacement together with \nreplacement of continuing losses (i.e. gastric aspirate), which can be thought of as roughly equivalent to the same \nvolume of isotonic saline. Intravenous hydrochloric acid cannot be given readily, and gastric juice contains a lot of \nsodium as well as hydrogen ion and chloride. \n",

It is never fully achieved, but should be \nsteadily improved and refined throughout the lifetime of the \nclinician. Proper perspective facilitates patient management, \navoids unnecessary delay, allows better cost-effective \ntreatment and achieves better communication with the patient, \nespecially when the prognosis is poor. \nCommon things are common. This must be kept in mind as it \nhelps priority-oriented management. Dysphagia associated \nwith an oesophageal stricture could conceivably follow a \nlightning strike to a sword swallower but is much more likely to \nbe due to one of two common causes — chronic reflux \noesophagitis or a carcinoma of the oesophagus. \nPain in the right iliac fossa always raises the possibility of \nappendicitis. Episodes of spontaneously resolving nonspecific \nabdominal pain with minimal local signs are commonly seen in general practice, but persisting \nacute local pain with tenderness and guarding in the right iliac fossa of the abdomen is most likely \ndue to one of three conditions — appendicitis, a tubal-ovarian problem (ovarian cyst, salpingitis, \nectopic pregnancy), or a urinary tract problem (urinary calculus or infection). These should be \nconsidered first in the diagnosis before other less common causes (of which there are many). A \n22-year-old man with central abdominal pain which shifts to the right iliac fossa, with anorexia \nand local tenderness and rebound tenderness at McBurney point needs an appendicectomy, and \nnot a white count, CT or ultrasound of the abdomen or a battery of other unnecessary tests. This \nbasic maxim regrettably continues regularly to be overlooked in hospital emergency \ndepartments. \nA 22-year-old man with central \nabdominal pain which shifts to \nthe right iliac fossa, with \nanorexia and local tenderness \nand rebound tenderness at \nMcBurney point needs an \nappendicectomy, and not a \nwhite count, CT or ultrasound \nscan of the abdomen or a battery \nof other unnecessary tests. This \nbasic maxim regrettably \ncontinues regularly to be \noverlooked in hospital \nemergency departments. \nPerspective skills improve with accurate knowledge of the underlying anatomy and physiology. A \nforty-year-old woman with abdominal pain and signs of peritonitis in the right upper quadrant of \nthe abdomen is most likely to have acute cholecystitis associated with gall stones. But also keep \nin mind a common condition such as appendicitis occurring in a less common site like the upper \nright quadrant. \nSimply diagnosing that a patient has 'gallstones' is not enough. The site of the gallstones is \ncritical to the patient's condition and a priority in diagnosis. Correct siting determines the correct \ntiming of surgical treatment with the least risk of serious complications. A patient with severe \nacute cholecystitis due to a stone obstructing the cystic duct should undergo cholecystectomy \nwithin five days of the onset of the attack.

Thus, the particular complication caused by the gallstones will prioritise the timing of the surgery. \nNever is there a more important need for clinical perspective than in discussion with a patient who has surgery for a \nmalignant disease. After resection of a colonic carcinoma, the subsequent development of malignant ascites \nassociated with peritoneal metastases is an indication that the patient is unlikely to be helped by further surgery in \nthe form of an open laparotomy. Furthermore, this later occurrence of ascites would have been predicted as a likely \nfuture complication after the first operation when the histopathology had revealed that the carcinoma had spread \nthrough the full thickness of the bowel into the omentum and pericolic tissue. Discussion of the prognosis with the \npatient after the first operation would be guarded and with discretion, based on the spread of the carcinoma identified \nin the histopathology of the resected bowel. Similarly, a patient with carcinoma of the pancreas and back pain due to \nlymphatic or perineural spread of the carcinoma is unlikely to be cured by a pancreatic resection. \nClinical perspective is enhanced by knowing the frequency of a condition in a particular region. In a country where \ntuberculosis is widespread, drug treatment may be appropriately commenced before waiting for the results of \ncultures that may take several weeks. An experienced clinician correlates the frequency of the disease or condition \nin a particular location where the patient lives or has been, with cognisance of the patient's age and sex, and paying \nclose attention to the anatomy and function relevant to the site of the clinical features. In this way, clinical perspective \nand priority management are enhanced. \nCLINICAL REASONING PERSPECTIVES \nOccam's razor often provides useful diagnostic perspectives, applying the principle of diagnostic \nparsimony/unification, thus explaining multiple phenomena by a unifying single cause. \nExample 1 — Melioidosis: \nA 50-year-old surgeon felt quite well after returning from an interstate congress, until performing poorly at his usual \ngame of recreational tennis (he served three double faults in a row, felt cold, and unduly tired despite minimal \nexercise). \nHe lay down for a rest. His wife noted an hour later that he was ashen-faced, clammy and shivering uncontrollably. \nShe summoned an ambulance and he was taken to hospital. His temperature was 40 °C, pulse 130/min, blood \npressure 110/60 mmHg. He looked very ill. The only positive findings were basal lung crackles. X-ray showed \nbronchopneumonia changes. Arterial blood gas analysis showed gross hypoxia and desaturation. Blood cultures \nwere taken and immediate treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics was begun. \nAfter 24 hours his condition had improved somewhat but fever and chest signs persisted. The respiratory physician \nin charge was not satisfied that the diagnosis was of pneumonia alone. Further detailed history showed that the \npatient and some colleagues had gone on a far northern Australia tour immediately after the conference. While \nwading in a lagoon he had abraded his heel drawing a bead of blood. Shortly after the improvement in his chest \nsigns, his heel was noted on re-examination to be slightly swollen and tender, with an inconspicuous area of \nsubcutaneous induration in the adjacent ankle region as illustrated. \n",

He had continuing antibiotic \ntreatment for several weeks with progressive improvement. One month later he had fully recovered. \nMelioidosis is caused by a free-living, small, motile, aerobic Gram-negative saprophytic bacillus (Burkholderia \npseudomallei, formerly called Pseudomonas pseudomallei) found in soil and ponds in tropical environments. Infection \nis through soil contamination of abrasions followed by subcutaneous infections, bacteraemia and lesions in the lung \nand elsewhere. The organism is endemic in northern tropical Australia. Fulminating infection can be rapidly \nprogressive and requires life-saving prompt antibiotic and resuscitative treatment without awaiting confirmation from \nculture or immune antibody tests. Careful clinical assessment in this instance led to linkage between the primary site \nof infection (initially nonsymptomatic and overshadowed by the subsequent prostrating illness), and the associated \npneumonia to identify a single cause. \nExample 2 — Breast cancer: \nA 60-year-old woman presented with persisting back pain.

Two years later she presented with a \nmechanical small bowel obstruction requiring surgical relief. She had no previous history of abdominal surgery. The \npreoperative diagnosis, which was confirmed at surgery, was based on knowledge of the natural history of modes of \nspread of melanoma. She had a metastatic melanotic deposit in the small bowel submucosa causing an intus-\nsusception — a classical although infrequent association. \nExample 5 — Lymphoma: \nA 75-year-old man presented with a slowly growing, painless subcutaneous lump in the left cheek. Examination \nfindings were of a focal firm discrete lump 2.5 cm in diameter, in the substance of the parotid gland. There was no \nfacial nerve involvement and no intraoral extension. No other neck lumps were apparent, nor were there any \nsuspicious skin lesions of scalp or neck. The clinical features were consistent with the diagnosis of a pleomorphic \nadenoma of the parotid, the most common parotid neoplasm, requiring superficial parotidectomy. \nFurther questioning revealed that five years previously he had had a left groin lump removed, which on histology was \na low-grade non-Hodgkin follicular lymphoma. No other manifestations of lymphoma were found at that stage. He \nwas treated expectantly after local excision, and had had no intervening symptoms. \nComputed tomography (CT) of the head and neck confirmed a 2.5 cm focal solid lump of homogeneous texture \nwithin the superficial left parotid, without other abnormality. \nFine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was performed and showed a uniform cellular aspirate of small lymphoid \ncells consistent with a low-grade lymphoma. Flow-cytometryon the aspirate confirmed this as a low-grade B cell \nmonoclonal lymphoma consistent with the previous groin node pathology. \nHe was treated by intravenous infusion of the monoclonal antibody rituximab (Mabthera®) with rapid halving in size \nof the lump. Over the subsequent five years no change in the parotid lump \noccurred; a few nodes in the upper cervical chain became palpable but remitted \nafter two further infusions. \nHe remained well and symptom-free for five years. \nHe then developed acute dysphagia for solids and liquids, and an oesophageal \ncarcinoma was suspected. Oesophagoscopy showed narrowing of the lower \noesophagus with benign histology on endoscopic mucosal biopsy. \nA chest CT and barium swallow showed extrinsic compression of the lower \noesophagus by an enlarged posterior mediastinal lymph node mass, over which \nthe oesophagus was stretched with dilatation of the oesophagus above the \nstricture (Figure 3). After another course of rituximab infusions his symptoms \nrapidly improved and a repeat barium swallow six weeks later showed a normal \noesophagus with resolution of the narrowing and shrinkage of the mediastinal \nnodal mass. \nSECTION 4-A.

Your blood pressure is low. You are lying on a couch and the doctor is taking your history. The list of \nresponses below is likely to cover most of the questions you will be asked. \nList of appropriate answers: \n• You have been trying to conceive since the last miscarriage and have not used contraception. \n• Your last period occurred nine weeks ago; you had hoped you were pregnant. \n• You normally have periods usually every four weeks, lasting five days. \n• Bleeding and pain started 12 hours ago. \n• You have already used more pads than you usually use in a whole period; and have passed a number of clots and \npossibly pieces of tissue. \n• The pain is in the lower abdomen. The pain is coming and going every 5-10 minutes. There is no radiation of pain to \nthe back or elsewhere. \n• There is no dizziness. \n• You do not know your blood group. \nQuestions to ask unless already covered: \n• 'Am I pregnant again?' \n• 'Can anything be done to save my pregnancy?' \n• 'If I'm losing the pregnancy why is this occurring?' \n• 'This would be my second pregnancy lost — why has this occurred?' \n",

No mass or viscus palpable.  \nSpeculum examination:                     Cervix open, products of conception (POC) in cervical os. \n(If the candidate does not ask if the cervix is open or \nclosed, don't give this information but comment on \nuterine size alone). \nPelvic examination: \nThe uterus is enlarged to the size of an eight week \npregnancy, anteverted and mobile. Cervical os is open and easily admits \none finger. Products of contraception are felt in the cervix. No adnexal \nmasses or tenderness. \nInvestigation results (Give these results if the specific test is requested): \nBlood group \nO Rh negative, indirect Coombs test negative. \nHb \n112 g/L. \nIf candidate requests coagulation studies, ultrasound examination or pregnancy test, these are unavailable and \nunnecessary, and should be considered so by the examiner and the candidate marked down accordingly. \n \nEXPECTATIONS OF CANDIDATE PERFORMANCE \nThe candidate should advise the patient along the following lines.  \nThis is an incomplete abortion (miscarriage) \nThe products of conception (POC) need to be removed from the cervix immediately to treat the shock and reduce \nthe bleeding. This should be done in the Emergency Department An intravenous line should be inserted, \nsimultaneously with blood sampling for blood grouping and holding of serum for cross-typing if shock persists after \nremoval of POC. \nGive ergometrine or a similar oxytocic intravenously to reduce blood loss. \nGive anti-D as patient is Rh negative.

This case in particular \ndemonstrates the need to recognise POC trapped in the cervical os and causing 'cervical' shock. The importance of \nremoving the products of conception from the cervical os and administering ergometrine to contract the uterus and \nprevent or reduce further bleeding cannot be stressed too highly. \nCommon problems likely with candidate performance are: \n• When taking the history not being focused enough to the actual problem but asking for information such as \nirrelevant past history, social history and so on.

Adequate diagnosis and resuscitation have first priority in this case \n• Failing to determine that there are POC in the cervical os, and that a diagnosis of incomplete miscarriage is \ntherefore able to be made without the need for further investigation. If the cervix is still closed, ultrasound is required \nto define whether the pregnancy is in the uterus, and whether it is viable. \n• Failing to advise the probable cause of the miscarriage and the likely outcome of future pregnancies. \n",

This sleep disturbance is part of a normal grief reaction and possibly post-traumatic stress \nrelated to a failed resuscitation attempt at the time of his father's death. \n \nEXAMINER INSTRUCTIONS \nThe examiner will have instructed the patient as follows: \nYou are a second year architecture student at the local university. You passed all your subjects last year without any \ndifficulty and did not anticipate having problems this year. You enjoy your studies and do not find them difficult. You \nhave your next set of university exams in three weeks time and have some concerns about these as you did very \nlittle study after your father died, and haven't managed to catch up with your assignments and coursework yet. \nYou haven't advised the Faculty Office, or any of your lecturers about the death of your father one month ago, nor \nexplained the time you were absent from your course (2 weeks), or that you have had difficulty studying (one month). \nYour father died suddenly at home a month ago at the age of 49 years. He had never had an illness in his life, and \nwas sitting watching the TV when he suddenly collapsed. You were studying at the time in your bedroom, but your \nmother called you to help with the resuscitation. Both you and she did this, getting advice over the telephone having \ndialled '000', until the Intensive Care Ambulance arrived. \nAt no stage were you able to get a pulse going. A Coronial postmortem examination was done and showed the major \nartery to the main ventricle of the heart was blocked, and this was the probable cause of death. You have never had \ndifficulty sleeping in the past, except for the night before an examination where you felt your preparation might have \nbeen inadequate and have never taken any drug treatment for this. \nYou have never been seriously unwell in your life, have never used drugs of any sort, but have not played any sport \nsince starting your university studies. You are still living at home because you cannot afford to move into a flat, and \nhaven't had time to take on a regular job except during the long university vacations. You are also an only child and \nyour parents encouraged you to stay at home to save money. \nSince your father's death, your mother has coped reasonably well despite being initially depressed, and expects to \nreceive a pension from your father's previous employer (Australia Post). She thinks this will be enough for you to be \nable to continue with your studies, as the house is fully paid off and her pension will be about $500 per week. On \nspecific enquiry, deny feelings of hopelessness, despair or guilt. You have felt sad but have been able to be cheered \nup by your friends — for example when they insisted on taking you out to a movie recently. \nYou have no suicidal thoughts. After the death you did not eat very well but your appetite has since improved. You \nhave not suffered panic attacks. You are anxious about the impending examinations, as you do not think you are well \nenough prepared for them You have no history of mental illness or psychological problems. \n",

How much time away from \nuniversity studies resulted and whether any special consideration has been applied for must also be determined. \nConcern that the patient has about the possibility of genetic predisposition to early age heart disease should be \ndiscussed, including possible referral to a cardiologist for a full checkup (although it is unlikely anything would be found \nto be wrong as the flying examination was normal six months ago). \nBlood lipid studies would normally be performed.

      "text": "106 \nPerformance Guidelines \n584 \n \nCOMMENTARY  \nGrief is the emotional cost after the loss of someone or something precious and meaningful. Grief is painful and \ncauses psychological anguish, waves of unpleasant dysphoria and distress, physiological arousal and a mixture of \nphysical symptoms. It is a normal function of the human condition, and is not an illness. \nInsomnia in the early days and weeks following a loss is part of the adjustment process and should be managed \nexpectantly in most instances. Individuals can cope and adapt if they realise that grief is part of the natural response \nto an emotional wound, and like a bruise, it will resolve, given time. In some people who cannot afford daytime \nfatigue or somnolence even for a few days after a restless night, then short-term treatment with a hypnotic, either a \nshort-acting benzodiazepine such as temazepam, oxazepam or lorazepam. or a nonbenzodiazepine such as \nZolpidem or zopiclone may be prescribed judiciously for up to two weeks. Rebound insomnia may still occur when \nthe course of the hypnotic is tapered off. Grief-associated insomnia treated with hypnotics may be the start of chronic \nor lifelong psychological dependence on a benzodiazepine and requests for repeat prescriptions should usually be \ndeclined, with the focus switched to sleep hygiene strategies instead. \nGrief reactions such as anorexia and weight loss are common as is poor concentration, fatigue, absent-mindedness, \nauditory and visual or olfactory hallucinations involving the deceased, crying, rocking, wearing the clothing of the \ndeceased, searching behaviours, feeling that life is not worth living, catastrophic cognitions about life in the future \nwithout the deceased ('How will I cope without...?') are also normal and not indicative of depression or indications \nfor psychotropic treatment. \nIt is normal to feel diminished and bereft when someone revered dies, but not to feel personally worthless, useless \nand hopeless with lowered self-esteem and irrational guilt or shame. Suicidal ideation is not part of normal grief, but \ndeliberate self-harm afterwards may be cultural, or an expression of extreme dysphoria and not indicative of an \nintention to die. Marked functional impairment, prolonged anorexia and weight loss, persistent insomnia, significant \npsychomotor retardation, hypomania or manic behaviour or frank psychosis are all indications for antidepressant \ntreatment, mood stabilisers including lithium carbonate, or atypical antipsychotics. Specialist referral may be \nnecessary once grief overlaps with psychiatric illness. \nIt would not be unusual for this young man or his mother to experience some elements of post-traumatic stress \nfollowing their unsuccessful attempt at resuscitation. Anxiety, guilt, helplessness, horror and despair may be \nunderstandable sequelae to the incident, but fortunately he is not experiencing any of those feelings at this stage. \nPerhaps after his examinations are over or on subsequent anniversaries of the death, unpleasant and intrusive \nmemories with nightmares and insomnia may appear, but that is for another scenario. \n",

      "text": "108 \nPerformance Guidelines \n \n \nCOMMENTARY \nThe testicular tumour as photographed has the typical features of a seminoma, which is a \nmalignant tumour. Other malignant testicular tumours include teratomas and mixed tumours. \nSpread of these tumours may occur along lymphatics, which drain to the paraaortic lymph nodes \ninitially (not inguinal). Retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement maybe evident on a computed \ntomogram (CT) of the abdomen. Tumour markers (cx-fetoprotein and /J-hCG estimations) are \nhelpful in both initial diagnosis and subsequent followup after primary treatment, to help \ndiagnose tumour recurrence. \nSurgery is performed through an inguinal incision, excising the testis and the cord to the level of \nthe deep inguinal ring. A scrotal incision (or scrotal needling of the tumour) is contraindicated \nbecause of the potential risk of tumour implantation in the scrotal wall thus involving another \nlymphatic field. Scrotal incisions are satisfactory for benign scrotal conditions such as \nhydroceles or an epididymal cyst. Both the clinical signs and an ultrasound examination of the \nscrotum help clarify whether the lesion is a hydrocele or an epididymal cyst or a malignant \ntesticular tumour. \nAdjuvant radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy after surgery has given a better survival rate for \npatients with seminoma and teratoma, the former having a better prognosis (5 year survival rates \ngreater than 85%). \nFollowup with clinical examination, tumour marker tests and CT is required. This patient needs \nreferral to a radiation oncologist. Further imaging of his abdomen and chest by CT is required to \nstage the tumour fully. He is likely to require treatment by combined chemotherapy and \nabdominal radiation. \n \n588 \n",

Don't try to give all the history at once, but give it in reply to \nquestions from the candidate. You should start by giving the information in the paragraph below. \nAbout ten weeks ago, you gave birth to your second child, Thomas, in the local maternity unit. \nThe pregnancy, labour and delivery were uneventful. It was a planned pregnancy and everyone \nelse is delighted that Thomas seems normal and healthy. You have breastfed him since birth. \nYou have been happily married to Peter, who is 30, for five years and continue to live with his \nparents while you save for a home of your own. Although Peter is loving and supportive, he is \ncommitted to building up his travel agency business and is also doing a part time business \ndegree, which keeps him busy six days a week. \nAs soon as you arrived home from the hospital with Thomas, you began to have niggling doubts \nthat there was something wrong with him. You had so much wanted to have a perfect child, the \nson that your husband and family would be so proud of. Despite the delight and reassurances of \nPeter, your extended families and the community baby health clinic nurses, you have become \npreoccupied with Thomas's health and wellbeing and your adequacy as a mother. \nAdmit to 'possibly' being depressed if asked. Volunteer the following 'I'm really not coping \nwell — I don't know what Is wrong with me — I feel I've lost my confidence — I can’ t make \ndecisions — I'm having difficulty sleeping. It's been going on ever since I got home but much \nworse this past two weeks. I am really anxious the baby may stop breathing, like in SIDS. So I'm \ntrying to wake every hour or so to check.' \nYou have been constantly afraid that Thomas may stop breathing and suffer a sudden infant \ndeath, so you have forced yourself to sleep for only brief periods. You have become increasingly \nworried that Thomas is not feeding properly and is failing to thrive because of your insufficient \nsupply of breast milk. So you have been weighing him at every opportunity, at the clinic, at home \nand weekly at the local hospital Emergency Department. Even though his weight appears to be \nincreasing, you have become convinced that the various weighing scales are wrong and that, as \nhis mother, you KNOW that he is not gaining weight. \n589 \n",

Your appetite has \ndiminished and you have been losing weight since Thomas was born. You have lost 6 kg in the \npast ten days. You are tired all of the time, you feel terrible inside and you feel anxious, agitated, \nunhappy, guilty and desperate. \nYour anxieties about your son's health and wellbeing have not been allayed by reassurances \nfrom your husband, your extended family, the clinic nurses or the hospital Emergency \nDepartment. Now you are worried that your husband's insistence on you coming to see the \ndoctor means that he is planning to divorce you, because you have failed as a mother and a wife \nand brought shame to his family name. \nPSYCHOSOCIAL HISTORY \n• You are the middle of three children with an older brother and younger sister. \n• Parents are alive and well, but live 100 km away. \n• Average student, good at Art. Completed Year 12. \n• Worked in advertising and studied graphic design at college. \n• Met husband through work. Your first and only serious relationship. \n• Married 5 years ago. Happy initially. \n• Describe yourself as a quiet, placid, socially anxious. Very home and family orientated — \nobsessional and conscientious. \n• Nonsmoker. Nondrinker. \n• Both pregnancies planned and relatively uneventful. \n• No postpartum problems with first pregnancy. \n• No past or family history of psychiatric disorder or illness. \nAPPEARANCE/MENTAL STATE \n• No makeup, neat, casually dressed, but rumpled, uncombed hair. \n• Anxious and anguished appearance and manner. \n• Occasionally wringing hands. \n• Softly spoken, limited affective range. \n• Not tearful but sad, gloomy at times. \n• Not thought-disordered. No perceptual abnormalities. \n• Thought form normal, but convinced you are a failure and that your son is suffering because \nof your inadequacies. \n• Admit to ruminating about self-harm if asked, but insist you would NEVER harm your son, \ndaughter, husband or anyone else (you might cut your own wrists or stab yourself). \n590 \n",

This would appear unlikely. \n- \nA macrosomic (large size) baby — unlikely as no evidence of gestational diabetes. \n- \nUterine fibroids, wrong dates — both of these should have been able to be diagnosed \non the 18 week ultrasound examination. \n       ~ Other concerning causes of polyhydramnios which need to be looked for include. \n- \nFetal malformations of the central nervous system, gastrointestinal system, \nabdominal wall, or elsewhere. \n- \nDiabetes — therefore do a glucose tolerance test, even though GCT was normal. \n- \nChorioangioma of the placenta — this should be looked for on ultrasound. \n- \nFetal infection with cytomegalovirus or toxoplasmosis. Both of these can result in \npolyhydramnios. \nPolyhydramnios can cause problems in late pregnancy and labour including malpresentation, \npremature rupture of the membranes, premature labour, and placental abruption following \nmembrane rupture. As she is now at 30 weeks of gestation, she should be advised that she \nwould probably benefit from extra bed rest, but that premature delivery is likely. She should be \ninformed to attend early if she thinks she might be in premature labour. Speculum examination, \nor pelvic examination to assess the cervix, is sometimes appropriate. The candidate should \nindicate that referral back to the specialist is necessary now (or within the next few days). There \nwould be a place for prophylactic steroid therapy to reduce the likelihood of respiratory distress \nin the baby if it is delivered prior to 34 weeks of gestation but the specialist should make this \ndecision. \n594 \n",

If the right side of the colon cannot be visualised, barium \nair-contrast enema should also be done. \n• Initial management plan — the essential process is to exclude carcinoma of the right side of \nthe colon or peptic ulcer which are the most important causes of iron deficiency anaemia in \nthis patient's age group. Other tests such as faecal occult blood or abdominal ultrasound are \nnot required. A therapeutic trial of oral or parenteral iron instead of full investigation is wrong. \nDeferring investigation until the effect of iron therapy is apparent, is also wrong. Blood \ntransfusion is not immediately indicated. Transfusion is unlikely to be needed before surgery if \nthis is found to be necessary. Commencement of oral iron therapy e.g. Ferro-gradumet® \n(ferrous sulphate dried 350 mg sustained release) one daily or similar is acceptable (may need \nto be stopped prior to colonoscopy). Warn about side effects (constipation, colour of stools). \nCommencement of an H2 receptor antagonist, whilst awaiting endoscopy is also acceptable. \n• Patient education and counselling — explain the significance of the iron deficiency \nanaemia and possible causes: \n~ peptic ulcer, reflux oesophagitis; \n~ benign tumour of the stomach or large bowel; \n~ malignant tumour of the stomach or large bowel; \n~ dietary cause is unlikely (the patient is not a vegetarian); \n~ adverse drug reaction e.g. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), aspirin: and  \n~ candidate should know that thalassaemia minor is extremely unlikely with the blood film and    \niron studies obtained. \n \nKEY ISSUES \n• Determine type of anaemia and its cause \n• Interpretation of investigations to confirm presence of iron deficiency anaemia \n• Identification of possible causes of iron deficiency, particularly an occult colonic cancer. \n• Patient education and counselling, explaining problem, answering patient questions and \nadvising further investigation. \n \n597 \n",

In this patient iron deficiency anaemia is strongly suspected by the low mean \ncorpuscular volume (MCV) and the microcytic hypochromic blood film. The low serum ferritin \nand low transferrin saturation confirm the diagnosis of iron deficiency. \nThis station requires the candidate to interpret the clinical picture of symptomatic anaemia in a \nmiddle-aged postmenopausal woman and the full blood examination and blood film presented. \nCirculating iron is bound to transferrin, the iron transport protein.

If any part of the doctor's explanation seems unclear, ask \nfor clarification. \nEXPECTATIONS OF CANDIDATE PERFORMANCE \nThe candidate should diagnose inflammatory bowel disease. \nInflammatory bowel disease includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease (granulomatous colitis). \nBoth can present with diarrhoea. Ulcerative colitis involves the large bowel -mainly ulceration of \nrectal and colonic mucosa (bloody diarrhoea); whereas Crohn disease is a transmural \ninflammation of the whole wall of the small and/or large bowel (usually causing mucous diarrhoea) \nand may lead to intestinal obstruction as well. 'Skip' lesions and fistulae occur in Crohn disease. \nLongterm inflammation is associated with the development of carcinoma of the colon in a small \nproportion of patients with ulcerative colitis, usually those with total colonic involvement. Malignant \nchange is less likely in Crohn disease. \nManagement includes the treatment of nutritional deficiencies and anaemia in severe or chronic \ndiarrhoea. Drug therapy includes the use of sulfasalazine, prednisolone (local enemas or \nsystemic) and immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. azathioprine or mercaptopurine). Surgery is \nindicated for severe, chronic ulcerative colitis or Crohn colitis not responding to medical therapy. \nSurgical treatment for ulcerative colitis necessitates a proctocolectomy with an ileo-anal pouch \nprocedure or ileostomy. Urgent surgery is very occasionally needed if acute toxic dilatation occurs. \n \nKEY ISSUES \n• The candidate should understand the differences between the pathologies of ulcerative colitis \nand Crohn disease, and should demonstrate an understanding of the medical therapies used and \nthe indication for surgery. \n \nCRITICAL ERROR - none defined \n \n599 \n",

      "text": "112 \nPerformance Guidelines \n \nCOMMENTARY  \nThis is becoming an increasingly common scenario. Patients are often provided with \nphotographic evidence of a procedure they have recently undergone and this becomes part of \ntheir travelling record, along with packets of X-rays, letters from medical practitioners and \nlaboratory results. Whilst all this can be of considerable help to the doctor who is reviewing the \npatient, there is an expectation by the patient that the doctor will be able to interpret the data. \nThis may not always be the case, particularly if the patient has returned to see the general \npractitioner before the specialist has had the opportunity to communicate with the referring \ndoctor. \nIn this case, the patient has photographs of a part of the colon and the area of mucosa on view \nshows erythema, oedema and ulceration. The patient has given a history of six months' \nduration, so infection as a cause of this colitis is unlikely but stool cultures and microscopy \nshould not be omitted. Inflammatory bowel disease is a diagnosis which can only be made with \ncertainty once the biopsy results are available. \nWhilst awaiting the letter from the specialist and the histopathology, it would be reasonable to \nexplain to the patient what is meant by the term 'inflammatory bowel disease' and provide a \nbrief overview of Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. At this stage, the general practitioner \nneeds to reassure the patient that in most instances both diseases can be managed quite \nsatisfactorily with medical therapy. The exact medications will depend on which disease is \npresent and the specialist will direct therapy. In most cases the disease will run an indolent \ncourse and be easily kept under control. The patient will be kept under regular review by both \nthe general practitioner and the specialist. Both diseases are lifelong afflictions. \nIf the underlying problem is Crohn disease, the small as well as the large bowel could be \ninvolved. The patient will be treated on a symptomatic basis, but must be aware that \ncomplications can occur. These include flare-up of the colitis (diarrhoea, haemorrhage, \nabdominal pain, and systemic illness), acute colonic dilatation, anorectal fissures, abscess and \nfistulae. If the patient has involvement of the small bowel, intestinal obstruction is another \ncomplication to be considered. Fistulae may form and the patient may present with a \ncomplication related to the fistula (e.g. pneumaturia). \nUlcerative colitis is confined to the mucosa of the large bowel and most patients are well \ncontrolled on medical therapy. Complications may include a flare-up of the colitis, acute \ndilatation of the colon and malignancy. \nAt this stage in the management process it would not be appropriate to bombard the patient \nwith all this information and cause unnecessary concern, particularly with talk about malignancy \nor the place of surgery. At this stage, the patient will be seeking a name to the problem and the \nreassurance that the condition can be treated. \n \n600 \n",

Refractory shock requiring specific management may be cardiogenic, obstructive, septic or \nanaphylactic. \n• NEUROLOGICAL EMERGENCIES — patients who are comatose, stuporous or paralysed need rapid \nassessment and treatment with exclusion of treatable cerebral or spinal compression. \n• OVERWHELMING SEPSIS — specific infections (e.g. meningococcaemia) require early diagnosis and \ntreatment to avoid a fatal outcome. \n• BIRTHING EMERGENCIES — problems are compounded when two lives — mother and babe — are at \nstake. \n• EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TRAUMA (EMST) — management of severe trauma is aided \nby effective triage leading to efficient and rapid protocols of primary (ABCDE: Airway, Breathing, Circulation, \nDisability, Exposure) and secondary surveys where treatment and diagnosis proceed hand in hand. \n• POISONING AND ENVENOMATION — urgent diagnosis and management will be required for circulatory, \nrespiratory, neurologic and haematologic effects. \n \nBryan W Yeo \n                                                                                                            \n601 \n",

If intravenous access cannot be \nobtained rapidly, give intramuscular antibiotic initially. \n \nKEY ISSUES  \n• Recognition of clinical findings indicative of acute life-threatening sepsis in infancy. \n• Recognition of an extremely sick infant requiring immediate diagnostic workup. \n• Recognition that investigation and treatment must proceed together. \n• Recognition that parenteral (preferably intravenous) antibiotics (broad spectrum coverage to cope \nwith all possibilities) will be required. \nCRITICAL ERRORS  \n• Failure to admit the infant to hospital. \n• Failure to undertake urgent investigations. \n• Failure to recommend immediate antibiotic treatment \nCOMMENTARY  \nThis scenario describes a 4-month-old baby girl who presents febrile and obviously very unwell. The \ndiagnosis is most likely to be severe bacterial sepsis with no signs suggesting the causal origin of the \ninfection. This infant requires urgent admission to hospital for investigation and treatment. \nIn this situation a cause of overwhelming sepsis must be sought and this will involve a full work up of \ninvestigations to determine the probable origin and spread of infection. This will include full blood \nexamination including blood culture and inflammatory markers, chest X-ray and examination of urine, \npreferably by suprapubic aspiration, and cerebrospinal fluid via lumbar puncture. \nInfants present in a very nonspecific manner when infected: physical signs that may be present in \nolder children, for example neck stiffness, are absent. The medical attendant therefore must seek out \nmultiple possible infection sources. \nHaving obtained these investigations rapidly, the safest and most appropriate action is then to treat \nthe infant with antibiotic therapy preferably intravenously, providing a broad cover for appropriate \norganisms (e.g. cefotaxime and gentamicin). There is no place in this situation for observation while \nawaiting results as the infant may deteriorate rapidly and irretrievably. Under most circumstances one \nor other of the above investigations will reveal the source of infection. \nYoung infants become ill quickly with bacterial infection and will deteriorate rapidly if not investigated \nand treated urgently. Appropriate treatment often gives rapid improvement. \n611 \n",

The present scenario deviates significantly from the usual pattern, as the child is pale \nand uninterested when handled — the pattern of an unusually and severely ill child Any such child who \nhas a rash, which may in the early stage be very nondescript, should be regarded as having \nsepticaemia until proven otherwise. This will probably be meningococcal. Before introduction of \nroutine infant immunisation against Haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus influenzal infection could \nalso present in this manner. Immunisation with meningococcal vaccine is likely to lessen the \nfrequency of this sort of presentation, but any child who presents like this, even if immunised, should \nbe treated urgently. \nPattern Recognition in this scenario prompts urgent action, which in this case is immediate treatment \nwith intravenous or intramuscular antibiotics. These must not be withheld while the child is \ntransferred, as that could be fatal Third generation cephalosporins are the preferred choice because \nof the possibility of H. influenzae, but penicillin G would be acceptable for initial treatment. \nWhile not appropriate at this stage, the close contacts of this child will require antibiotic prophylaxis \nonce the child's treatment has been arranged. If clinical suspicion of the disease is strong, this should \nbe commenced as soon as possible. \nMeningococcal disease in the early stages can be difficult to recognise and any clue to suggest that it \ncould be present must be followed up. The appearance of a rash in a sick febrile child should alert the \nclinician to this possibility, no matter how atypical the rash may appear. While other organisms, \nespecially viruses, may cause rashes in febrile children, once meningococcaemia is well established \nit may be impossible to contain. \n613 \n",

A careful history determines \nthat the most likely diagnosis is asthma and examination reveals that the child still has significant \nrespiratory distress. \nRecognition of the anxiety created by this very worrying situation for the parent is important and \nreassurance should be given throughout the consultation as to treatment and a subsequent plan \nof action. \nThere are several important issues that must be addressed in this scenario. Firstly, the child \nneeds appropriate acute treatment to relieve her symptoms and this may require hospitalisation \nin the first instance if she does not respond to initial treatment in the practice. \nSecondly, the parent needs to be educated about asthma and the strong associated genetic \nelement, as well as what the common precipitating causes are in children, for example, viral \ninfections. \nThirdly, the parent needs to be counselled on factors that may aggravate the child's asthma, for \nexample, cigarette smoke, and an appropriate plan of action outlined for the parent in the event of \nthe child developing a further asthma attack. The clinician must ensure that the parent is \nconfident in this management and has had appropriate instruction in the use of bronchodilators \nand the equipment, for example, spacers, associated with their use. \nA common omission in practice is adequate instruction for parents in methods of administering \nmedications and the care of equipment. Some practitioners are confident in instructing the \nparents in their use, but if not, the help of an asthma educator should be sought, if available. \nMost parents are able to very adequately cope with their child's asthma if they understand the \npathogenesis and are confident that they know exactly what to do in the acute situation and when \nthey should call for help. It is important to emphasise that even though they have a plan to follow, \nthey should immediately seek help at any time irrespective of the plan if they are concerned \nabout their child's condition. \n",

It \nis acceptable for the candidate to inform the patient of this evaluation — if so it should be \ncommunicated in a nonthreatening way. \nThe candidate is expected to communicate to the patient that he is psychiatrically/ emotionally \nunwell, and that his thoughts/feelings/experiences are so distressing and unpredictable that they \nplace him at risk of further injury, that treatment is required and will help.

      "text": "116 \nPerformance Guidelines \n620 \n \nCOMMENTARY   \nThis is a management task — to implement crisis care for a young man with an acute psychosis \nand injury of unknown origin. \nThe patient presents with a minor injury in the setting of acute psychosis. Such an injury may \nhave been accidental (for example, whilst intoxicated), due to deliberate self-harm, or driven by \npsychotic phenomena (for example, by command hallucinations or delusions). These \nmechanisms carry different degrees of risk and determining the specific mechanism is important \nin the understanding and management of each individual case. In crisis management in a \nprimary care or outpatient setting, however, the fact of injury and potential for further harm is the \noverriding principal determinant requiring further action. \nPresentation with consequential adverse events, such as unexplained self-injury or occupational \nand social problems, is common in acute psychotic illness, as is presentation with requests for \nrelief of somatic or vegetative symptoms such as sleep disturbance. \nIt is important for doctors in all areas, especially those working in primary or emergency care, to \nbe aware of this phenomenon, and to have the capacity to effectively intervene with appropriate \nresponse not only to the presenting problem but also the underlying psychiatric illness, even if not \nfully elucidated. There is a significant risk of serious injury through self-harm if this type of \npresentation is ignored. \nThere is accumulating evidence that early intervention in psychotic illness plays a vital role in \ndiminishing chronicity and severity of outcome in a range of biopsychosocial areas. \nThus, appropriate doctor response entails: \n• Deciding upon the level of risk to the patient and others based on obtained information and \nobservation. \n• Preparedness to act on the decision within the framework of the mental health legislation and \ncrisis psychiatric resources in the region of the doctor's practice. \n• Applying knowledge of psychopharmacology and skill in chemical restraint. In this case, \nundertaking to ensure the patient has sleep relief whilst his condition is further assessed is \nimportant. \n• Using communication skills to manage a difficult-to-engage patient; in this case responding \npositively to the patient's requests for sleep relief and assistance with his academic problems \nis therapeutic, whereas aggressively pursuing the possibility of illicit drug use at this time is \nnot. \n• Applying good judgement with respect to privacy/confidentiality in communicating with \nsignificant others. In this case, seeking consent to inform the parents of the crisis is important, \nbut disclosing speculative information such as possible illicit drug use is not acceptable. \n• Self-harm or unexplained injury in the context of acute psychosis is a serious psychiatric \nemergency. The doctor in this scenario has a duty of care to this young man to ensure that he \nimmediately receives a specialist mental health/psychiatric assessment and that he is \ncontinuously supervised until he has had that assessment. He remains the doctor's \nresponsibility until the assessment occurs. \n",

Some candidates may suggest the use of a \nprostaglandin preparation given per rectum. \n• Start transfusion rapidly with saline, Hartmann solution, or Haemaccel®. \n• Take blood for cross-matching (good candidates would also request blood should be taken for \ncoagulation studies as well). \n• Pass a urethral catheter to ensure the bladder is empty. \n• Observe any blood which is being passed to check whether it is clotting. \nCommentary to examiner should be along the following lines: \nThe cause could be any of the above diagnoses, but the most likely is uterine atony because of \nthe longish labour, the lack of administration of oxytocics and the abdominal findings. Although \nother causes cannot be excluded at this time the initial treatment should be the treatment of \nuterine atony. \n• As soon as I arrive, I will do the following unless the bleeding has substantially decreased.  \n~ Insert an intravenous drip if not completed by midwife — and commence or continue \ncrystalloid fluids or Haemaccel® until blood is available.  \n~ Inspect the placenta myself to ensure it looks complete and normal.  \n~ Do a speculum examination to ensure there is no vaginal or cervical laceration which \nmay require suturing.  \n~ Regularly monitor the vital signs to check the patient's condition.  \n~ Give oxygen by mask.  \n~ Give blood as soon as available and cross-matched.  \nIf the bleeding continues, add Syntocinon® 20-50 units/litre to the intravenous fluids being \nadministered, and notify the obstetric consultant; as it is highly likely an examination under \nanaesthesia (EUA) will be required to ensure there are no retained products of conception \n(RPOC), the uterus is intact and there is no evidence of a partial uterine inversion.

No symptoms of \nenvenomation are present at this stage, but he is concerned and anxious. \nThe patient is lying on a couch wearing shorts. The bite marks are visible and a few drops of \nvenom are on the skin. \nThe candidate is expected to employ first aid by applying a pressure-immobilisation crepe \nbandage to the limb, and to immobilise the limb by appropriate splintage. No specific local wound \ntoilet or treatment is indicated. Knowledgeable candidates will recognise the presence of venom \non the skin and collect some for identification with the Venom Detection Kit which is available in \nmost hospitals. Any suggestion to apply suction or to incise or excise the wound is incorrect and \nwould be marked down accordingly. \nThe appropriate technique is to use a wide crepe bandage from the equipment provided, \napplying it firmly to the whole limb from toes to above knee, applying the bandage with the degree \nof pressure appropriate for a sprained ankle, then applying a splint and attaching the bandaged \nleg to the splint immobilising both the foot and knee. \nThe availability of oxygen therapy and appropriate resuscitative equipment should be checked by \nthe candidate. Use of a venous tourniquet above the bandage is not obligatory but would be \nappropriate. The use of an arterial tourniquet is incorrect and inappropriate. \nAfter the candidate has completed the dressing, the examiner will ask; \n• 'What symptoms and signs of envenomation would you look for in further followup?' \n• 'How would you treat the patient if envenomation is diagnosed or suspected?' \nIndications for antivenom administration are the presence of symptoms and signs of \nenvenomation developing over a period of observation in hospital with facilities for oxygen \nadministration and for ventilatory and circulatory support available. \nInitial symptoms are often headache, nausea and vomiting, which may be accompanied by \ncirculatory collapse, clouding or loss of consciousness, muscle paralysis and coagulation \ndisturbance. \nInitial signs of muscle weakness often include diplopia, local muscle paralysis and breathing \ndifficulty progressing to apnoea due to the effect of neurotoxins. Some venoms have additional \nhaematologic effects causing a coagulopathy with local and systemic bleeding with \nthrombocytopenia.

So in first aid, venom should not be wiped \nor washed from the skin nor should antiseptic be applied until checking for residual venom has \nbeen done at the hospital. Venom present on the skin will NOT be absorbed and is NOT a \ncontinuing risk — envenomation is due to absorption of venom injected subcutaneously by the \nfangs at the time of the bite. \nChoice of antivenom. It is preferable to use a specific antivenom if the snake or its venom can be \npositively identified. If the snake cannot be identified, the normal procedure is to give polyvalent \nantivenom (except in Victoria or Tasmania, where use of combined specific venoms for tiger \nsnake and for brown snake is recommended). Expeditious use of antivenom can be life saving. \nAntivenom is always administered intravenously. Most antivenoms are prepared from horse \nserum. Each ampoule is prepared to contain enough antivenom to neutralise the average output \nfrom a bite of the particular snake, but with severe envenomation multiple ampoules, up to 10 or \nmore, may be required. \nBecause of the risk of allergic reaction to the antivenom, it is recommended that prior to \ncommencing antivenom administration, subcutaneous adrenaline (0.25 mg in adults and 0.01 mg \nper kg in children) should be given; and the infusion of antivenom (diluted 1 in 10 in Hartmann \nsolution) commenced five minutes after adrenaline has been given. \nLoaded syringes with further adrenaline solution (1 mg per mL), antihistamine, and steroid should \nalso be on hand, as should oxygen and full resuscitation facilities. \nAfter observation for reactions to the first dose (which are rare), two or more antivenom ampoules \nshould be infused intravenously. \nPrednisolone (50 mg orally) is also recommended daily for five days if antivenom is used, to \nminimise risk of delayed serum sickness. Steroids are stopped after five days, tapering the dose \nis not required. \nKEY ISSUES \n• Ability to apply an appropriate first aid dressing. \n• Knowledge of features of envenomation and appropriate principles of management of \nenvenomation.

Professional \nskills or 'professionalism' covers a wide range of elements, including communication \nskills, knowledge of medical ethics, personal and professional development, awareness \nof relevant laws pertaining to medical practice and cultural awareness in our multicultural \nsociety. Above all 'professionalism' includes an assumption that a person wishing to \npractise medicine effectively will bring to the task positive attitudes to all the roles \ninvolved in being a doctor. \nThese new approaches to medical education and medical practice have been driven both by the \nprofession and by society. A landmark document which reflected the wish of the profession to be \nresponsive to our changing society was the 'Doherty report'1 which recommended sweeping \nchanges to the medical student curriculum. The Australian community has gradually changed its \nattitude to the traditional emphasis the medical profession had placed on beneficence (which \nwas increasingly seen to represent authoritarianism or paternalism). Through better knowledge \nand understanding of science and medicine and an increasing desire for the information \nnecessary for health care decisions, the community has asserted the rights of patients to the \nethical principle of autonomy. These altered attitudes have also been reflected in decisions \nmade by Australian courts in regard to such matters as the adequacy of information to which \npatients are entitled when giving consent to treatments which carry risks\n2,3.

      "text": "5-A \n630 \nLegal, Ethical and Organisational Aspects: \nEthical and Legal Dilemmas \n \n \none generation, the key ethical pillars for medical practice of beneficence and nonmaleficence \nhave been overshadowed by the principle of patient autonomy bringing the expectation that \ndoctors will show respect for patients, share information willingly and ensure the adequacy of \nconsent to tests, treatment and procedures. \nThese changes have not been easily or readily adapted to by all members of the medical \nprofession. Putting some of them into practice can require considerable wisdom and skill, \nespecially where the balance of those ethical principles may need to be modified to adjust to the \nwishes of older Australians who may still want their doctor to make decisions for them, or to \nadjust to the needs of newly arrived citizens with different expectations. For doctors who \nthemselves are newly arrived in Australia, especially if they have come from countries where \nmore traditional approaches to the authority of the medical profession have been maintained, \nadjustment may also be difficult. Adjusting to a different approach to professionalism will be \ncompounded should the health care system, and the disease and illness patterns, be vastly \ndifferent in Australia from those of the doctor's country of origin. \nThe Australian Medical Council is aware of the challenges which face doctors who obtained their \ninitial training in other countries. The Council has striven to see that education and training are \navailable in the relevant areas of medical professionalism. It has altered its examinations to \nincorporate key elements of these aspects of medical practice. This section provides examples of \nhow this has been done. However, it is very important to note that the separation of this section, \non professional skills and knowledge of law, ethics and the organisation and structure of the \nhealth care system, from the sections on consulting skills, communication skills and clinical skills \nis artificial. To be able to practise medicine in Australia effectively, these professional skills all \nneed to be applied in daily practice. \nThe ethical principle of respect for the autonomy of patients brings the need for doctors to \nexamine the personal and professional values (including religious values) they might bring to a \nconsultation and consciously avoiding imposing their own values in problematic clinical \nsituations. This is not just an issue for doctors new to Australia. Our multicultural society provides \nsimilar challenges for doctors who have trained in Australia. \nThere is no single definition of what the term 'ethics' means in health care. One widely accepted \nview is that it represents the way in which a society determines how it will live after considering \ncarefully all the issues. Thus some people say that ethical decisions are 'all-things-considered' \ndecisions. The dominant ethical principles applying to the practice of medicine in Australia at \npresent reflect a combination of historical influences dating back to the time of Hippocrates as \nwell as the Judeo-Christian thinking which the first Europeans brought with them a little over two \nhundred years ago. The values of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have not yet \nbeen fully recognised by non-indigenous Australians although guidelines developed recently for \nthe purpose of considering health research involving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander \npeoples provide considerable relevant insights into the values and ethical views of these \nAustralians1. Views on ethics may change over time and are context, time and culture specific. A \nsociety's jointly held view on ethical issues will also influence personal values and views of \nethical matters, especially during a person's formative years. \nLaws are specific, ethics are conceptual. For doctors in Australia, several ethical codes of \npractice exist. The most widely known code is that of the Australian Medical Association\n2, \n                                              \n1 Values and Ethics.

      "text": "5-A \nLegal, Ethical and Organisational Aspects: Ethical \nand Legal Dilemmas \n631 \nbut ethical codes also exist tor the various medical colleges. In addition, medical registration \nboards, which are state-based, provide guidance to doctors over a range of professional matters \nincluding standards of practice and legislation relevant to medical practice. Medical boards are \nnot responsible for setting the high standards to which doctors should aspire, but exist to protect \nthe community from doctors whose performance is alleged to have fallen below minimally \nacceptable standards. \nAnother way of expressing the expectations placed upon doctors (especially those who are \nregistered to practise medicine without supervision in Australia) to have sufficient knowledge and \nawareness of the professional skills required, is to list some practical examples of ethical, legal \nand professional dilemmas doctors might face in everyday practice. It must be pointed out that no \npractising doctor in Australia is expected to have immediately available the information to handle \nall of these dilemmas. However, doctors are expected to be able to recognise the issues involved \nand be willing and motivated to turn to relevant sources of advice and help. The following are \nexamples of some common matters relating to ethics, law and the organisation of medicine. \nThese are also issues which frequently result in complaints against doctors being lodged with \nmedical boards and health complaints commissions. \nMedical certificates: Writing a medical certificate is a serious task as the certificate will be used \nby employers, insurance companies and even the courts to determine a person's entitlement to \nfinancial or other benefits. A doctor should never write anything on a certificate to which the \ndoctor could not attest to under oath in a court of law. \nConsent from minors: The definition of a minor is a legal matter, but in medical practice it is \npossible for older children to give consent to treatment and minor procedures. \nIll and impaired doctors: Doctors may become ill and their capacity to practise impaired. In \naddition, doctors are at risk of misuse and dependence on drugs of addiction also leading to \nimpairment. Doctors must be aware of the relevant state or territory laws relating to reporting \npossible impairment or drug misuse. \nSexual misconduct: It is a serious ethical breach, often leading to deregistration. to use one's role \nas a doctor to establish an improper or sexual relationship with a patient. \nNotifiable diseases: There are a range of diseases, mostly infectious, which by law must be \nnotified to health authorities. Much of this responsibility is taken on by pathology laboratories but \nindividual doctors are still ultimately responsible. \nWhen can confidentiality be breached? There are very few situations in which it is legally or \nethically permissible to breach patient confidentiality, and all doctors are expected to have a \nworking understanding of this matter. \nWho is responsible for the professional conduct of your practice staff? In a medical practice, \nultimate medical and legal responsibility rests with the doctor. Thus doctors must take steps to \nensure that staff are trained in matters including those relating to privacy and confidentiality, \nsecurity of records and prescription pads, prompt passing on of messages and the limits to the \nuse of their personal judgement. \nDrugs of addiction: There are important laws that doctors must be familiar with covering the \nsecure storage, prescribing and use of drugs of addiction. \nMedicare fraud: Most general medical practice in Australia is funded by payments to patients \nfrom an Australian Government statutory body, Medicare Australia. Systems are in place to \ndetect irregular patterns of patient and doctor access to benefits paid by Medicare. To avoid \nunintended abuses of this system, doctors must make themselves familiar with the regulations \ninvolved. \n",

Medical student and \npostgraduate training programmes in Australia now place great emphasis on the acquiring of \ngood communication skills. Courses are also offered via the medical colleges and medical \nindemnity organisations. A brief advice document on good communication between doctors and \ntheir patients is available.\n6 \nCollegial support: In Australia, now and in the past, medical students and trainee medical \ngraduates are continuously relating to older more experienced doctors in what is partly an \napprenticeship' system. As a result, there is a highly developed sense that doctors are all part of \na profession that works together to support each member. This support extends to the ready \navailability of free advice from senior colleagues when a doctor becomes aware of an ethical, \nprofessional or legal dilemma. New doctors to Australia should not hesitate to seek advice from \ncolleagues. There is also a strong awareness on behalf of patients of their right to change doctors \nor to seek a second opinion.

The candidate should also provide some explanation as to \nthe basis upon which there is a conflict in that both Ann and Bill are patients of the practice. Both \nare thus patients of the candidate and disclosure and discussions of their individual conditions \ncannot be given to the other without mutual consent, such as by a joint attendance for a medical \nconsultation without coercion. \nThe candidate should be able to identify both the legal and ethical position in terms of accessing \ninformation in circumstances where the husband has serious concerns about the wife's \ncompetency/capacity. \n \nKEY ISSUES \n• Ability to maintain patient confidentiality. \n• Ability to counsel the husband where there is a conflict of interest. \nCRITICAL ERROR \n• Disclosing information about Ann without her consent. \nCOMMENTARY \nWhat is confidentiality? \nThe duty of confidentiality requires that doctors keep confidential all information they are given by \npatients and/or which they discover or learn about patients through their professional \ninteractions. Very occasionally, and clearly not applicable to this instance, confidentiality must be \nbreached by mandated reporting — for example, in cases of child abuse. Patients can normally \nexpect that: \n• all information patients disclose to the doctor will not be passed on to a third party without the \nexpress consent of the patient; and \n• the doctor will take reasonable steps to protect patients' information. \n",

For example, lack of assurance about \nconfidentiality may prevent people from seeking health care (young women with contraceptive \nneeds, people with potentially stigmatising illnesses such as HIV). This can limit medical care, if \ndoctors receive only partial accounts of patients' histories. \n• Confidentiality maintains trust in the doctor-patient relationship. Trust is a foundation value, \nnecessary for full and effective communication, sharing information between patient and \ndoctor and seeking appropriate health care. \n• Maintaining confidentiality maintains community trust in health care, without which the whole \nsystem would be in jeopardy. \n• Confidentiality expresses respect for patients' autonomy. Respecting patient autonomy \nacknowledges that patients have aspects of their lives that they should be able to keep \nconfidential if they choose. \n• Confidentiality is part of the inherent obligation of becoming a medical practitioner. When a \nperson becomes a doctor, the community expects to be promised that patient information will \nremain confidential. \nIn this situation, maintaining Ann's confidentiality requires good communication skills to explain \nto Bill why Ann's medical issues cannot be discussed with him without her consent. This requires \nexplaining the concept of confidentiality in terms that Bill can understand, and being able to \ndefuse matters and respond appropriately if Bill becomes angry. \n",

      "text": "120 \nPerformance Guidelines \n644 \n \nCondition 120 \nObtaining consent for leg amputation in a 30-year-old man after a motor \nvehicle injury \nEXAMINER INSTRUCTIONS \nThe examiner will have instructed the patient as follows: \nYou are a 30-year-old labourer, Brian, who has been fit and well. You are training for selection in \nthe state rowing team. You have just been involved in a motor vehicle accident and have a major \ncrush injury to your left leg. Surgery has been recommended and the candidate has been asked \nto obtain your consent for surgery. The registrar has told the candidate that your leg may have to \nbe amputated. You have been given pain relief and are not experiencing pain at the moment. You \ncan't feel the leg at the moment. The candidate will not be examining you at all. You are lying on \na hospital couch with your leg covered by a sheet and dressing. \nOpening statement \n'What's going to happen?' \nWhen the candidate says that surgery has been recommended, ask  \n‘Is that really necessary?' \nWhen the candidate explains the seriousness of the injury and the possibility of amputation, ask \nfor clarification of any terms you don't understand (including 'amputation') and then say \n'You can't do that!'Be emphatic that you don't want to lose your leg. Say 'It doesn't hurt \nthat much — it can't be that bad'. \nAsk; I'm not going to let you cut off my leg, so what are you going to do?' \n \nEXPECTATIONS OF CANDIDATE PERFORMANCE \nThe candidate should: \n• Give adequate information in broad terms about the injury and about the required surgery, the \npreparation for surgery and the likely outcomes, including what is likely to happen if Brian \nrefuses amputation at this time. This must include any risks which wouldn't be obvious to the \npatient. The doctor's explanation should cover the following points: \n~ All possible means will be considered during the surgery to try to save the leg.  \n~ The main indications for amputation are irreparable damage to the limb and its \ntissues from crushing, tearing or other injuries, and this is the concern with Brian's leg \n— that the local damage may be too great to salvage. \n~ Broken bones, or severed blood vessels or nerves or tendons, can be sewn together \nand repaired and this will be done if possible in a bid to save the limb. Even if a leg has \nbeen wholly amputated in the accident, it can sometimes be replaced by skilled teams \nsuch as this hospital has, members of which will be involved in Brian's surgical care — but \nthis is only possible if the amputated tissues can be restored to useful life and function by \nrestoring full blood flow. If the tissues are already crushed and dead they cannot be \nbrought back to life, and this is the concern with Brian's leg. \n",

There are many other examples among prominent sportsmen and women, such as \nthe Young Australian of the Year amputee who became an outstanding para-olympian \nmedallist,  \n~ If irretrievably dead and dying tissue is not removed by amputation, the end result is not just \na useless lower limb. There are very serious risks to your health and life.  \n- \nThe dead tissues can release toxins and other waste products into the circulation \nwhich can seriously affect the heart and cause sudden cardiac arrest.  \n- \nThe dead tissues will inevitably become infected, which can be overwhelming and \nspread from dead tissue through the blood and to other body systems, called 'gas \ngangrene', which is a major cause of death in these injuries unless dead tissue is \npromptly removed. \n~ If he still cannot face up to the fact that amputation may be required, and will not consent to \nthis possibility, the surgeon will respect his wishes, but this would be Brian's decision, \nalthough made against the recommendations of his treating medical and surgical team.

      "text": "120 \nPerformance Guidelines \n646 \n \n \nCOMMENTARY  \n \nEthical foundations of consent: \nInformed consent is a mechanism for people to control what happens to them, forming an \nimportant part of the ethical obligation of respect for patient autonomy. The main aim of informed \nconsent is to ensure that people are acting freely, without coercion or deception. Informed \nconsent is the process through which people can authorise what happens to them or who \ntouches them, making medical treatments morally acceptable. The law strongly upholds this \nmoral position: before you can examine, treat or care for a competent adult person, you must \nobtain a legally valid consent. Without consent, touching a patient, taking blood, or doing an \noperation is potential battery, even if the action is intended to help rather than harm the patient. \nThe conditions for a valid consent try to ensure that any decision the patient has made is \nautonomous by posing three questions: \n \n• \n‘Is this person competent to make the decision?' \n• \n'Does the person understand the necessary information?' \n• \n‘Is the person making the decision freely? ' \n \nCompetence has to do with the ability of a person to make decisions that reflect their values and \ntheir concern for their own well being. Competence is determined by a person's age and \nintellectual or mental capacity to make a legally binding decision. When assessing competence it \nis important to make sure that the person understands the nature, purpose and effects of the \nproposed treatment. In this case, use of jargon, presence of narcotic analgesia and shock may all \npotentially affect Brian's competence. A second part of competence relates to the patient's ability \nto comprehend and retain relevant information. Assessing this would require the doctor to ask \nBrian to explain back to the doctor what the likely consequences are if Brian does or does not \nagree to amputation. A final part of competence is assessing whether the patient believes the \ninformation and has weighed it in the balance with other considerations when making the final \nchoice. Again, this requires careful discussion with Brian, and a serious attempt on the part of the \ndoctor to understand why Brian is refusing treatment. Allowing Brian to see the degree of \ndamage suffered by the limb may help his understanding; but ultimately if Brian remains \nadamant, then the surgeon would proceed to wound debridement as necessary, short of \namputation, and monitor progress carefully in the postoperative period. \nThe issue of understanding in relation to obtaining a legally valid consent is where patients \nrequire information about the consequences of the proposed treatment, and any alternative \ncourses of action. \nThe legal standard in relation to information to be communicated to patients is determined by the \nrelevant case law and legislation in each of the states and territories. \nFrom a legal point of view, a doctor who does not give the patient enough information is \npotentially liable in actions in negligence or trespass to the person. \nMaking decisions free of coercion requires the doctor to explain the alternatives and their \nconsequences in plain English, tailoring further responses to any questions that the patient may \nask, and avoiding potentially threatening behaviours such as implying that the patient is making a \nstupid decision or that the patient 'deserves' any adverse consequences from not following \nmedical advice. \n",

The second part of \nthe scenario involves how the candidate copes with this difficult clinical situation, and whether the \ncandidate is aware of the doctor's responsibilities under common law. \nEXAMINER INSTRUCTIONS \nThe examiner will have instructed the parent as follows: \nYou are a 30-year-old woman whose first child, Gregory is 9 weeks old. Your husband is a junior \npartner in a large city law firm and works long hours. Your pregnancy was uncomfortable with the \ndelivery needing forceps. Gregory has never fed well and establishing lactation has been difficult. \nYou have moved away from family and friends because of your husband's position, and have left \nyour own successful job because of this.

It affects all socioeconomic groups and may range from relatively minor injuries, through to \nmajor trauma and even death or severe neurological damage. \nThe medical attendant must be alert to the possibility of NAI in any presentation where the \nexplanation for the injury does not tally with the injury sustained or where there are unexpected or \nunexplained minor injuries (e.g. bruises). A thorough and careful history must be taken and \naccurately recorded. \nWith possible physical (and sexual) child abuse, the law in all Australian states requires the \nmedical practitioner to report the suspected abuse to the relevant government department who \nwill investigate the situation and arrange appropriate followup. In large teaching hospitals a \nspecific Child Abuse team may be involved. The child must be placed in a place of safety. In the \ncase of infants with fractures, this usually means hospital, while help is being arranged for the \nfamily. Often further investigations may be required to determine the extent of injuries and may \ninclude skeletal survey and blood investigations. This commonly reveals that abuse has been \noccurring over a period of weeks or even months. \nThe medical practitioner's role also involves continuing support for the family while the process of \ninvestigation is proceeding and after discharge from the place of safety. This situation may often \nbe difficult and may be associated with considerable anger, frustration, accusation and distress, \nall of which need to be addressed. \n",

Evelyn has a significant \nintellectual disability an ataxic gait and suffers from epilepsy. In addition, Evelyn has \nprogressively demonstrated significant behavioural problems that have included episodes of \nuncontrollable violent outbursts. \nSince the death of your husband 12 years ago you have been the sole carer of Evelyn. You have \nno family support and while you have a number of friends they are not able to assist you to any \nsignificant extent with Evelyn's care. \nWhile Evelyn is able to feed and dress herself she is not capable of washing herself, being left \nalone, or independently caring for herself. \nYou are increasingly concerned that Evelyn's behavioural problems are becoming more frequent \nand of greater intensity. You have formed the view that these episodes will be exacerbated with \nthe onset of menstruation. \nIndeed you have serious concerns that Evelyn is neither intellectually capable of understanding \nthe physiological changes that will occur to her body nor physically capable of undertaking her \nhygiene needs. You have, on a number of occasions attempted to talk with Evelyn about \nmenstruation and sexuality but she did not understand what you were attempting to discuss with \nher. \nYou have made the decision that Evelyn requires an operative procedure that will result in her not \ncommencing menstruation. You have discussed the issue with a family friend and decided that \nEvelyn should undergo a hysterectomy and oophorectomy. \nYou believe that the ovaries need to be removed to prevent her having premenstrual tension \nsymptoms. Today you have made an appointment with the general practitioner to organise the \nadmission of Evelyn into a hospital so that she can have the procedure performed. \nStart the interview by saying: \n'Doctor, as you know Evelyn is reaching the age where she will commence \nmenstruation. She won't be able to look after herself and I really think that the change \nin her hormones will make it too difficult for me to care for her. I am already finding \nher care difficult. I have attempted to talk to her about her periods and about \npregnancy but she doesn't have a clue what I am saying to her. I have spoken with \na friend and I think the best thing to do is to have her sterilised.

Why can't she just be sterilised and then I can manage her as I have been \ndoing all these years.

As a general proposition the \nparents of a child have the legal authority to consent to treatment on behalf of their minor children \nprovided they do so in 'the best interests' of the child (Family Law Act [Commonwealth]). \nHowever there are limitations to this authority. In the Australian case of Re Marion the parents of \na 14-year-old intellectually disabled child applied to the Family Law Court for an order permitting \na hysterectomy and oophorectomy to be carried out on their child or a declaration that they could \nlawfully consent to the surgical procedure. The issue before the court was whether the parents of \nthe child had the legal authority to consent to their child's sterilisation? The majority decision of \nthe High Court of Australia determined that the procedure required the authority of the court, \nexpressly stating that the performance of a sterilisation procedure was a 'special case' that took \nthe decision outside what would be considered as the ordinary scope of a parent's authority to \nconsent. \nThe ethical considerations include recognition of the principle of autonomy and the fact that in \ncircumstances where patient capacity is compromised, patients may not be able to participate in \ndecisions about their health care as autonomous decision-makers. The degree to which they are \nable to make autonomous decisions will be determined by both their level of incapacity (in terms \nof their ability to understand) and the degree of complexity or invasiveness of the procedure. The \nethical principle of 'harm' and the right of all patients to the protection of their body integrity is \npivotal to the facts presented in the scenario. Patients, regardless of their level of intellect, are \nentitled to medical treatment that is based upon sound and knowledgeable clinical practice. All \npatients are entitled to be treated equally and not be discriminated against based on factors such \nas their level of disability. \n",

You are seven months pregnant and having a \nlife-threatening haemorrhage. You believe the baby is still alive, but do not know whether it will \nsurvive. \nOpening statement \n‘I do not want a blood transfusion as I am a Jehovah's Witness.' \nThe candidate should counsel you that a blood transfusion is necessary in order to avert a very \nhigh likelihood of dying from blood loss for both you and your baby. DO NOT agree to this at any \npoint during the interview. Remain determined to refuse the transfusion. \nQuestions to ask unless already covered: \n• \n'Can t you save me and the baby without a blood transfusion?' \n• \n'Can t you deliver the baby now without transfusing me?' \nAfter six minutes, the examiner should ask the candidate: \n• \n'Summarise the legal and ethical issues in this situation.' \n• \n'What will you do — how would you manage this situation?' \nEXPECTATIONS OF CANDIDATE PERFORMANCE \nThe candidate should understand the ethical issues of autonomy and the patient's right as an \nadult of sound mind to self-determine her treatment. \nHowever a patient's right to be autonomous is restricted by the potential to damage a third \nperson. \nIf candidates are not able to counsel the mother in relation to the potential damage to the infant \nand are unable to obtain consent for transfusion they could seek an emergency order from the \nCourt to commence the transfusion, although they are most unlikely to receive permission to do \nso. \nIn Australia, the fetus has no 'rights' justifying treatment being forced on the mother against her \nwishes, as until the baby is born it is most unlikely any Court would force any treatment on the \nmother to improve the chances of fetal survival. \nOnce the baby is born, the possibility of transfusing the baby changes completely. \n",

      "text": "123 \nPerformance Guidelines \n653 \nThe Human Tissue Act (1982) in Victoria allows children to be transfused without parental \nconsent providing that without a transfusion the child was likely to die, and providing two medical \npractitioners concurred in that opinion before the administration of the blood transfusion. Similar \nActs in other states allow the same. \nFor other treatments an application can be made to a court to have the delivered baby made a \n'Ward of Court' and subsequently treated as necessary, but this requirement does not exist for \nblood transfusion itself. \nThe candidate therefore needs to cover the following: \n• Urgent delivery by Caesarean section is required as the best measure to save the mother's life \n(and baby). The baby would not die of blood loss but of hypoxia (lack of oxygen delivery \ncarried by red cells) due to maternal shock. \n• Blood transfusion is clearly advisable in a shocked patient with continuing blood loss, to \nimprove the mother's and baby's change of survival, and would normally be given before and \nduring the operation. \n• Transfusion of products not derived from blood are not nearly as useful as they do not carry \noxygen, although various synthetic blood substitutes (Haemaccel®, Macrodex®, etc.) can \nimprove the blood volume and reduce the apparent shock; but clearly hypoxia becomes the \nlimiting factor with continuous blood loss of 40% blood volume or more. \n• If blood transfusion is absolutely refused the chance of maternal death is markedly increased, \nalthough the fetus may survive if the operation is done immediately. \n• The mother has the right to refuse a blood transfusion. There is a case in Australia where the \nhusband, who was also a Jehovah's Witness, ultimately gave permission for a blood \ntransfusion to be given to his wife, because she had lapsed into unconsciousness and was \nunable to give consent or continue to refuse blood transfusion at the time. A court recently \nupheld the appropriateness of the husband's right to make the decision and for the hospital \nstaff to then transfuse the woman. This would not be possible in this case, as the husband is \nnot contactable, so the previous wishes of the woman would have to be accepted and \nfollowed. \n \nKEY ISSUES \n• Ability to deal with strong religious views in a respectful manner. \n• Ability to recognise the priorities in this emergency situation and respond appropriately \n• Recognising that urgent Caesarean section is required as the bleeding is continuing and \ncausing persisting shock and urgent operation is the only way of controlling persisting \nbleeding, despite the risks which an operation would entail. \n \nCRITICAL ERRORS \n• Not finding out Miriam's definitive wishes about treatment. \n• Indicating they would transfuse Miriam without obtaining a valid consent (either from Miriam or \nfrom her husband if Miriam was no longer conscious and capable of providing any opinion, for \nexample after Miriam had lost consciousness). \n",

      "text": "123 \nPerformance Guidelines \n654 \nCOMMENTARY  \nThis case raises the issues of a legally valid consent. Obtaining a valid consent is a process for \nensuring that patients can have control over what happens to them. One important part of this is \nensuring that patients are competent and have sufficient information so that they can understand \nthe implications of their decisions. Another important part of informed consent is that patients \nhave the right to make their medical decisions free from undue controlling influences, \nmanipulation or coercion. \nThese can be hard to define, as many decisions that patients make are influenced by their \ncircumstances, or the wishes or feelings of their relatives. For example, elderly patients may \nrefuse elective surgery because they are the principal carer for their frail partner and do not wish \nto relinquish this role, however briefly. In this situation, where Miriam is faced with a ife-or-death \nchoice with well known religious implications, it is very important that she should be offered the \nopportunity to discuss her decision about treatment in privacy. From an ethical perspective, \nMiriam's right to be an autonomous decision-maker is not actually restricted by any impact her \ndecision will have on her baby, although it would be restricted if the decision was one involving \nblood transfusion to her baby following delivery if this was necessary to preserve life. Australian \nlaw does not protect the unborn child from apparently inappropriate maternal decisions regarding \ncare, and practitioners in Australia need to be aware of this. \n",

You have been suffering from this \ndisease for approximately one year. You have had several periods of hospitalisation and have \nbeen treated aggressively for the last twelve months. \nDuring your last period of hospitalisation you were given the alternatives of continuing with the \ntreatment, which may extend your life for a further six months or stopping the treatment and being \ndischarged home. \nYou have chosen to stop the treatment and spend your remaining time at home with your family. \nYou have an indwelling catheter, nasogastric tube and a cannula for intravenous therapy in situ. \nYou are at home with your husband and two adult children who are caring for you. You have been \nvery pleased with the care you have received from your general practitioner (who has been your \ndoctor for the past ten years). \nNow that you are at home the general practitioner has assumed the responsibility for co-\nordinating your medical care. To that end, you are seen daily by the oncology and community \nnurses who carry out your daily health care. \nYour general practitioner has arrived to assess your condition and review your medications. \nOpening statement \n'Doctor, we all know I am dying. I have thought about this very seriously for months. I \nknow you're giving me something for the pain but I want you to prescribe something I \ncan use to end my life'. \nIf the candidate expresses inability to do that, say: \n‘I told you right from the start I would not be able to endure this. I have thought it all \nthrough very carefully I have had enough of this. I don't want to live any longer. I am \nnever going to get better. I want you to give me something to bring all this to an end'. \nIf the candidate still expresses inability to assist in bringing about your death, say:  \n‘I'm an increasing burden on everyone. My husband and children are exhausted from \ncaring for me. They are upset all the time and we all know that I am going to die. We \nmight as well just get it over with. I don't want them to remember me as a burden on \nthem. The thought of them having to look after me all day and all night is making my \nlast days too upsetting for all of us'. \nIf the candidate continues to decline to assist, say: \n'Well, why can't you? You're supposed to be my doctor and I am not going to recover. \nI am scared of the pain. What are you going to do? You have to do something for me'. \n",

Not only are there the autonomous wishes of a \ncompetent patient to consider, the doctor may also feel that it is in Sally's best interests to relieve \nher suffering, even if this includes ending her life. Obviously candidates must comply with the \nlaw, but some acknowledgement and discussion of the moral tensions may display awareness of \nthese issues. \nAs stated, the candidate should constructively address legal avenues for relief of suffering, \nincluding adequate analgesia and possible use of antidepressants. In the context of discussing \nanalgesia, some familiarity of the 'Doctrine of Double Effect' may be expected. \nThe Doctrine of Double Effect is an argument to justify medical actions which, while intending to \nrelieve suffering, may also hasten death. \n• The act itself must be morally permissible. \n• The ill effect, while foreseen, must be unintended. \n• The ill effect must not be disproportionate to the good effect. \n• The ill effect is not the means by which the good effect is achieved. \n• The classic example is that of administering morphine to a terminally ill person, with the aim of \nrelieving suffering but in the knowledge that the accompanying respiratory depression will \nhasten death.

      "text": "MCAT \nTrial Examinations — Two Papers \n662 \nMCAT TRIAL EXAMINATIONS — PREPARATORY INSTRUCTIONS \nIn sitting for the clinical examination of the Australian Medical Council, a number of basic \nprinciples should be born in mind. These are: \n• The tasks are indicated to you at the entrance to the station. These must be read \nCAREFULLY to ensure you are aware of exactly what you have to do, so that you are able to \nplan and use the eight minutes of your contact time with the patient and examiner \nappropriately, and ensure you cover all of the tasks listed. \n• If one of your tasks is to take a focused history, this is exactly what you should do. This means \nthat a full, detailed history is not expected, but that you should concentrate on the matters \nwhich are relevant to your tasks. In many stations, you are advised of the approximate time \nyou should spend taking this history, before you proceed to the remaining tasks. \n• The real patients or the role-playing standardised patients have been advised in advance of \nhow they should perform in the consultation, the questions they are likely to be asked, the \nreplies expected to those questions, and the questions they should ask for clarification of a \npoint. Appropriate questions have been designed to determine the clinical ability of the \ncandidate in the task areas defined. \n• If one of your tasks is to perform a focused examination, again this is what you should do. An \nexamination of the cardiovascular system, for example, would clearly include assessment of \nthe pulse rate, blood pressure, jugular venous pulse, heart, and lungs. It would also include \nexamination of the hands, fingers, and ankles. You should preferably describe your findings to \nthe examiner as the examination proceeds, or summarise these at the end of the examination, \nbut beware of running out of time in the latter case. \n• If you are advised to ask the examiner for the relevant and focused clinical findings you would \nlook for on physical examination to aid diagnosis, you need to indicate precisely what aspects \nof physical examination you wish to do, what positive or negative findings you wish to look for, \nand ask the examiner specifically for these. \n• If you are advised of, or wish to ask the examiner for, the results of previous investigations \nwhich you would expect to be available at the time of consultation, again you will need to \nrequest specifically which results you require from the examiner. The examiner may ask you \nwhy you require these results. If the tests have not been done, you will be advised of this. \n• Office tests which you would perform at the time of consultation and which would contribute to \nthe diagnosis should be asked for, such as urinalysis, haemoglobin, ECG findings, glucometer \nreadings and urinary pregnancy testing. \n• In some stations, you will need to request other appropriate tests to assist you to make a \ndiagnosis. If this is the case, you may or may not be given the results of these tests — it \ndepends how the scenario has been designed as to whether the results are available and \ngiven to you. Usually, results will only be available for tests previously performed, \n• In responding to patients' and relatives' questions, remember to avoid medical terms which \nthe nonmedical questioner would not be expected to understand. Avoid medical jargon. If you \npersistently use medical terminology and not lay terminology, despite the patient requesting \nclarification in lay terms, you will almost certainly be marked adversely. \n• In some scenarios, you need to respond briefly to specific questions from the examiner about \ndiagnosis or management, or to give a case summary. Be clear and concise: remember the \npatient is also listening. \n• Your performance will be assessed by the examiner, who will take into account your \nperformance in a number of marking categories. Currently 14 such categories exist, with \n",

For some stations, there will be predetermined critical errors which, if \ncommitted, would usually result in the candidate being given a FAIL grade for that particular \nstation. The stations are designed to assess broad clinical consultative abilities over areas of \ncommunication, diagnosis and management, associated reasoning skills, and ethical aspects \nof medical practice. \nThe current marking domains are as follows and are detailed in full for each condition near the \nend of the book: \n• Approach to patient and responses to patient's questions \n• Patient counselling/education \n• History-taking \n• Physical examination — choice and technique \n• Physical examination — accuracy \n• Choice of investigations \n• Interpretation of investigation results \n• Diagnosis/Differential diagnosis \n• Initial management plan \n• Clinical procedure — explanation \n• Clinical procedure — performance \n• Clinical procedure — familiarity with test equipment \n• Commentary to examiner \n• Answers to examiner's questions \n• Each marking domain is designated as a key or non-key domain, and each must be marked in \none of the four options provided. \nVery satisfactory             Pass \nSatisfactory                      Pass \nUnsatisfactory \nFail \nVery unsatisfactory         Fail \n• A final global mark of PASS or FAIL is then given for each station. \n• In general if the candidate gets one very unsatisfactory grade in a key area, or two \nunsatisfactory grades in key areas, the final global mark will be a FAIL. \n• In the actual clinical examination, candidates have four rest stations in addition to the 16 active \nstations which are marked. Each of the rest stations is just that. No prereading or writing can \nbe done at these rest stations, and candidates are advised to use them as a rest, and not think \nabout what they might have said or done at a previous station, as it is not possible to retrace \nsteps to that station and be re-marked! \n• Three of the stations generally cover problems in obstetrics/gynaecology, three in paediatrics, \ntwo in psychiatry, five in medicine and three in surgery. \n• To pass this 16-station examination, candidates must pass at least 12 stations, and this must \ninclude at least 1 of the 3 obstetrics/gynaecology stations, and at least 1 of the 3 paediatric \nstations. Passing only 10 or 11 stations (including at least 1 obstetric/ gynaecology and 1 \npaediatric station) would qualify for the 8-station retest. Failing all obstetric/gynaecology or all \npaediatric stations or passing 9 or less stations is a clear fail grade in this 16-station \nexamination. \nBest wishes to candidates for the examinations. \n",

If cardiotocography is abnormal, further \naction may be required. \n• The candidate should indicate that a pelvic examination is required to assess the progress of \nlabour and to make sure the cord has not prolapsed and is the cause of the meconium staining \nof the liquor. In the absence of any CTG abnormality, or abnormal PV finding on vaginal \nexamination, the labour should be allowed to progress. Providing normal progress occurs, and \nthe CTG remains normal, the labour should be allowed to proceed so that vaginal delivery is \nultimately possible. If a minor abnormality in the CTG recording occurs, it is possible to assess \nthe significance of this by measuring the fetal scalp pH or lactate level. If this is clearly \nabnormal, Caesarean section or vaginal manipulative delivery may be necessary. \n• At the time of vaginal delivery, adequate aspiration of the mouth, pharynx, and nasal cavity is \nessential in an attempt to prevent any inhalation of meconium into the respiratory tract of the \nbaby. Visualisation of the vocal cords, immediately after birth, with aspiration of meconium in \nany adjacent region is also required. A paediatrician is desirable at delivery, if one is available, \nto ensure that the resuscitation is adequate, and to commence any further therapy which \nmight be required should the baby inhale any meconium. If the candidate fails to provide the \ninformation concerning the need for aspiration of meconium from the mouth and nasal \npassages at the time of delivery, the examiner should indicate that the patient is suddenly \nready for delivery and ask 'what wi!l you need to do at delivery?' \nAmnioinfusion is being advocated in some centres in an attempt to prevent meconium aspiration \nsyndrome. This has still not achieved widespread acceptance, however, and would not usually \nbe included as part of clinical practice by most obstetricians. \n \nKEY ISSUES \n• Understanding the relevance of the meconium staining of the liquor. \n• Understanding the management required. \n \nCRITICAL ERRORS \n• Failure to do vaginal examination to check cervical dilatation and exclude cord prolapse. \n• Failure to adequately monitor the baby throughout the rest of the labour using continuous CTG \nassessment. \n• Failure to aspirate the mouth and pharynx adequately, at delivery, to reduce the risk of \nmeconium aspiration. \n",

It is important to understand that, \nalthough the presence of meconium may be a normal accompaniment of term (or slightly \npost-term) pregnancies, the sudden appearance of meconium when the membranes rupture \nmandates the subsequent necessity of monitoring of the baby throughout the remainder of the \nlabour. It should also be remembered that that baby's pharynx and mouth must be adequately \naspirated at birth to prevent meconium aspiration syndrome. \nCommon problems likely with candidate performance are: \n• An apparent lack of understanding that meconium staining of the liquor is common in \npost-term labour and does not imply the baby is in extreme difficulty. \n• Pelvic examination to exclude cord prolapse and continuous CTG monitoring are required to \ndetermine whether the baby is at risk of hypoxia.

You have just moved to the area and are attending this \ngeneral practice for the first time. Your daughter's murmur was first found at two years of age. \nYou were not particularly concerned, as you had previously been told that the murmur would \nprobably go away. You are much more concerned now if you are told that this is a hole in the \nheart. \nOpening Statement \n'Our previous doctor said this murmur might go away, and not to worry about it, but \nhave it checked each year' \nQuestions to ask unless already covered: \n• 'What do you think is causing this, doctor?' \n• ‘Are there special precautions we should take with Alyssa?' \n• 'Should she play sport?' \n•  'Can you explain these investigations you are recommending?' \n• 'Are they painful?' \n• ‘I have just booked the whole family in to see a dentist. Do I need to mention this to \nhim?' \nEXPECTATIONS OF CANDIDATE PERFORMANCE \nExplanation of diagnosis \nThe candidate should explain the following in lay terms that the parent can understand: \nThe murmur is due to a condition that requires specialist investigation, most likely a 'hole in the \nheart' (small ventricular septal defect). Its features should be explained briefly. The prognosis is \nusually very good. In some cases spontaneous closure can occur although this becomes less \nlikely by the age of five. No restriction of activity is required and normal activities should be \nencouraged. Special investigations are needed to make the diagnosis - chest X-ray, ECG and \nechocardiogram. These noninvasive procedures should be explained. Referral to an appropriate \nspecialist — paediatrician/paediatric cardiologist if possible — is required. Regular dental care is \nimportant; appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis will be required for potentially contaminated dental \nwork and surgical procedures. Yearly review with cardiologist most likely to be required until it is \ndetermined whether the lesion will close and how large it is. The signs would suggest it is small \nand may not warrant operative closure. \n",

She \nhas a known murmur considered innocent, but a careful cardiological examination points to a \npathological murmur due to a potentially serious heart condition, most likely ventricular septal \ndefect (VSD). Knowledge of the key clinical features of childhood cardiac murmurs is expected. \nExplanation of the indications for prophylactic antibiotic in the presence of a heart murmur is also \nrequired. \nHeart murmurs are common in children and over 40% of healthy 4-year-olds may have a soft \ninnocent heart murmur if careful auscultation is carried out. The medical practitioner therefore \nmust recognise the features that distinguish innocent from significant murmurs. The presence of \na loud pansystolic murmur with a thrill indicates an organic lesion and warrants investigation. \nThe echocardiogram, a noninvasive investigation, is usually able to clearly define the lesion and \nno other investigations are necessary. However, most cardiologists also perform an ECG and \nchest X-ray as part of the workup. A small VSD may be so small as to not warrant any surgical \nclosure as it is not haemodynamically significant and will cause no clinical problem to the patient. \nHowever, the patient and family must be warned and constantly reminded of the need for \nappropriate antibiotic prophylaxis for any operative or dental procedure. \nAll doctors caring for children must be cognisant of the features of an innocent murmur and the \nimportant differences between a functional and an organic murmur. \n",

This will depend on the \nclinical state of the baby and the results of the blood tests. \n• Explain the need for surgery (referral to paediatric surgeon for surgery when diagnosis \nestablished) and the principle of pyloromyotomy. \n• Indicate that the prognosis is excellent. \n• Reassure that a person skilled in giving anaesthetics to young infants will give the \nanaesthetic. \n• Indicate that after surgery, baby will be able to feed from the breast within a few hours.

The great majority of babies posset after \nfeeds (they bring up effortlessly small amounts of milk, occasionally associated with burping). \nThere are however important pathological conditions that must be considered and excluded in \nany baby who has persistent vomiting. \nThe important features in this scenario are the forceful or projectile vomiting that the parents \ndescribe, and that the baby appears hungry all the time. As the history has been for only two \ndays, this picture is compatible with pyloric stenosis. With pyloric stenosis, after several days of \nvomiting and with progressive dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, the baby will become \nlethargic and uninterested in feeds. \nWhile other diagnoses may be entertained, for example, oesophageal reflux or urinary tract \ninfection, the clinical features usually differentiate these conditions. With reflux, although \nprojectile vomiting can occur, it is not persistent. Urinary infection is often associated with an \nunwell infant and possibly fever. \n",

      "text": "127 (T3) \nPerformance Guidelines \n687 \nWhen pyloric stenosis is suspected, the clinical examination should involve a test feed and during \nthe feed the clinician looks for active peristaltic waves travelling from left to right across the upper \nabdomen. The best time to feel the tumour, is when the wave reaches the right side of the \nabdomen and it commonly will be felt immediately after the baby has vomited. \nInvestigations to confirm the diagnosis may be helpful, but except for electrolyte and acid/base \nstatus, may be unnecessary if the tumour can be easily felt and the classical history is present. \nThese investigations however may include ultrasound that may demonstrate the tumour and \nbarium swallow with the classic 'string' sign of a narrowed pyloric canal. \nThe most important investigations to assess the baby's general clinical state are electrolytes and \nurea/creatinine and acid/base studies. These will usually show significant abnormalities with \nhypochloraemic alkalosis. These abnormalities should be corrected with appropriate intravenous \nfluids before the baby undergoes corrective surgery. \nThe effective treatment is Ramstedt pyloromyotomy where the thickened pylorus is split \nsurgically down to the mucosa but not through the mucosa. This treatment resolves the problem \nvery effectively. \nThe parents should be advised that the baby will be able to resume feeding soon after the \nsurgery and usually can be discharged from hospital within 24 hours of operation. The condition \nis often associated with a strong family history, which if present, should alert the clinician to the \npossibility of this diagnosis. \n",

Full general \nexamination is normal. Blood pressure 150/90 mmHg. No evidence of any abnormal \nmasses in the abdomen. \n• Speculum examination: The vaginal epithelium appears atrophic. There is minimal \nprolapse of the anterior vaginal wall, but no prolapse of the uterus or posterior vaginal wall. \nWhen she was asked to cough, loss of a small amount of urine from the urethra was \ndemonstrated. \n• Pelvic vaginal examination (PVE): uterus is not enlarged, and both adnexae appear \nnormal. \n• Investigation results: none done. \nEXPECTATIONS OF CANDIDATE PERFORMANCE \nThe candidate should convey the substance of the following to the patient. \nThe diagnosis is almost certainly that of mixed 'urge' incontinence (associated with a sudden \nneed to void) and stress incontinence (associated with straining stresses). \n • She should be advised that the following plan of management is required: \n~ A urine microscopy and culture should be performed to exclude a urinary tract infection, \nwhich could be the cause of the urinary frequency. If this was found antibiotic therapy \nwould be required \n~ Due to the apparent mixed nature of the incontinence, she needs referral for a urodynamic \nassessment. These studies should be expected to confirm this diagnosis, and to see which \ncomponent appears to be worse. \n~ In view of her desire to avoid an operation, when the results of the urodynamic assessment \nare to hand, decisions can be made on nonoperative care. \n~ If there is proven genuine stress incontinence (GSI), there is a place for pelvic floor \nexercises, and even the use of a pessary to correct the anterior wall vaginal prolapse In \naddition she should be advised to lose weight and stop smoking, as the latter will almost \ncertainly reduce her coughing episodes, and weight loss back to ideal body weight usually \nimproves GSI. \n~ If there is clear evidence of detrusor instability, the use of drugs such as propantheline \n(Probanthine®) and imipramine (Tofranil®), or oxybutynin (Ditropan®) should be \nconsidered. HRT may also improve urinary urgency as well and could be tried for 1-2 years \nwith minimal risk to the patient. Retraining of the bladder, so it accepts a larger volume \nbefore emptying, may also be important if detrusor instability is the major problem defined \nin the urodynamic testing. \n~ If medical treatment is ineffective, and the predominant problem is genuine stress \nincontinence, it may ultimately be necessary for her to have surgery.

Ongoing support is appropriate in all cases. \n• Attention to lifestyle and other trigger factors. \n• Preventive medication is not required in this patient with only two attacks; but is indicated for \nthree \nor \nmore \nattacks \na \nmonth, \nselecting \nfrom: \nbeta \nblockers/pizotifen/ \ncyproheptadine/tricyclic antidepressants/methysergide/calcium channel blockers. All these \nmedications can have significant side effects. \n~ beta blockers — contraindicated in asthmatics; adverse effects of tiredness and bradycardia; \n      ~pizotifen — adverse effects of drowsiness and weight gain; \n      ~cyproheptadine — adverse effects of drowsiness and weight gain; \n~ tricyclic antidepressants — impaired alertness, anticholinergic, autonomic side effects;  \n~ methysergide — six months use only; adverse effects include vasospastic \nsyndromes, retroperitoneal fibrosis.  \n~ calcium channel blockers — indicated in severe, life-disrupting cases only, because \nof adverse effects; use is for a limited time only to break the cycle; can give \nimprovement in majority of cases. \nKEY ISSUES \n• Counselling and patient education. \n• Appropriate drug therapy according to severity and including preventive measures, \n \nCRITICAL ERRORS  \n• Failure to adequately address the treatment of acute attacks. \n• Failure to consider trigger factors. \nCOMMENTARY \nMigraine is a common disorder encountered in everyday clinical practice by both general \npractitioners and specialists. \nAdvice about its management requires adequate consulting time in contrast to its diagnosis. \nEffective patient education and counselling are required to achieve a successful outcome \nincluding patient acceptance of likely recurrences — this requires satisfactory use of \ncommunication skills by the candidate. \nTherapy involves both attention to lifestyle factors and choice of medication from a wide range of \nalternatives. \nA correct choice of therapy depends on the level of severity of the migraine and this initial \nconsultation provides a starting point for ongoing care. \nThe information included under expectations of candidate performance provides a sound basis \nfor future practice by the candidate. \n",

The candidate is not expected to cover all aspects to acquire a satisfactory pass. \nThe examiner will have instructed the patient as follows: \nYou are a 35-year-old man who sustained a posterior dislocation of the right hip in a motor \nvehicle accident five years ago. There were no associated injuries, the dislocation was reduced \nunder general anaesthesia and you had a period of bed rest with traction followed by graduated \nambulation and weight bearing. You have been well since and have noted no problems apart \nfrom occasional aching on prolonged exercise. You are presenting for a checkup for insurance \npurposes. This station involves the candidate examining your hip joints. Be cooperative. You may \nbe asked to walk and to step up on a couch or stool. \nPlease respond naturally to the requests of the doctor as the examination proceeds.  \nEXPECTATIONS OF CANDIDATE PERFORMANCE \nThe candidate is expected to perform a well organised, logical and sequential examination of the \nright hip region, comparing signs with the normal left hip. There will be no abnormal physical \nfindings in this case. \n• Trendelenburg test/gait — performs and describes competently. The test is positive if the \nopposite buttock sags, rather than being elevated, when the patient stands on the affected leg \n(Trendelenburg test — 'sound side sags'), or during walking (Trendelenburg lurching gait to \naffected side). \n• Limb length with patient supine — should level pelvis with legs symmetrically placed, in \nanatomical position. Checks for any apparent or real discrepancy in leg length, using a tape \nmeasure. Avascular necrosis of femoral head could cause true shortening above greater \ntrochanter. \n• Hip joints each side — observes for deformity — Thomas test for fixed flexion deformity \n(exposed by flexing opposite hip to flatten lumbar lordosis). \n• Observes for wasting/tenderness \n• Observes ranges of movement (active and passive) — checks for pain/crepitus. \n~ Flexion/extension — forward from 0° anatomical position (normal range 0-100°), normally \nlimited by apposition of thigh and abdomen, backward extension while prone from 0° \nanatomical position (normal range 0-20°), normal range of flexion-extension \napproximately 120°. \n~ Abduction/adduction — pelvis must be fixed. Checks abduction from anatomical position \n(0-40° range); adduction across other leg (normal range 0-20° or halfway up thigh), normal \nrange of abduction/adduction approximately 60°. \n",

Normal range of external-internal \nrotation is approximately 90°. \n \n• Sciatic nerve function - - checks no post-dislocation weakness or sensory loss. \n• Further tests required — could recommend imaging to check for any signs of accelerated \narthritis. There is no obvious problem detected on clinical examination, and no symptoms; a \nbaseline plain X-ray or computed tomograph (CT) would be acceptable but not obligatory. \nKEY ISSUES  \n• Technique of examination of hips. \n• Confirmation of normal findings. \n• Quality of commentary to examiner. \nCRITICAL ERROR  \n• Failing to adequately assess the range of movements of the hip joint. \nCOMMENTARY  \nThe hip joint is designed for stability combined with a flexible range of movements, of which \nflexion has the greatest range and extension the least. The bony configuration and strong \nligaments surrounding the joint, particularly the very strong anterior ligaments, protect the joint \nagainst dislocation under normal strains. Support is weakest posteriorly which is the most \ncommon site for traumatic dislocations. The sciatic nerve is at risk posteriorly. The most \nconcerning longterm complication is accelerated arthritis due to interference with the blood \nsupply of the head of the femur or to traumatic chondromalacia. \n",

Wear street clothes. Be cooperative if asked questions or to elaborate \nsymptoms, but otherwise not forthcoming or spontaneous. Appear sometimes vague, asking for \nquestions to be repeated, as if finding concentration difficult. Avoid eye contact — keep eyes \ndowncast.

Your sleep is broken, and over the \npast few weeks, you wake up at 4 am, feeling restless and bothered by all kinds of thoughts, and \ndo not get back to sleep. You often take a Panadeine® (paracetamol/ codeine) to aid sleep. You \nfeel better later in the day and after you have had a glass of wine. You have started drinking at \nlunchtime now. You cannot be bothered with other people, and have given up your regular tennis. \nYou have no interest in sex. \nYou think your life is not worth living. You have had passing thoughts.of taking an overdose or \ngassing yourself. You have no active plans or suicidal impulses. You miss your children a lot, and \nworry about your and their future. \nResponses to direct questions \nReview of general health: you have had weight loss of about 5 kg in six months; no previous \nepisodes of weight loss or gain. Poor appetite. Constipation is a problem, for the first time in your \nlife. \nReview of relevant systems: negative response to all other systems.  \nSocial History \nYour wife left you six months ago, taking the children, and you have not had any regular contact \nwith them since.

In taking \nthe history the candidate needs therefore to elicit the key symptoms of major depression, \nincluding psychomotor retardation and slowing with fatigue, sleep disturbance, early morning \nwakening, weight loss, poor concentration, anhedonia and suicidal thoughts. \nThe candidate must also obtain the history of present alcohol abuse, habitual and excess \nconsumption, details of other substance misuse, and a relevant systems review. The candidate \nmust take some psychosocial history, namely the marital breakdown and social isolation as these \nare highly relevant to the case and further management. Suicide risk assessment is critical. A \nformal extended cognitive state examination is not possible but the candidate should be able to \ncomment on cognitive state and memory as reflected in the history provided. \nThe case also involves consideration of relevant investigations. These include physical problems \nthat may present as depression (e.g. hypothyroidism, frontal lobe impairment, anaemia, or \nmalignancy) and physical consequences of alcohol abuse (particularly hepatic and \ngastrointestinal disease). \nAt first glance this may seem a complicated case, but both depression and alcohol abuse are \nvery common mental health problems, with high levels of disability; and they often coexist. \n",

Your shortness of breath comes on when showering or dressing or when going for short \nwalks on level ground. The doctor arranged breathing tests (spirometry and assessment of \ndiffusing capacity). You have returned today for further advice and information about the illness \nand treatment. You have been a courier driver all your life, delivering goods from a factory to the \ncustomer. You retired two years ago. \nQuestions to ask unless already covered: \n• 'What has caused this problem?' \n• 'Can you fix my lungs?' \n• 'Will it be harmful to exert myself if I need to?' \n• 'Will I need to take treatment everyday?' \n• 'Did anything at work cause this problem?' \n• ‘Can I continue to play golf?' \n• 'Will I get cancer?' \nBe very concerned about the future, the effectiveness of treatment and the possibility of \ndeveloping lung cancer. \nEXPECTATIONS OF CANDIDATE PERFORMANCE  \nThe candidate should correctly interpret the pulmonary function tests as showing significant \nobstructive airways disease with significant increase in total lung capacity and residual volume. \nThere is some change in the FEV^FVC (Forced Expiratory Volume/ Forced Vital Capacity) ratio \nfollowing a bronchodilator. There is significant impairment of diffusion capacity. \nThe candidate should cover the following: \n• Cause of the problem — almost certainly the heavy smoking of cigarettes.

      "text": "132 (T8) \nPerformance Guidelines \nCOMMENTARY  \nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) \nThis is a heterogeneous disorder that includes emphysema, chronic bronchitis, obliterative \nbronchiolitis and asthmatic bronchitis. It is defined as 'a disease state characterised by airflow \nlimitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is both progressive and is associated \nwith an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases'. The \ndiagnosis should be considered in a patient with symptoms of cough, sputum production and \ndyspnoea, and/or with a history of exposure to risk factors. The clinical course of COPD is \ninfluenced by multiple factors: genetic susceptibility, low birth weight, maternal smoking, \ninfections in the first year of life, asthma in childhood, and exposure to inhaled irritants in the \nworkplace and environmental air pollution. More than 80% of cases can be attributed to smoking. \nAlpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency occurs in about 2% of patients with emphysema and patients \nshould be screened early in the course of the disease, particularly if there is family history of \neither lung or liver disease. \nSpirometry confirms the diagnosis and is useful for assessing severity. The GOLD guidelines1 \nclassify patients in 4 stages linked to forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital \ncapacity (FVC): \nStage 0: At risk — characterised by chronic cough and sputum production. The lung function is \nnormal. \nStage I: Mild COPD — with mild airflow limitation with an FEV1/FVC < 70% but FEV1 is > 80% of \npredicted. Some have cough and sputum production. \nStage II: Moderate COPD — characterised by worsening airflow limitation: HA with an FEV1 \n50-80%; IIB 30-50% of predicted. Usually there is progression of symptoms with shortness of \nbreath typically on exertion. There may be frequent exacerbations with an impact on quality of \nlife. \nStage III: Severe COPD — characterised by severe airflow limitation with an FEV1 < 30% \npredicted or the presence of respiratory failure or clinical signs or right heart failure. These \npatients usually have a poor quality of life. \nLung Volume Measurements \nTotal lung capacity comprises a number of components: tidal volume (TV), inspiratory reserve \nvolume (IRV), expiratory reserve volume (ERV), and residual volume (RV). In COPD total lung \ncapacity (TLC) is increased largely because of increased RV and functional residual capacity \n(FRC). Vital capacity (VC) is usually decreased but may be normal. \nManagement \nManagement of COPD involves: \n• Education of patients and their families. \n• Retarding the progression by early detection and avoiding risk factors. \n• Minimising airflow limitation by reducing the production and increased elimination of \nsecretions. \n• Utilising bronchodilators effectively. \n1 Pauwels RA.

Frequently, a \nlong-acting β2-agonist (salmeterol, eformoterol) is combined with an anticholinergic (ipratropium \nbromide, trotropium). Additional use of short-acting β2-agonist (fenoterol, salbutamol, terbutaline) \nis often required for symptom relief. The use of oral theophylline is limited by its potential toxicity, \nparticularly cardiac toxicity, and if used, drug levels should be monitored. \nProlonged treatment with inhaled corticosteroids does not modify the longterm decline in FEV1. \nThe GOLD guidelines recommend regular use of inhaled steroids in those patients with FEV1 < \n50% of predicted or those in Stage III with frequent exacerbations and in these patients this can \nreduce exacerbations and preserve quality of life. A therapeutic trial of up to three months is \nrecommended. \nProlonged treatment with oral glucocorticoids (prednisolone) is NOT recommended in COPD \nand may lead to severe side effects, in particular steroid myopathy and osteoporosis, which can \nseverely affect patients with COPD. Short courses, however are very useful in acute \nexacerbations. \nCombination medications that may be especially useful in appropriate patients with more severe \ndisease, include ipratropium-salbutamol, fluticasone-salmeterol. \nOxygen therapy \nIn patients with COPD it is important to monitor oxygen saturation levels. Arterial blood gases are \nusually obtained at baseline for comparison during subsequent exacerbations. In patients with \nmore severe disease, severe arterial hypoxaemia, respiratory acidosis and hypercapnia are \ncommon as is secondary polycythaemia and pulmonary hypertension. It is important to evaluate \npatients with more severe disease for suitability of home oxygen therapy. \nPatient education in use of MDI and spacer device \nSee also http://www.asthmaaustralia.org.au. There are 2 types of aerosol inhalers: 'Puffer'— a \npress and breathe device and 'Autohaler'— a breath-activated device. \nIt is recommended that puffers are used with a 'spacer'. \nUsing a 'puffer': Remove cover from mouthpiece. Hold upright and shake vigorously. Breathe out \nand tilt chin up. Put 'puffer' mouthpiece in mouth and seal with lips. Start to breathe in through \nmouth, then fire one puff of medication and continue to breathe in. Hold breath for 10 seconds, \nthen breathe out via nose. Rinse mouth out after use of inhaled steroid. \nUsing a 'spacer': Attach 'puffer' to end of 'spacer'. Place 'spacer' mouthpiece in mouth and close \nlips around it. If using with a facemask, place facemask over mouth and nose to ensure a good \nseal. Press down on 'puffer' canister as illustrated once to release medication into the 'spacer'. \nBreathe in and out normally for about 4-5 seconds. 'Spacer' should be cleaned regularly with \nwarm soapy water and allowed to drip dry. \n",

The list of responses below is \nlikely to cover most of the questions you will be asked. \n• No cigarette smoking or alcohol intake. \n• No hypertension at any time and no previous renal disease. \n• No problem with lupus or arthritis in the past, and no thromboses in the past. \n• No contact with dogs or cats, and you do not eat raw meat. \n• Fetal movements are still present, but they are certainly less than they were. \n• The dates are certain, and these were confirmed by the 18-week ultrasound which was \napparently normal. \nQuestions to ask unless already covered: \n• 'Why hasn't my uterus increased in size?' \n• ‘Everyone says I look so small. Is my baby going to be OK?' \n• ‘When do you think I'll come into labour?' \n• 'Will I still be able to have my baby normally?' \n \nExamination findings and investigation results to be given to the candidate by the examiner on \nrequest \nSymphysis-fundal height is 29 cm, cephalic presentation, head three finger breadths \nabove the pelvic brim \nFetal heart audible, normal rate. \nBlood pressure 120/80 mmHg. \nNo oedema. \nTests: Investigation results — no proteinuria on ward testing. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) \nantibodies had been tested prior to pregnancy because of her work in the renal unit (IgG \nantibodies were positive). She has not been screened for toxoplasma antibodies. \n",

      "text": "706 \n133 (T9) \nPerformance Guidelines \n \n \n \nEXPECTATIONS OF CANDIDATE PERFORMANCE \nThis is a clinical problem of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). The reason for this IUGR, and \nits severity, need to be assessed by special investigations, and the timing and mode of delivery \nshould be discussed. \nInvestigations required should include: \n• Ultrasound examination to confirm the size of the baby, look for the amniotic fluid volume, and \nto see whether there is any obvious congenital abnormality which might explain the clinical \nIUGR. This examination will probably need to be repeated each 2-3 weeks. Blood flow in the \numbilical cord should also be assessed by Doppler studies. \n• Cardiotocographic evaluation (CTG) twice a week from now until the time of delivery. \n \nCauses of IUGR which need to be thought about are as follows: karyotypic abnormalities: renal \ndisease: pre-eclampsia; congenital infections (such as CMV or toxoplasmosis); or placental \ndysfunction (this would include a concealed placental abruption). \nThe appropriate investigations certainly include ultrasound examination and CTG, as referred to \nabove, but also serum urea, uric acid and creatinine looking for evidence of renal compromise, \nand measurement of the lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibody would be advisable \n(knowledgeable candidates may suggest all these tests). The antibodies for toxoplasmosis \nshould be sought and, if amniocentesis is being performed to assess the karyotype of the baby, \nas would often be advised, toxoplasmosis should be ruled out on this specimen as well. \nThe mode of delivery will probably be by Caesarean section, and almost certainly prior to the \nestimated due date. The timing of this will depend on the ultrasound evaluation, the CTG record, \nand the amount of growth which occurs subsequently. Providing the baby is not allowed to \nbecome hypoxic and acidotic, and does not have a congenital malformation or a congenital \ninfection, the longterm prognosis for the baby should be satisfactory. \n \nKEY ISSUES \n• Understanding the causes of oligohydramnios. \n• Management of a growth-restricted fetus in late pregnancy. \n \nCRITICAL ERRORS \n• Failure to recognise that the clinical picture is of intrauterine growth restriction. \n• Failure to arrange appropriate assessment (or referral to specialist). At the least ultrasound \nand serial CTG must be done. \n",

The most common of these is that the fetus is suffering \nfrom intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) with usually a degree of oligohydramnios.

You are a 25-year-old university student, living in a \nshare-house. You are usually in good health, your studies are going well. You drink 6-8 alcoholic \ndrinks at parties, but do not drink on a daily basis or have any alcohol-associated problems. \nYou do not use drugs. You have never been in hospital before. You have had no other \noperations, illnesses, accidents or injuries of any kind. There is no family history of any \npsychiatric or neurological illness. Any other background history, say ‘I can't be bothered with all \nthat now.' \nYou were out camping with mates. The fire was slow to start, so you threw some petrol over it. \nYou cannot remember exactly how long ago that was, maybe a day or so, or how you got to \nhospital. You know you are in hospital. You do not know which one, or for how long. You feel a bit \nnauseated, not hungry, and you are in pain. You feel as if you have not been sleeping at all, but \nyou don't know how the time has passed. When you do fall asleep, you are suddenly woken by \nvivid, frightening dreams — of being chased, being in a fire, or some other dangerous situation. \nThe last time, you thought it was the angel of death. When you wake, you see strange-looking \npeople in the room with you, and then they suddenly disappear. \nYou now feel too frightened to close your eyes, afraid that something bad will happen. You are \nfrightened that someone has given you the wrong drugs by mistake, and you don't think you \nshould trust the nursing staff because they don't seem to know what they are doing. \n• Whem asked further questions: \n~ Be quite cooperative, but subdued, answer the questions, and look a bit suspicious and \nperplexed about it all. \n• When the candidate tests your cognitive function (they may not check all of this): \n~ You know you are in hospital (don't know the name); you know your name (own), address \n(own), and age (25) and date of birth: (own day & month — current year minus 25). Give the \nwrong answer for today's day and date, but correct for month and year. Give the incorrect \nseason (with respect to the day of the exam). \n~ Be apologetic — you feel you are just guessing. Remember only two of the items you are \nasked to repeat, no matter how many repetitions, and none when asked after a \ngap in time: 'No, sorry, it is just gone'. Serial 7s: 100....93....85....70 . 'What was I \nup to?' 'World' backwards: d r I w o. \n~ Name any objects you are asked correctly, repeat any phrase you are given correctly, and \ncomplete the folded paper test or similar reasonably correctly. \n~ Write a sentence 'I am feeling sick'. \n",

When \nthe candidate asks you about seeing things, describe the visions that waken you, and the \ncreatures you see in the room. You are not hearing voices, and do not have any other odd \nor unusual experiences. \n• You are feeling afraid, and are beginning to think something must have gone wrong, you are \nnot being given the right drugs, or the nurses don't know what they are doing, but you are not \nconvinced of this, and can be talked out of it. \nQuestions to ask unless already covered: \n• 'Am I losing it?' \nIf/when the candidate explains you have a delirium/acute brain syndrome/acute confusional \nstate, and gives you a good explanation of the condition and its management, express relief \nand ask if you can have something to sleep now. \n• The explanation should be similar to the following: this is a common complication of major \ninjuries and their treatment, such as your burn. It will most likely get better along with your \nrecovery, but there are some common problems which need to be checked, ike infection, \nchanges in your fluid balance, and it may be a side effect of your pain relief. The visions and \nfears you have are part of the delirium, and do not mean you have a psychiatric illness such as \nschizophrenia. If the nursing staff knows about your fears, they can take extra care to explain \ntheir treatments to you, and they will also be careful about lighting, noise etc, as those \nenvironmental matters can be irritating. In the meantime, there are things that can be done to \nrelieve your symptoms, such as additional sedation, and changing your analgesic. \n \nEXPECTATIONS OF CANDIDATE PERFORMANCE \nThe candidate is expected to identify the nature of the psychologic problem by: \n• Taking a history about the presenting problem (inability to sleep), which should easily lead \nthem to the symptoms of visual hallucinations, a hallmark of an organic condition associated \nwith heightened arousal, nonspecific fear, with vague persecutory ideation, as well as \nshort-term memory deficits. \n• Confirming the diagnosis by performing a formal cognitive assessment (i.e. by assessment of \norientation/attention/concentration/memory; \ncould \nuse \nFolstein \nMini-Mental \nState \nExamination [MMSE], or other screening tool but not essential). The cognitive assessment will \nconfirm that the patient has significant deficits in orientation, attention concentration and \nshort-term \nmemory. \nThese \nare \nthe \nhallmark \nindicators \nof \nan \nacute \nbrain \nsyndrome/delirium/acute confusional state, especially in association with perceptual \ndisturbance, typically visual or tactile hallucinations, and disturbances of thinking, including \npersecutory ideation. \n• In the explanation to the patient of the problem, candidates must use appropriate clear and \nplain terminology, and must indicate they know that there is a need to assess the cause(s) of \nthe delirium. Whilst this aspect is not being further assessed at this station, they are expected \nto say they would start with a review of the likely physical causes of delirium, and that the most \nlikely cause is the ketamine or morphine. Knowledgeable candidates will focus in particular on \nthe ketamine, which is often associated with disturbed sleep and vivid and concerning \ndreams. \n• In this station, candidates are not required to proceed to do the investigations or change \nmedication. If they attempt to do so, inform them that they do not need to proceed further. \n",

If the candidate offers a diagnosis or differential diagnosis of functional psychosis (e.g. \nschizophrenia), do not ask them if it could be anything else or how certain they are, unless they \nindicate they are not entirely sure (i.e. don't hint they might be wrong). \nThe candidate must stipulate some likely causes of the condition, again using clear and plain \nterminology, and may specify medication to be used, but a schedule is not required. Appropriate \nspecific treatments are: \n• Discussion with nursing staff about explanation, reassurance, environmental control. \n• Cessation of morphine — by this stage after burn injuries further analgesia does not usually \nrequire opioids. \n• Avoid further drug therapy unless symptoms persist. If required, use an adequate dose of a \nmedium acting benzodiazepine (e.g. diazepam, lorazepam), with dose titrated to response — \npossibly a low dose of a sedative antipsychotic (e.g. olanzapine, being mindful of acute \nextrapyramidal side effects). \n \nKEY ISSUES \n• Ability to make a diagnosis of delirium, by taking both an adequate history and performing an \nadequate mental state examination. \n• Ability to formulate and communicate an initial management plan, which includes addressing \nthe cause of the delirium, and relieving the symptoms. \n \nCRITICAL ERRORS \n• Failing to make a diagnosis of delirium/acute brain syndrome. \n• Telling the patient he has schizophrenia or like illness. \n \nCOMMENTARY \nDelirium (acute brain syndrome) is an acute confusional state associated with acute impairment \nof consciousness. Disorientation, restlessness, agitation, illusions and hallucinations \nare common. \nDelirium and confusion may be precipitated by change from a familiar home environment to the \nunfamiliar and disturbing environment of the hospital ward.

It is important to \nrapidly obtain as adequate a history as is possible from the patient, relatives, and nursing staff, \nand to undertake a focused clinical examination looking for precipitating factors and identifiable \ndisorders, so that effective treatment can be instituted as quickly as possible, and so that the \npatient is not at continuing risk from physical injury arising from his confused state. \n",

Perceptual \nabnormalities (hallucinations); sleep-wake cycle abnormalities (typically inverted pattern — \nawake all night, dozing briefly during the day); mental sluggishness; poor attention and \nconcentration with distractibility; affective lability including fear, anxiety, depression or \ngrandiosity and aggression; ideas of reference and misinterpretations leading to paranoid or \nsuicidal/nihilistic ideation and delusions; psychomotor disturbance: either restless agitation or \nsomnolent retardation, any or all may occur in any combination. On recovery, most patients have \nno recall of their period of delirium. Some patients experience the features of so-called \n'near-death experiences'. \nMost patients in hospital with delirium have multiple factors which contribute to their confusion. \nAdvancing age and 'cerebral insufficiency', drug/alcohol effects, brain injury or infection and any \ncondition requiring intensive care are predisposing factors. \nTreatment involves recognition of the diagnosis and then identifying and correcting the \ncontributing factors. Pain, sleep deprivation, exhaustion, panic/terror and environmental factors \nmust not be overlooked. Assigning the same staff each shift to care for the patient and \nencouraging family and friends to sit with them are helpful, as is a quiet room with familiar objects \nfrom home nearby. Subdued lighting at night assists in orientation and reduces the likelihood of \nmisinterpretations. \nHaloperidol in low dosage twice daily can be used for agitation initially and can be safely used \nparenterally. Olanzapine is now available as an intramuscular alternative. The newer atypical \nantipsychotics are 'not approved' for use in delirium or in patients under 18 or over 65. \nShort acting benzodiazepines lorazepam, oxazepam and alprazolam may be preferable \nsedatives for use at night and in patients with liver disease. Diazepam may prolong or worsen \ndaytime confusion. Hypoalbuminaemia may mean the dosage of all protein-bound drugs must be \nreduced, including psychotropics, to limit medication toxicity from free drug in the circulation. \nOnce the patient has begun to improve the psychotropics should be reduced gradually and not \nstopped abruptly. \n",

You have been referred back to \nthe gastroenterology department of the hospital because you are not improving. \nOpening statement \n'I've still got diarrhoea. I was told by the last doctor I saw here to come back if it didn't \nclear up.' \nWith facilitation and minimal prompting by the doctor state: \nYou have to go to the toilet urgently five or six times every day and the bowel action is either \n'explosive' or just 'pours out' like water. You also pass a lot of wind, and notice a lot of gurgling \nnoises in your abdomen. Your abdomen also feels bloated on and off. The medicines you are \ntaking have not stopped the diarrhoea (Kaomagma® and Imodium® [loperamide]). The trouble \nstarted about six months ago and has been gradually getting worse. Three months ago you \ndeveloped a throat infection and were given a course of antibiotics. The diarrhoea was worse for \nthree weeks afterwards. At first your local doctor thought that this was the cause and advised you \nto eat yoghurt and less fatty food. However, the diarrhoea persisted and two months ago you \nwere referred to this clinic and had tests of your faeces for infections but these were clear. \nYou were referred for colonoscopy and advised that this was also normal; to take Imodium® \ncapsules as-required to control the diarrhoea, which was most likely due to irritable bowel \nsyndrome. You are now 'fed up' and want something done about your problem. Your back \npassage has become pretty sore and you are sick of the inconvenience. You are also feeling \nmore tired than usual and lack energy. \nIn response to direct questioning, provide the following answers: \n• No abdominal pain, never any blood or slime (mucus) in the motion. \n• The motion is paler in colour than before, sticks to the pan. and tends to float. It has a more \noffensive smell than usual. \n• When the urge comes on you have to go to the toilet immediately. This feeling has woken you \nat night. So far you have not soiled yourself. \n• On rising in the morning you need to go to open your bowels immediately. You usually have to \ngo soon after a meal. \n• The diarrhoea does not seem to be related to the type of food you eat except that it is less \nfrequent when you eat less. The Imodium® does help but you do not take it regularly. The \nKaomagma® does not make any difference. \n",

Differential diagnosis includes: coeliac disease, irritable bowel \nsyndrome, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, giardiasis, thyrotoxicosis, carcinoma colon \n(previously overlooked at colonoscopy), lactose intolerance, antibiotic-induced diarrhoea. Other \ncauses of malabsorption are less likely: tropical sprue, Whipple disease, intestinal \nlymphangiectasia, pseudomembranous enterocolitis, HIV. \nCoeliac disease is defined as the permanent intolerance to gluten (present in wheat, rye, oats \nand barley) resulting in small bowel villous atrophy and malabsorption. Symptoms improve by \nremoving gluten from the diet. \nThe frequency of coeliac disease is disputed, but in Europeans is possibly up to 1 in 300. It is \nlikely that many mild cases escape diagnosis. The condition is familial. There is an increased risk \nof lymphoma. Dermatitis herpetiformis may be associated. Common presenting features of \ncoeliac disease are: fatigue and weight loss (70%); diarrhoea (70%) — onset of symptoms often \nfollows use of antibiotics; flatulence and bloating (60%); and iron or folate deficiency (70%). \nSerological tests for coeliac disease are now readily available and knowledge of these is \nexpected. Total IgA is included, as IgA deficiency often occurs in coeliac disease. Antigliadin \nantibodies (gliadin is a component of gluten) are useful in monitoring dietary compliance but are \nnot specific. False positive antigliadin antibodies, particularly IgG, can occur with Crohn disease, \npost-infection malabsorption and some autoimmune diseases. \n",

You have just told the doctor about him and the \ndoctor has just examined him. You are feeling guilty that you did not bring the child yesterday, \nand worried about the possibility of some permanent damage to the ear, if you are told that the \nright eardrum is ruptured. You feel that it is your entire fault that this happened and that now his \nhearing will be permanently compromised. \nOpening statement: \n'Should I have brought him yesterday, doctor?' \nQuestions to ask unless already covered: \n• 'Do you think he needs antibiotics?' \n• 'Will it get better on its own?' \n• ‘Is there any other medicine which might help?' \n• 'Will the hole in his ear drum heal?' (Ask if the candidate indicates the drum has \nruptured). \n• 'Will it affect his hearing?' \n• 'Will his hearing be affected permanently?' \n• 'Should he see a specialist?' \nEXPECTATIONS OF CANDIDATE PERFORMANCE \nExplanation of diagnosis \nThe candidate should explain that: \n• The child has acute otitis media which is a common childhood illness, often preceded by a \nviral upper respiratory tract infection. \n• A perforated eardrum complicates a small proportion of cases. \n• The spontaneous drainage of the middle ear after perforation of the ear drum/tympanic \nmembrane leads to relief of pain and resolution of fever. \n• The hole in the tympanic membrane is usually small and heals spontaneously within a few \nweeks in the majority of cases. \n• Most children do not have significant, longterm deficit in hearing, but testing of the hearing \nfollowing healing of the drum could be performed to allay any subsequent concerns. \nImmediate management \nOral antibiotics, preferably amoxycillin in appropriately high dose (90 mg/kg/day). Cefaclor, and \namoxycillin with clavulanate (Augmentin®) are also widely used and would be acceptable. \n",

Decongestants are of no \nestablished benefit in acute otitis media. Acute otitis media will often resolve without the use of \nantibiotics but the presence of a purulent discharge from the right ear and a bulging left eardrum \nwould dictate their use in this case, and a culture of the discharge may be helpful but is not \nobligatory. \nFuture management \n• Arrange to review the child in one week for further examination and in particular inspection of \nthe right eardrum. \n• Specialist referral is not necessary at this stage, but referral to an ENT specialist will be \nrequired if the perforation does not heal spontaneously. \n• Ongoing observation is necessary to ensure that the perforation has healed. \n• Consider hearing check in eight weeks. \nKEY ISSUES  \n• Management of acute otitis media in childhood. \n• Ability to achieve rapport with anxious parent, who is blaming herself as she feels her inaction \nhas compromised her child's hearing permanently. \nCOMMENTARY  \nWhile this scenario addresses otitis media, a common condition in young children, the important \nissue to be addressed as well is the guilt the parent feels (inappropriately) that her inaction has \ncaused her child to be permanently deaf. This is not the case and spontaneous perforation is \nquite common. Reassurance that this can occur in any case of otitis media, and often is beneficial \nin that it relieves symptoms of pain and discomfort immediately should be emphasised. By the \nend of the consultation, these fears of the parent should be allayed by appropriate reassurance. \nPerforation does not necessarily mean major damage to the tympanic membrane, which \ngenerally heals completely without any hearing loss or damage to the middle ear. In this case, \nthere is evidence of significant infection in the other ear and antibiotics are considered \nappropriate in this case. Gentle ear toilet with cotton buds to remove excess discharge is all that \nis necessary for the right ear and antibiotic drops are not necessary. The parent should be \ncautioned about vigorous cleansing of the external canal. \nMost cases of otitis media in young children have a viral aetiology and antibiotic therapy is \nusually unnecessary. Otitis media is usually part of a generalised upper respiratory tract \ninfection. \nWhile the condition usually resolves completely without any sequelae, it is appropriate to review \nfor any complications and to arrange for a hearing test, especially if the parents feel that his \nhearing does not seem normal following the illness. They should be counselled to present him \nagain if this is the case \nIf antibiotics are to be used, it is important to ensure that an appropriate drug is used in adequate \ndosage. \n",

      "text": "137 (T13) \nPerformance Guidelines \n719 \nEXPECTATIONS OF CANDIDATE PERFORMANCE \nThe ultrasound film shows a simple benign small breast cyst. The result of the fine needle \naspiration cytology (FNAC), as shown in the report, clearly indicates there are no malignant cells \nseen. The pathology is most likely a benign breast cyst with no relevance to her future risks of \nbreast cancer. The pathology report shows benign ductal cells and macrophages only consistent \nwith a breast cyst. \nIf the candidate believes the lesion could be a malignancy and wishes a mammogram to be \nperformed, this would be inappropriate care at this young age and should be marked accordingly. \nThe candidate needs to inform the patient clearly of the diagnosis and the management reguired \nnow. This should be along the following lines: \n• Diagnosis — benign cyst, no future cancer risks on this account. \n• Management — observation and periodic review (perhaps referral to specialist breast surgeon \nfor further reassurance). \n• The candidate should then address the concerns raised by the patient in the questions she \nhas asked. \n• 'Can a cyst like this turn into cancer?' (No). \n• 'Should I have an operation?' (Unnecessary, unless a recurrent cyst occurs not responsive \nto repeat aspiration). \n• 'What causes a cyst to come?' (Produced by the breast cells which respond abnormally to \nthe hormones of the menstrual cycle). \n• 'Should I stop the OCP?' (No). \n• 'Does mum having a breast cancer mean that I'm going to get one too?' (No, but you \nare at a slightly increased risk because of the family history). \n• 'How often do you want to see me, and what tests should I have?' (Unless you develop \na lump [and you should do breast self-examination each month after your period has finished] \nyou should see me once a year. When you reach the age of about 35 years we will start yearly \nmammograms. Otherwise ultrasounds may be necessary depending on what is found on \nexamination). \n• 'What about my sister— does she need tests too?'(She needs to be managed the same \nas you). \nKEY ISSUES \n• Ability to interpret the imaging to make a correct diagnosis of a breast cyst, almost certainly \nbenign. \n• Ability to communicate, in appropriate language, the investigation findings of ultrasound and \nFNAC, and their interpretation and significance. \n• Discussion on future followup and need for screening. \nCRITICAL ERRORS  \n• Failure to adequately counsel the patient about fibrocystic change and breast cancer risks. \n• Recommending mammography in a patient of this age. \n",

      "text": "720 \n137 (T13) \nPerformance Guidelines \n \n \n \nCOMMENTARY \nFibrocystic change of the breast is a common finding in women during the reproductive period. \nAlthough less common after the menopause, breast cysts can occur at any age. Most are not \nclinically apparent or relevant; they can show a cyclical pattern and are frequently seen as \nincidental findings on screening mammography as focal rounded discrete parenchymal nodules \nwhich often measure only a few millimetres in diameter. The diagnosis and the benign nature of \nthe nodules can be confirmed by ultrasound if required. In some instances a breast cyst can \npresent clinically as a well-defined palpable discrete ump with a smooth outline. In \npremenopausal and younger women, such cysts are a common cause of patients presenting with \na breast lump. The cysts are lined by a simple epithelial layer. The fluid varies in colour from \nserous yellow though shades of turbid green and brown ('dishwater' appearance). \nCytological examination shows no evidence of malignancy and usually consists of debris and \nmacrophages mixed with normal parenchymal cells. Breast cysts have no demonstrated \nassociation with cancer and are not precancerous. \nNonpalpable breast cysts discovered incidentally usually require no active treatment other than \nreassurance. Aspiration is used only when exclusion of cancer is a concern in view of family \nhistory or patient anxiety. \nBreast cysts presenting clinically as dominant palpable lumps are treated by percutaneous \naspiration. If typical fluid is obtained with disappearance of the lump, and with no recurrence on \nfollowup, no further treatment is required. Surgery is reserved for those complex cysts with a \nbloody aspiration fluid or with suspicious findings on cytology or with a residual lump despite \naspiration, or with equivocal imaging findings. \n",

It gets worse at night.' \nRespond to the doctor as follows, without prompting: \nAbout six weeks ago you felt these funny feelings in your right hand and also a pain in part of your \narm (indicate lateral aspect of right forearm). You asked a pharmacist about it and he suggested \nsome tablets (Nurofen® [ibuprofen]) but they have not helped. In fact you think they may have \nmade it worse. \nIn response to appropriate questioning \n• By 'funny feeling' you mean 'pins and needles' sensation with a feeling of numbness and \ntingling. \n• Only the thumb, index, middle and part of the ring finger are affected. Most marked in the \npulps of the digits (patients are often unaware of the absence of pain in the little finger and \nknowledgeable candidates will seek this information by direct questioning). \n• The feeling is lessened by vigorous shaking of your hand (which you have done especially at \nnight) \n• It is not present all the time. Occurs occasionally during the day (especially after use of the \nhand, such as gardening at the weekend). \n• Has woken you during the night on three or four occasions over the last week. \n• The symptoms are getting worse and you are now describing the feeling as painful tingling. \n• You keep in excellent health and rarely seek medical advice (except for routine Pap smears). \nYou are not on any other medication than ibuprofen (Nurofen®). \n• Personal details, family history and past medical history — respond as for yourself, except for \noccupation (schoolteacher). \nThe doctor may test for sensation (by pinprick or cotton wool). When this is done, you should \nstate that the sensation over the thumb, index, middle and ring fingers of your right hand is \nreduced and you can only just feel the pin (in comparison sensation in all the fingers of the left \nhand and the right little and ring finger are normal). You will be told by the examiner how to \nrespond to other tests done by the candidate (Tinel and Phalen signs). \n",

Others include the \ncommon peroneal nerve, the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh, the obturator nerve, the \nposterior tibial nerve and the sciatic nerve and plantar digital nerves (Morton metatarsalgia). \nThey can result from direct axonal compression, be secondary to vascular problems, or result \nfrom fluid retention as occurs with the use of NSAID or during pregnancy. The common factor is \nincreased pressure on a small segment of the nerve where it passes through a narrow space \nsurrounded by rigid structures. \nPain is often worse at night, perhaps because nocturnal fluid retention increases pressure on the \nnerve. \nSpontaneous resolution occurs with some entrapments though less commonly with carpal tunnel \nsyndrome, apart from when occurring in pregnancy. Nerve conduction studies are diagnostic but \nare only necessary when the diagnosis is in doubt. Wrist splinting at night usually gives \nsymptomatic relief and is the preferred initial treatment. It should be stressed that the diagnosis \ndepends on the classical clinical features. Testing the power of palmar abduction by abductor \npollicis brevis is helpful.

      "text": "140 (T16) \nPerformance Guidelines \n730 \nCOMMENTARY    \nAppendicitis is common: one in seven individuals in Australia will develop the condition. For most \nsufferers, the diagnosis will be readily evident on clinical grounds and they will proceed through \nan uncomplicated appendicectomy. Appendicitis can occur at any age and has its greatest \nmorbidity amongst the very young and the very old. In the former group, the diagnosis is difficult \nto make and is often made late, and in the latter group, comorbidities compound the acute \nabdominal problem. The natural history of appendicitis is that the disease will progress to \nperforation if untreated in 30% of cases. The remainder will resolve after a bout of acute \ninflammation. The practical problem facing the clinician is deciding which patients will proceed to \nperforation — and this is not possible to predict with any degree of certainty. In other words, once \na confident diagnosis of appendicitis has been made, the patient should be advised to undergo \nappendicectomy. \nIf the clinician has a high index of suspicion of appendicitis on clinical grounds, there is little need \nfor any investigation. It the diagnosis is in doubt, or there are other important conditions to \nexclude (e.g. ectopic pregnancy), it may be prudent to investigate further. A white cell count is \noccasionally helpful. A pregnancy test may be appropriate and in some circumstances imaging \nmay be indicated. Ultrasound and computed tomography are fallible and should only be \ninterpreted in context with the clinical condition. \nOnce a decision has been made that the patient should proceed to appendicectomy, informed \nconsent must be obtained. This involves explaining the nature of the proposed treatment to the \npatient. This is best done by prefacing the discussion with an explanation of the natural history of \nappendicitis. The explanation must be given in plain language and the patient given the \nopportunity to ask any questions that she might have. Any potential side effects and \ncomplications of the procedure must be described. The patient with appendicitis should be \nreassured that for most patients the procedure is uneventful and normal activities will be resumed \nwithin a week or two of leaving hospital. Appendicectomy may be performed either by open \noperation or laparoscopy, the choice usually resting with the surgeon's preference and \nsometimes the patient's wishes. The laparoscopic approach is favoured by most surgeons for \nmost patients, but in the long term, there is little difference in outcome between the two \nprocedures. The laparoscopic approach will allow a better view of the abdominal cavity and this \ncan be advantageous where there is a degree of diagnostic doubt — such as in young women of \nchildbearing age. \nThe risks to be discussed include those related to the anaesthetic, laparoscopy and surgery. The \nrisks include infection (chest, wound, intra-abdominal), perforation of aviscus and venous \nthromboembolism. In a young, fit individual, such as the woman in this case, the risks must be put \nin perspective and the patient reassured that the chances of complications are low. The risks will \nbe reduced by the use of prophylactic antibiotics, calf compression devices and early \nmobilisation. Most patients will be mobile the day after the procedure, and home once gut \nfunction has returned. \n",

The median cubital and basilic veins at the elbow are prominent and readily accessible, \nbut are much less desirable choices because of the very occasional (but real), risk of inadvertent \nneedling (or even worse, of infusing) the underlying brachial artery or median nerve. \nOnce the site is selected, the veins should, if necessary, be rendered more prominent by \nwarming or by application of a venous tourniquet. The desired equipment is selected, the skin \nprepared by application of an alcohol wipe to deal with vegetative skin organisms, and \nneedle/cannula insertion performed wearing gloves and using a suitable technique. \nIntradermal injection of a bleb of local anaesthesia (1% Xylocaine) is optional.

The symptoms have been worse in bed at night when \nrecumbent and you have occasionally had regurgitation of bitter fluid into your mouth and bouts \nof dry coughing. You get some relief by drinking a glass of milk or taking a dose of Mylanta® \n(aluminium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide). \nYou are otherwise well and have no other symptoms. You are overweight. The doctor arranged \nfor endoscopic examination of your gullet and stomach (as a day patient) and you have returned \nto find out more about treatment. \nYou have also had a breath test for a possible infection in your stomach which was negative. The \nspecialist told you that he found a hiatus hernia, reflux and inflammation which has caused the \npain but nothing more serious. Your personal details, which are known to the doctor, are as \nfollows: You are married with an 8-year-old daughter. You smoke 15 cigarettes per day. You \ndrink on weekends. Occasionally you have a little too much (beer) with mild intoxication \nYour father died of pancreatic cancer aged 61 years. You have no history of serious illnesses or \noperations. You have mild migraine three or four times a year for which you take aspirin. You \nwere an active sportsman but not now. You still go to the football. Gardening is your other main \nactivity. \nYou should listen carefully to the doctor's explanation but interrupt if there are confusing \nstatements or if inappropriate medical jargon is used. Your main concern is to get rid of your \nsymptoms. You have not been concerned about a serious cause for your symptoms, until now. \nDisplay some anxiety if there is emphasis on the most serious complications (malignant change, \noesophageal stricture or rupture). If the doctor starts to discuss alternative treatments for your \nmigraine in any detail, indicate that this is not a significant problem and that you will be able to \ncope without aspirin. If the doctor's approach is satisfactory from your point of view, then agree to \nfollow the advice about behavioural change. Otherwise be resistant to the doctor's advice about \nweight, smoking and alcohol use. \n",

      "text": "142 (R2) \nPerformance Guidelines \n \nKEY ISSUES \n• \nApproach to patient — ability to achieve compliance by explanation and support. \n• \nInterpretation of investigations — symptoms are caused by the reflux, not the hiatus hernia per se. \n• \nInitial management plan — use of proton pump inhibitor. \n• \nPatient counselling and education — nature of reflux and future course. \nCRITICAL ERROR \n• Failure to prescribe treatment which will reduce gastric acid secretion. \n \nCOMMENTARY \nGastro-oesophageal reflux is common and most people will experience 'heartburn' and regurgitation \nat some time. For most individuals these episodes are a physiological event and do not warrant \ntherapy or investigations. For those who get frequent reflux, over-the-counter medications (antacids \nor H2-receptor antagonists) may be all that is required in terms of management. If the patient has \nsymptoms of such severity that medical advice has been sought, then a decision must be made on \nwhether any investigations are required. If there are obvious precipitating factors such as obesity, \nalcohol or cigarette abuse, then advice on lifestyle matters and empirical therapy (a proton-pump \ninhibitor or H2-receptor antagonist) may be all that is required. \nFor individuals with persistent symptoms, or symptoms resistant to therapy or those with 'alarm' \nsymptoms, investigations need to be considered. Alarm symptoms include dysphagia, haematemesis \nand weight loss. The preferable investigation is endoscopy, which will allow a thorough inspection of \nthe mucosal aspect of the upper digestive tract and biopsy of any suspicious lesion. If the patient's \nproblem is thought to be related to an oesophageal hiatus hernia, a contrast study may provide \nadditional information. In large, complex hernias (para-oesophageal), a contrast study may be more \nhelpful than endoscopic examination. \nThe finding of a 'hiatus hernia' per se does not equate with symptomatic reflux and it is probable that \nmost hiatus hernias do not cause symptoms. Similarly, many patients with symptomatic and \ndemonstrable reflux do not have any anatomical defect at the hiatus. \nFrequently, patients will present with a clear history of gastro-oesophageal reflux, yet have no \nabnormalities on endoscopy. These patients may need to have their pH profile studied. This is the \ngold standard of measurement in reflux disease. A fine bore probe is introduced into the lower \noesophagus and the patient encouraged to go about usual activities over the next 24 hours. The pH \nprobe is attached to a constant monitoring device and the patient is asked to document any episodes \nof 'reflux' that occur during the study. This allows subsequent correlation of symptoms with episodes \nof reduction of pH in the lower oesophagus. A total fall in pH to below 4.0 for more than 4% of the 24 \nhours is considered pathological. A pH study is usually combined with manometric assessment. This \nwill document the peristaltic activity of the oesophagus, the lower oesophageal sphincter pressure \nand function, and the pattern and rate of clearance of acid from the oesophagus. \n746 \n",

Perhaps 10% of individuals with reflux will have some \nform of mucosal abnormality detected at endoscopy. If there is a columnar-lined epithelium, this \nmust be carefully documented in terms of the extent of the abnormal epithelium and any \nhistological changes present. Any dysplastic changes must be documented and the degree of \nsurveillance tailored to the severity of the dysplasia. High grade dysplasia can merge into in-situ \ncarcinoma and these individuals require close monitoring and surgical consultation. \nUncomplicated Barrett oesophagus with no metaplastic mucosal changes needs no more than \nbiennial endoscopic examination \nFor longterm management of symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux, a 'step-down therapy is \nfrequently recommended. Many patients may require a proton-pump inhibitor to gain control of \ntheir symptoms, but this therapy does not necessarily need to be maintained and therapy can \noften be stepped-down after a few weeks to a lower dose of the medication or a change to an \nH2-receptor antagonist. Likewise, if the step-down approach results in symptoms reappearing, \nthe medications can be modified in type or dosage. \nFew individuals with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease need to be considered for surgery. \nThose that do include patients whose symptoms are resistant to medical therapy, those who \nhave troublesome side effects from the medications (e.g. diarrhoea), those with large anatomical \ndefects (a para-oesophageal hernia), those with complications (ulceration or stricture formation) \nand those who do so for personal choice. Regurgitation (with or without respiratory \ncomplications) is a frequent indication for fundoplication, as medical therapy offers little help in \nthe presence of gross reflux. At one stage it was thought that successful surgery would help with \nthe regression of abnormal epithelium in Barrett oesophagus, but such regression rarely occurs \nwith either medical or surgical therapy. As with any procedure, patients contemplating surgery for \ngastro-oesophageal reflux disease need to be fully conversant with the side effects and potential \ncomplications. The side effects include bloating, early satiety and a reduced ability to belch or \nburp. \n",

This has \ncaused him to have the spontaneous bruising you have noticed. He may or may not need active \ntreatment which will be explained to you by the doctor. \nYou are a very anxious parent — and are worried about Robert possibly having leukaemia. \nRobert has been a very well child and seems well now except for the bruising.

In a further 10 to 15%, remission occurs in up to six \nmonths. About 10% of children develop chronic thrombocytopenia, which maybe helped by \nsplenectomy (in over 90% of these children).

If ketones are present, admission for intravenous rehydration is usually required. If \nthe candidate indicates the need for such ketone testing, advise that this was strongly positive. \nAs the ketone test was strongly positive, admission is required. \n• Although hyperemesis gravidarum can be a complication of a normal pregnancy, it occurs with \nincreased frequency in association with multiple pregnancies, hydatidiform mole, and in \nassociation with urinary tract infections. Ultrasound examination is therefore required to rule \nout the former diagnoses, and a midstream urine specimen should be collected and subjected \nto culture to rule out a urinary infection. \n• Treatment in hospital consists of rehydration with saline solutions and additional dextrose, \nusually with vitamin B supplementation. Pyridoxine, or antiemetic therapy with Maxolon® or \nStemetil® can also be used in an attempt to resolve the vomiting. \n• Investigations such as assessment of the serum electrolytes and urea, and liver function tests \nshould be performed to assess the degree of effect of the vomiting on the maternal bodily \nfunction. \n• Usually the hyperemesis settles spontaneously, often having reached a maximum at about 70 \ndays (ten weeks) of pregnancy, and by the time of 100 days (14 weeks) most of the symptoms \nwill have resolved. \n• If nausea and vomiting do not settle satisfactorily, or following initial therapy, other causes \nsuch as small bowel obstruction, cerebral tumour or Addison disease need to be excluded. \n• As she is 38 years old, and is therefore at increased risk of a chromosomal abnormality of the \nbaby, genetic counselling should be arranged with advice given concerning the usefulness of \nthe quadruple maternal serum screening and nuchal fold thickness assessed by ultrasound \nexamination (screening procedures only) or the use of chorion villus biopsy (CVB) or \namniocentesis to assess the fetal karyotype and actually rule out Down Syndrome. As she has \nindicated this diagnosis needs to be ruled out, the definitive tests of CVB or amniocentesis \nshould be advised following advice to her concerning the potential complication rates of each \nof these procedures (risk of abortion due to the procedure is 0.5% for amniocentesis at 15-16 \nweeks, and about 1.5% for CVB at 11-12 weeks). \n \nKEY ISSUES \n• Ability to investigate and treat a woman with hyperemesis gravidarum. \n• Recognition of the need for genetic counselling in view of advanced maternal age. \n \nCRITICAL ERRORS \n• Failure to recognise the need for hospitalisation. \n• Failure to do ultrasound and urine examination to check pregnancy, diagnose twins, molar \npregnancy, urinary infection, and the presence of urinary ketones. \n",

Abnormal results indicate the need for further neuropsychiatry/ \nneuropsychological and medical evaluation to make an exact diagnosis. \nThe cognitive performance deficits as scripted are in (2) Registration and (4) Recall —these are \nshort-term memory functions; the deficits are almost certainly due to acquired brain injury from \nchronic alcohol abuse. The cognitive deficits are confined to short-term memory functions. It is \nvery relevant that all other responses are correct, and that there are no indications with this \nscreening tool of a diffuse chronic brain syndrome/dementia of whatever kind, or an acute brain \nsyndrome/delirium/acute confusional state. In particular this patient is fully oriented and alert, and \nhence he does not have an acute brain syndrome/concentration deficit in answering the doctor's \nquestions; the candidate is expected to know this. \nThis short-term memory deficit picture, with preservation of longterm memory and other \nintellectual function, in the absence of an acute brain syndrome, is a focal cognitive impairment of \nan amnestic (Greek — without memory) type, and is one type of the cognitive decline found with \nchronic alcohol abuse.

      "text": "147 (R7) \nPerformance Guidelines \n762 \n \nCOMMENTARY \nHepatitis A is a major public health concern worldwide. Transmission is largely by the faecal-oral \nroute but food and waterborne outbreaks occur commonly. Incubation is 2 to 6 weeks. Infectivity \nis greatest just before the onset of jaundice when faecal excretion of virus is at its peak. A high \nproportion of patients have subclinical infections. Symptoms of hepatitis A are nonspecific — \nmalaise, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, low-grade fever and right upper quadrant pain. Patients \nmay notice the onset of dark urine and accompanying jaundice in the icteric phase. \nHepatitis B and C also occur in Australia and are endemic in South East Asia. The transmission \nof these is via parenteral and sexual modes. They have a longer incubation period (1-6 months). \nAcute infections with these are largely asymptomatic and presentations are almost always in the \nchronic phase or with serological testing of at-risk ndividuals. \nA number of other viruses, such as EBV, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex may also cause \nacute hepatitis, usually in the context of a systemic illness. \nLiver function tests and hepatitis serology are required to evaluate acute hepatitis. The definitive \nlaboratory test of acute hepatitis A is serum hepatitis A viral immunoglobulin (HAV IgM). The \nurgency of evaluation of hepatitis and consideration for hospital admission depend on the \nfunctional status of the patient, the extent of hepatic dysfunction, the changes in liver enzymes \nand evidence of hepatic synthetic dysfunction (encephalopathy, prolonged INR). \nIn this patient management at home is likely, with attention to the principles of rest, good \nhydration, alcohol and potential hepatotoxin (e.g. paracetamol) avoidance, with further \nmonitoring of liver function. Advice about how to avoid faecal-oral transmission to others and \noffer of immunoglobulin therapy should be discussed. The issue of travel health should be raised \nwith the patient for educational purposes. \n",

      "text": "Interactive Clinical Assessment — Other \nMethods and OSCE Modifications \n \nPeter G Devitt and Heather G Alexander \nThere are nine and sixty ways of constructing tribal lays, and every single one of them is right' \nRudyard Kipling (1865-1936) \nThe aim of any clinical assessment process is to test and measure clinical competence. Ideally, \nthe tool used should be able to sample widely, be objective and capable of assessing applied \nknowledge, attitudes and the skills of history-taking, physical examination, together with the \ninterpretation and synthesis of clinical data. \nThe long and short cases \nThe proponents of the long case would argue that this format meets all the requirements of a test \nof clinical competence and allows the assessment of the whole interaction of the student and the \npatient in a real world setting. Done well, the long case allows the examiner to assess the \ncandidate's interaction with a patient, the ability to communicate, take an appropriate history, \nperform a thorough, yet efficient examination in a professional manner, integrate the information \nobtained to arrive at an appropriate diagnosis and conclude the process with a discourse on the \nproblems and how the condition should be managed. \nLong cases and viva voce examinations have been used for many years to assess clinical \ncompetence, but for educational and logistic reasons, many medical schools and examining \nbodies have moved away from these methods in recent years. Too often the long case is prone to \nthe biases of observer error, a lack of standardisation, but most importantly, a small sample size. \nDoctors and students perform differently on different cases and so the sample size of one in a \nlong case leads to low reliability. Even when combined with short cases, the range of material in \nsuch an examination is limited. The short cases are designed to supplement the long case and \nensure that the candidate is examined on a variety of clinical material. In most instances the \nnumber of cases is relatively small, and this risks reducing the examination process to a lottery. If \nthe candidate is completely unfamiliar with one of the cases, the candidate may fail the \nassessment. Attempts have been made to improve the long case through the use of observed \nlong cases and through more structured approaches to unobserved cases, for example, the \nobjective structured iong examination record (OSLER).1 Logistic reasons have also influenced \nthe move away from using long cases. It is difficult to find suitable patients and sufficient \nexaminers to allow this sort of testing to be done on a broader range of cases and for a large \nnumber of candidates; and most medical schools have now moved to alternative formats. \nThe viva voce \nThe viva voce has a limited role in clinical assessment. It is mainly a test of knowledge and \napplication of knowledge, but can also be used to make a measure of some of the other \ningredients of clinical competence such as ethical values, honesty and tolerance of ambiguity. \nThe viva voce is subject to the same weaknesses as the long and short case process, including \nlow reliability and subjective bias. With the development of the objective structured clinical \nexamination (OSCE), the viva voce has lost popularity as an examination tool, particularly at the \nundergraduate level. It still has a role in critical evaluation. Whilst the viva is subjective and \nvariable, it is these characteristics that make it a favoured format in certain situations. These \ninclude the assessment of individuals being considered for \n1 Val Wass, Van der Vleuten C. The long case. Medical Education 2004, 38: 1176 1180 \n767 \n",

The viva gives the \nexaminer the ability to probe and explore, looking for candidate's strengths and weaknesses and \nit provides the candidate with the opportunity to more fully explain, discuss or justify an issue. \nThe objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) \nThe development and use of a multistation, objective and structured assessment process was \nreported by Harden in 1979.\n2 Since then, the OSCE has taken off as probably the most popular \nform of assessment of clinical medicine. It is used mainly by medical schools, but specialist \ncolleges and other postgraduate bodies are slowly moving from the long and short case \nscenarios to some type of OSCE format. Provided that a sufficient number of stations are used, \nthe OSCE can be used to sample a broad range of clinical scenarios and be a reliable and valid \nexamination process. Most OSCE contain between 15-20 stations and each station may be 5-10 \nminutes. Stations can be designed to test a range of clinical skills, including psycho-motor, \nproblem-solving, and attitudinal and communication skills. It has been suggested that to be \nsuitably reliable and valid an OSCE should contain at least 150 minutes of examination time.\n3,4,5,6 \nThe OSCE marking system -assuming that the examiners adhere to it — ensures objectivity and \nreproducibility. The reliability of the process can be increased if two examiners are used for each \nstation. \nFormal comparisons of the OSCE with other formats, such as the viva voce, show that whereas \nthe OSCE appears to be a fair reflection of overall student performance throughout the course, \nthe viva voce correlates poorly. \nMost forms of clinical assessment provide little in the way of feedback to the teachers and \nassessors. The OSCE can be used to provide such information and a well constructed station \nwith a proven pedigree can be used to identify areas of weakness in student learning or \nunderstanding or misconceptions that may exist. \nThe OSCE has attracted criticism in that its rigid structure does not allow adequate discernment \nof student performance. This is largely a reflection on the system of marking according to a check \nlist. A check list may not take into account the logic and cohesion with which the task is \nperformed, but rather reward the candidate for completion of that task, no matter how random \nand disorganised. This problem can be overcome by global marking\n7'\n8, which moves beyond the \nmere identification of tasks and allows the examiner to mark the candidate for the skill, ability and \ncoordinated approach with which these tasks are approached. While global marking does \nintroduce subjectivity back into the assessment, the guidance of the examiner to the domains to \nbe assessed has produced a necessary refinement into the OSCE format. \n2 Harden RM, Gleeson FA.

The \noriginal CEX suffered from similar disadvantages to the long case in that a limited number of \ncases was examined. The miniCEX has modified the CEX by having examiners observe several \n15-20 minute interactions throughout the year in different clinical settings. The examiner records \naspects of the case, including complexity, and whether the focus of the interaction was \ndata-gathering, diagnosis, treatment or counselling. The candidates are then scored on a 9-point \nscale for interviewing, physical examination, professionalism, clinical judgement, counselling, \norganisation and efficiency, and overall competence. The miniCEX has been shown to be reliable \nand evidence of its ability to discriminate between different levels of performance supports is \nvalidity. The miniCEX offers a method to evaluate residents' clinical skills through direct \nobservation with real patients across multiple patients and settings. \nIn the current age of transparency of process, coupled with increasing legal challenges, it is even \nmore important that assessment bodies are able to justify their \ndecisionmaking, particularly in regard to high-stakes examinations. \nExamining bodies are increasingly adopting assessment methods that \ninclude a broader range of clinical cases, using standardised \nrole-playing or real patients. No matter what examination format is used, \nusers must justify it in terms of validity, relevance, appropriate \nstandards, scope and objectivity.9 \nIn University Clinical Schools, much teaching and much continuous \nassessment is done throughout the course during clinical ward rounds \nand office consultations in an outpatient or emergency department or \ncommunity attachment and as apprentice internship during the latter \nyears of the course. With more extended discussions and presentations \nthe MCAT format can be presented as several sequential MCAT \nassessing history-taking, examination, diagnostic and management \nplans, patient counselling, etc. \nExamples of typical clinical problems expressed as questioning and \ndiscussions on ward rounds follow as further examples of assessment \n— these scenarios can be modified to suit the MCAT formatting. \nThe aim of any clinical \nassessment process \nis to test and measure \nclinical competence. \nIdeally, the tool used \nshould be able to \nsample widely, be \nobjective and capable \nof assessing applied \nknowledge, attitudes \nand the skills of \nhistory-taking, \nphysical examination, \ntogether with the \ninterpretation and \nsynthesis of clinical \n9 Holmboe ES, Huot S, Chung J, Norcini J, Hawkins RE.

This may involve \na degree of physical restraint whilst you assess the situation and obtain a history and examine him. You are unable to \nobtain a history as he is irrational and does not respond coherently to questions. \nBefore you examine the patient, it would be prudent to ensure that intravenous access has been established and that \nhe is on a high flow oxygen mask. Institute pulse oximetry if available. At the same time as you insert an intravenous \ncannula, collect blood samples for routine haematological and biochemical screens. In addition, collect samples for \nblood sugar estimation, and blood culture, especially if he is febrile \nAt this stage you should look at the case notes and the nursing observations charts. In particular, you should note: \n• Any recent change in the vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate and temperature). \n• Fluid balance. \n• Recent drug administration (e.g. opiates, hypnotics). \n• Details of the recent surgical procedure. \n• Past medical history (e.g. problems related to diabetes or cardiovascular disease). \n• Drug use (including alcohol). \n• Comments in the medical and nursing record (e.g. sleep patterns, any abnormal behaviour). \n~ Any abnormal laboratory investigations (e.g. anaemia, macrocytosis, abnormal liver function). \nOnce you have obtained as much information as possible from the case notes, nursing record, patient, relatives and \npersonnel involved in the immediate care of the patient, you are in a position to undertake a physical examination. \nHow will you focus your physical examination? \nTalk to the patient, reassure him and try to establish whether he is oriented and aware of what is going on. He is clearly \nquite disorientated. Undertake the following: \n• Check the vital signs of pulse rate and rhythm, respiratory rate, temperature and blood pressure. \n• Examine the cardiorespiratory systems. \n• Look for evidence of sepsis (chest, wound). \n• Look for evidence of venous thromboembolism (legs, chest). \n• Look for any neurological deficits. \nWhen you have completed your physical examination you can discuss the situation with the nursing staff and family \nmembers and formulate a management plan. \nIt is difficult to take a history or to examine the patient as he is agitated and insisting that he be allowed up to go to the \ntoilet. He spends much of the time sitting on the edge of the bed. \n",

Arrange arterial blood gas analysis (by this stage \nthe patient should be attached to a pulse oximeter), chest X-ray and ECG (possible pulmonary embolus). \n• Hypotension: measure vital signs. \n• Sepsis: investigations should include: white cell count, urinalysis, chest X-ray and blood cultures. \n• Metabolic abnormalities: serum electrolytes; blood sugar estimation; arterial pH. \n• Cardiac disease: ECG to exclude myocardial ischaemia/infarction, arrhythmias. \n• Cerebrovascular event; neurological examination. \n• Pain: look at medication chart and nursing notes. \n• Opiate overdose or effect of other drugs: look at medication chart. Cease any potentially contributing medications. \n• Drug withdrawal, including alcohol, benzodiapines and narcotics: seek information from family and friends. \n• Exacerbation of pre-existing medical conditions: for example dementia, hypothyroidism — check past and recent \nhistory, arrange blood tests (thyroid function tests — TFTs). \nThe patient becomes quieter in response to intravenous fluids and oxygen by face mask. \nHow would you now counsel the family? \nYou need to reassure the family that: \n• The situation is under control. \n• Your investigations may yield a cause for the confusion. \n• There could be a multitude of factors contributing to the patient's delirium. \n• Alcohol withdrawal is a common cause of post-operative confusion and should be easily controlled and the \nproblem self-limiting. \n• You will return to review the patient progressively, particularly when the results of the investigations are through. \n",

However, it is important to exclude other important \ncauses of postoperative pyrexia. These include: \n• \nPre-existing problems (e.g. chest infection, immobility — deep venous thrombosis [DVT]). \n• \nSepsis or some other complication (concealed haemorrhage, bile leak) at the surgical site (operative bed, wound \ndrains, wounds). \n• \nSepsis at other sites (urinary tract). \n• \nIntravenous cannula site (thrombophlebitis causing fever from intravenous cannulae and infusions is usually \ninflammatory and irritative rather than infective; treatment is to remove the offending cannula). \n• \nDrug reaction (check the charts). \n• \nFebrile blood transfusion reaction (unlikely in the present circumstances of elective uncomplicated surgery — but \ncheck operation and anaesthetic notes). \nThe questions you will need to ask yourself include: \n• \n‘Is the patient septic?' \n• \n‘Is there evidence of a septic or inflammatory focus?' \nThese two questions will be answered by a careful examination of the patient record, ward observations and the \npatient herself. In this instance, the fever has appeared rapidly after the operation and is most likely an inflammatory \nresponse to partial pulmonary collapse. Pulmonary atelectasis is more likely to occur in the presence of pre-existing \nlung disease, or after major thoracic or abdominal surgery where there has been poor control of pain. Physical signs \nmay include crackles at lung bases or evidence of more significant collapse; but with minor degrees there may be no \nabnormal findings. \nSeptic problems related to the operation itself do not usually declare themselves for several days after the procedure. \nSimilarly, venous thromboembolic complications and urinary infections tend to manifest themselves after a lapse of \nseveral days or in the second postoperative week. The major postoperative complications that give an early spike of \nfever (within the first 24 hours) are inflammatory, rather than infective, and include: \n• \nPulmonary atelectasis (the most common cause), which responds to mechanical measures to improve pulmonary \nventilation and remove inspissated sputum plugs. The major thrust of treatment is active breathing exercises and \nchest physiotherapy (including postural drainage). Antibiotics have little role in the initial treatment, although many \ndoctors prescribe antibiotics concurrently. \n• \nA wound haematoma. \n• \nA bile leak. \n• \nSuperficial chemical thrombophlebitis (cannula site). \n",

AMC assessments follow these aims in MCQ and Clinical \nassessments. \nAUTONOMY \nThe moral right to choose and follow one's own plan of life and action, including the right to refuse treatment. \nBENEFICENCE \nThe moral duty to help persons in need. CAPACITY \nThe patient's ability to understand information relevant to making a decision.

The AMC applies this principle in MCQ and Clinical assessments, while identifying standards of \nminimum basic competencies in each discipline. \nCOMPETENCE \nThis term is frequently used interchangeably with capacity. Strictly speaking, it is a legal term denoting the right to \nmake a decision. The legal presumption is that all adults are competent, and only a judge can rule a person \nincompetent.

These are necessary (but not sufficient) requirements as they will \nbe influenced greatly by the context of the measurement. \nSECURITY/INVIOLABILITY OF THE PERSON \nThe fundamental right of individuals to expect respect for their bodies and persons and nonviolation of their bodies and \npersons, be it through physical, psychological or other means. \nSENSITIVITY \nIn statistical terminology, the true positivity rate of a test in a given population. A highly sensitive test gives a positive \nresult identifying most or all of the patients in the population who have the disease/condition under test. The test may \nalong the way give some falsely positive results if the test is excessively sensitive and thus cross-reactive with other \nconditions than the one under test. \nSOMATISATION \nThe conversion of emotional conflict and stresses into physical symptoms. SPECIFICITY \nThe converse of sensitivity: in statistical terminology — the true negativity rate of a test. Highly specific tests for a given \ndisease/condition will rarely give falsely negative results: so a person testing negative is very unlikely to have the given \ncondition. The two properties of sensitivity and specificity are often inversely related — few tests can combine absolute \nspecificity with absolute sensitivity. \nSTANDARDS \nAssessments separate passers from failures using standards of competence and performance. \nSTATISTICAL METHODS \nThose mathematical or analytical approaches, often referred to as psychometrics, that express the relationships \nbetween quantitatively different stimuli or measures, and then seek to analyse and explain these with reference to the \nattributes being measured. \nSUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT \nAssessment that is primarily intended for administrative purposes, such as progression to the next stage — whence \n'barrier assessment' — or certification of competence. It is used to indicate whether a learner has reached a required \nacceptable level of performance, and thus tends to be only at the end of a period of instruction with minimal feedback \nto a learner. \n",

      "text": "784 \nVALIDITY \nIn short, that a measure of assessment actually measures what it was intended to measure. Differing terms are often \napplied to give more specific meanings; thus face validity or content validity indicates the need for tests to be \nacceptable to the stakeholders, or to appear to measure what they should be measuring. Validity can be improved by \nuse of a matrix or blueprint. Concurrent validity refers to one approach measuring the same attribute as another \napproach, while predictive validity assumes that the measure will predict another behaviour. \nVOLUNTARINESS \nThe patient's right to come to a decision freely, without undue pressure including force, coercion, or manipulation. \nWEIGHTING \nWeighting of the particular components of a global assessment can be applied when there is consensus evidence that \nsome components (e.g. Mastery/Key Issues) are of greater importance than other components. The AMC uses such \nMastery items in MCQ assessments, and has identified Key Issues and Critical Errors in clinical assessments \n",
