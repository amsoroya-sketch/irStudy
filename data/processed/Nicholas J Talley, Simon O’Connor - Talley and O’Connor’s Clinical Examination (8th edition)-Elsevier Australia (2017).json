      "text": "Foreword\nClinical medicine is at its finest when demonstrated \nby the best exponents of the clinical examination. Like \nmost doctors I could name five or so of my teachers \nand colleagues who made the clinical examination both \na true art and finely honed diagnostic tool. They have \nhad my enduring admiration and respect.\nIn the interests of open disclosure, and in order to \nprotect the integrity of Nick Talley and Simon O’Connor, \nI am obliged to point out that I never perfected the \nart of a smooth, seamless, comprehensive physical \nexamination.\nI’m sure examiners could see me, and almost hear \nme, thinking through the cranial nerve examination \nnerve by nerve in much the same way that a novice \ndancer counts out loud the requisite steps while \nprogressing through an uncomplicated routine.\nI read, digested, wrote on and tried to memorise the \nother Talley and O’Connor text Examination Medicine, \nwhich was first published in 1985 and which I used \nfor my clinical examination for my Fellowship in \nEmergency Medicine.\nThe first edition of this book, Clinical Examination, \nwas published in 1988 and is aimed particularly at \nmedical students. Perhaps if they had written this book \na decade earlier when I was a student, as were they, I \nmight have been more accomplished.\nOf course a book alone, however well written, cannot \nconfer proficiency in the art of history taking and \nphysical examination. Only repeated practice, built on \nlogical construction in the art, can achieve that. I suspect \nI could have done much better in my attitude to diligent \npractice but, failing that, Talley and O’Connor were \nextraordinarily helpful to me.\nIt was only in recent years that I met one of the \nauthors, Nick Talley, and I greeted him with almost \nthe same gratitude that a Harry Potter fan would greet \nJ.K. Rowling. It fazed him not one iota. I suspect that \nhe, and Simon O’Connor who, unfortunately, I have \nnot met in spite of my spending five years in Canberra, \nare well used to such a reaction from the doctors they \nhave assisted for the past 30 years.\nThis 8th edition of Clinical Examination has updated, \npeer-reviewed text with recent evidence, new images, \nclinical hints and guidance for OSCE.\nThe writing is clear. The richness and the potential \nof an understanding of a patient gained through the \nclinical examination shines through. The text encourages \nthe reader to think logically about their approach and \nit does not impose a rote learning style. Nevertheless \nthere are many aids throughout to encourage retention \nof what has been learned. Summary chapters, diagrams, \ntables, mnemonics, tips and tests will assist a quick \nrevision.\nGiven my own interest in the art of medicine over \nthe years, I found the chapter on clinical methods: an \nhistorical perspective, illuminating, grounding and \nreassuring. The art of the clinical examination is timeless \nand has not been forgotten by these authors.\nProfessor Chris Baggoley AO, BVSc(Hons), BM BS, \nBSocAdmin, FACEM, FRACMA, D.Univ (Flin)\nEDMS, Southern Adelaide Local Health Network\n",

      "text": "Preface\nAcquire the art of detachment, the virtue of method, \nand the quality of thoroughness, but above all the \ngrace of humility.\nAsk not what disease the person has, but rather what \nperson the disease has.\nSir William Osler\nWelcome to the new edition of Clinical Examination, \nwhich has been carefully revised and updated. Clinical \nskills are the foundation of clinical medicine, most \nimportantly history taking and physical examination. \nIn most cases, a good history and physical examination \nwill lead you to make the correct diagnosis, and this \nis critical—your diagnosis will more often than not \nseal the fate of your patient and, assuming you are \ncorrect, take them down the optimal management path.\nIn order to make a correct diagnosis you need to \nassemble all the facts at hand. Blindly ordering tests in the \nabsence of the clinical history and relevant examination \noften leads to serious errors. It is distressingly common \nfor tests to be ordered and referrals made without an \nadequate history or even a cursory examination of \nthe patient. The wrong diagnosis can cause harm and \ndistress that lasts a lifetime.\nClinical Examination is designed to take students \non an exciting journey from acquiring core skills to \nan advanced level, applying a strong evidence-based \nfocus. We have taken a systematic approach because \nrecognition of all the facts aids accurate diagnosis. The \npatient presenting with, for example, heart disease may \nhave not only objective changes of disease when \nlistening to the heart but also relevant findings in the \nhands, arms, face, abdomen and legs that can guide \nidentification of the underlying disease process and \nprognosis. Diagnosticians are great medical detectives \nwho apply rigorous methodology to uncover the truth, \nsolve a puzzle and commence the healing process.\nOur book is not a traditional undergraduate textbook \nand we are proud of its distinctive features. Learning \nmust be fun! Unlike most other similar textbooks, \nours is deliberately laced with humour and historical \nanecdotes that generations of students have told us \nenhance the learning experience. Another distinguishing \nfeature is that every chapter in this book has undergone \npeer review, just as you would expect would occur for \nany published journal article. We have believed from the \nbeginning that peer review is integral to ensuring the \nhighest possible standards and maximising the value of \na core textbook. In this edition based on the peer review \nprocess we have made revisions, excluded irrelevant \nmaterial and added updates where appropriate. Videos \ndemonstrating techniques enhance the learning \nexperience, and the e-book format supports learning \nfrom a tablet or computer anywhere and anytime. \nWe are also proud of this book being current and as \nevidence based as is possible, with updated chapter \nreferences and annotations so readers can dive deeper \ninto any of the literature that interests them. We want \nstudents at all levels to know there are many limitations \nand gaps (all crying out for more research), and to \nremain curious and excited about medicine as they \nlearn.\nClinical skills can be mastered only by practice and \nyou should aim to see as many cases as you can while \nstudying from this or any book. You will learn from \nyour patients your entire career if only you take the \ntime to listen and observe.\nGreat clinicians are made not born, and everyone \npractising medicine needs to master clinical skills. \nThank you to all those who have provided us with \nexpert input as we have made our revisions. We also \nthank all of our colleagues and patients who educate \nus daily, and the legion of students who have written \nto us, including those who have pointed out omissions \nor mistakes (real or perceived).\nNicholas J. Talley\nSimon O’Connor\nNewcastle and Canberra, July 2017\n",

      "text": "Clinical methods: an historical perspective\nThe best physician is the one who is able to \ndifferentiate the possible and the impossible.\nHerophilus of Alexandria (335–280BC)\nSince classical Greek times interrogation of the patient \nhas been considered most important because disease \nwas, and still is, viewed in terms of the discomfort it \ncauses. However, the current emphasis on the use of \nhistory taking and physical examination for diagnosis \ndeveloped only in the 19th century. Although the terms \n‘symptoms and signs’ have been part of the medical \nvocabulary since the revival of classical medicine, until \nrelatively recently they were used synonymously. During \nthe 19th century, the distinction between symptoms \n(subjective complaints, which the clinician learns from \nthe patient’s account of his or her feelings) and signs \n(objective morbid changes detectable by the clinician) \nevolved. Until the 19th century, diagnosis was empirical \nand based on the classical Greek belief that all disease \nhad a single cause: an imbalance of the four humours \n(yellow bile, black bile, blood and phlegm). Indeed \nthe Royal College of Physicians, founded in London \nin 1518, believed that clinical experience without \nclassical learning was useless, and physicians who were \nCollege members were fined if they ascribed to any \nother view. At the time of Hippocrates (460?–375BC), \nobservation (inspection) and feeling (palpation) had \na place in the examination of patients. The ancient \nGreeks, for example, noticed that patients with jaundice \noften had an enlarged liver that was firm and irregular. \nShaking a patient and listening for a fluid splash was \nalso recognised by the Greeks. Herophilus of Alexandria \n(335–280BC) described a method of taking the pulse \nin the 4th century BC. However, it was Galen of \nPergamum (AD130–200) who established the pulse \nas one of the major physical signs, and it continued \nto have this important role up to the 18th century, \nwith minute variations being recorded. These variations \nwere erroneously considered to indicate changes in \nthe body’s harmony. William Harvey’s (1578–1657) \nstudies of the human circulation, published in 1628, \nhad little effect on the general understanding of the \nvalue of the pulse as a sign. Sanctorius (1561–1636) \nwas the first to time the pulse using a clock, while \nJohn Floyer (1649–1734) invented the pulse watch in \n1707 and made regular observations of the pulse rate. \nAbnormalities in heart rate were described in diabetes \nmellitus in 1776 and in thyrotoxicosis in 1786. Fever was \nstudied by Hippocrates and was originally regarded as \nan entity rather than a sign of disease. The thermoscope \nwas devised by Sanctorius in 1625. In association with \nGabriel Fahrenheit (1686–1736), Hermann Boerhaave \n(1668–1738) introduced the thermometer as a research \ninstrument and this was produced commercially in \nthe middle of the 18th century. In the 13th century \nJohannes Actuarius (d. 1283) used a graduated glass \nto examine the urine. In Harvey’s time a specimen \nof urine was sometimes looked at (inspected) and \neven tasted, and was considered to reveal secrets \nabout the body. Harvey recorded that sugar diabetes \n(mellitus) and dropsy (oedema) could be diagnosed \nin this way. The detection of protein in the urine, \nwhich Frederik Dekkers (1644–1720) first described \nin 1673, was ignored until Richard Bright (1789–1858) \ndemonstrated its importance in renal disease. Although \nCelsus described and valued measurements such as \nweighing and measuring a patient in the 1st century \nAD, these methods became widely used only in the \n20th century. A renaissance in clinical methods began \nwith the concept of Battista Morgagni (1682–1771) that \ndisease was not generalised but rather arose in organs, \na conclusion published in 1761. Leopold Auenbrugger \ninvented chest tapping (percussion) to detect disease \nin the same year. Van Swieten, his teacher, in fact \n",

The technique was \nforgotten for nearly half a century until Jean Corvisart \n(1755–1821) translated Auenbrugger’s work in 1808.\nThe next big step occurred with René Laënnec \n(1781–1826), a student of Corvisart. He invented the \nstethoscope in 1816 (at first merely a roll of stiff paper) \nas an aid to diagnosing heart and lung disease by \nlistening (auscultation). This revolutionised chest \nexamination, partly because it made the chest accessible \nin patients too modest to allow a direct application of \nthe examiner’s ear to the chest wall, as well as allowing \naccurate clinicopathological correlations. William Stokes \n(1804–78) published the first treatise in English on the \nuse of the stethoscope in 1825. Josef Skoda’s (1805–81) \ninvestigations of the value of these clinical methods \nled to their widespread and enthusiastic adoption after \nhe published his results in 1839. These advances helped \nlead to a change in the practice of medicine. Bedside \nteaching was first introduced in the Renaissance by \nMontanus (1498–1552) in Padua in 1543. In the 17th \ncentury, physicians based their opinion on a history \nprovided by an apothecary (assistant) and rarely saw \nthe patients themselves. Thomas Sydenham (1624–89) \nbegan to practise more modern bedside medicine, \nbasing his treatment on experience and not theory, \nbut it was not until a century later that the scientific \nmethod brought a systematic approach to clinical \ndiagnosis.\nThis change began in the hospitals of Paris after the \nFrench Revolution, with recognition of the work of \nMorgagni, Corvisart, Laënnec and others. Influenced by \nthe philosophy of the Enlightenment, which suggested \nthat a rational approach to all problems was possible, the \nParis Clinical School combined physical examination \nwith autopsy as the basis of clinical medicine. The \nmethods of this school were first applied abroad in \nDublin, where Robert Graves (1796–1853) and William \nStokes worked. Later, at Guy’s Hospital in London, \nthe famous trio of Richard Bright, Thomas Addison \n(1793–1860) and Thomas Hodgkin (1798–1866) made \ntheir important contributions. In 1869 Samuel Wilks \n(1824–1911) wrote on the nail changes in disease \nand the signs he described remain important. Carl \nWunderlich’s (1815–77) work changed the concept of \ntemperature from a disease in itself to a symptom of \ndisease. Spectacular advances in physiology, pathology, \npharmacology and the discovery of microbiology in the \nlatter half of the 19th century led to the development \nof the new ‘clinical and laboratory medicine’, which \nis the rapidly advancing medicine of the present day. \nThe modern systematic approach to diagnosis, with \nwhich this book deals, is still, however, based on taking \nthe history and examining the patient by looking \n(inspecting), feeling (palpating), tapping (percussing) \nand listening (auscultating).\nSuggested reading\nBordage G.

SIR WILLIAM OSLER (1849–1919)\nAn extensive knowledge of medical facts is not useful \nunless a doctor is able to extract accurate and succinct \ninformation from a sick person about his or her illness, \nand then synthesise the data. This is how you make \nan accurate diagnosis. In all branches of medicine, the \ndevelopment of a rational plan of management depends \non a correct diagnosis or a sensible, differential diagnosis \n(list of possible diagnoses). Except for patients who \nare extremely ill, taking a careful medical history should \nprecede both examination and treatment.\nTaking the medical history is the first step in \nmaking a diagnosis; it will be used to direct the \nphysical examination and will usually determine what \ninvestigations are appropriate. More often than not, an \naccurate history suggests the correct diagnosis, whereas \nthe physical examination and subsequent investigations \nmerely serve to confirm this impression.1,2 Text box 1.1 \nshows the consultation sequence.\nGreat diagnosticians have been feted by history \nand you will see their names live on in this book: \nHippocrates, Osler, Mayo, Addison and Cushing, \nto name a few. History taking involves more than \nlistening: you must observe actively (a part of physical \nexamination). Noting the discomfort of a patient who \nhas abdominal pain, for example, will influence the \ninterpretation of the history. Remember that the history \nis the least-expensive way of making a diagnosis.\nChanges in medical education mean that much \nstudent teaching is now conducted away from the \ntraditional hospital ward. Students must learn how \nto take a medical history in any and every setting, \nbut obviously adjustments to the technique must be \nmade for patients seen in busy surgeries or outpatient \ndepartments. Much information about a patient’s \nprevious medical history may already be available in \nhospital or clinic records (some regrettably inaccurately \nrecorded, so be on your guard); the detail needed will \nvary depending on the complexity of the presenting \nproblem and on whether the visit is a follow-up or a \nnew consultation.\n The consultation sequence\n1.\t History\n2.\t Examination\n3.\t Explanation to patient of findings, differential \ndiagnosis (possible diagnoses) and \nmanagement plan (further tests and \ntreatment)\n4.\t Ordering of, and explanation of, appropriate \ntests\n5.\t Commencement of treatment, if indicated\nTEXT BOX 1.1\nT&O’C ESSENTIALS\nAll students must have a comprehensive \nunderstanding of how to take a complete medical \nhistory, which is usually essential for accurate \ndiagnosis.\nBEDSIDE MANNER AND \nESTABLISHING RAPPORT\nHistory taking requires practice and depends very much \non the doctor–patient relationship.3 It is important to \nlearn an approach that helps put patients at ease. This \nis often best done by watching the way more senior \ncolleagues work with their patients. Students need to \ndevelop their own methods of feeling easy with their \npatients. Once students learn how to establish this \nrapport with patients, the history taking and indeed \nall of the consultation is likely to be rewarding. \n",

Ask yourself the question ‘How would I like \nto be treated if I were this patient?’\nIt is possible to be understanding and sympathetic \nabout a patient’s illness and circumstances but retain \nobjectivity. Doctors who can become overwhelmed \nby their patients’ problems cannot look after them \nproperly.a\nHospitals and clinics all have rules and suggestions \nfor students about how they should dress and identify \nthemselves, and whose permission they need to see \npatients on wards. Make sure you are familiar with \nthese rather than face ejection from the ward by a \nsenior doctor or (more frightening) nurse.b\nRemember that patients tell doctors and even \nmedical students facts they would tell no one else. It \nis essential that these matters be kept confidential except \nwhen shared for clinical reasons and in accordance \nwith privacy legislation. There should be no problem \nin discussing a patient with a colleague, but unless the \ncolleague is directly involved in the patient’s management \nthe patient should not be identified. This applies to \ndiscussion of patients and their results at clinical \nmeetings. In open meetings, the patient’s name should \nbe removed from displayed tests and documents.\nThere is no doubt that the treatment of a patient \nbegins the moment one reaches the bedside or the \npatient enters the consulting rooms. The patient’s \nfirst impressions of a doctor’s professional manner \nwill have a lasting effect. One of the axioms of the \nmedical profession is primum non nocere (first, do \nno harm).4 An unkind and thoughtless approach to \nquestioning and examining a patient can cause harm \nbefore any treatment has had the opportunity to do so. \nYou should aim to leave the patient feeling better for \nyour visit.\nMuch has been written about the correct way to \ninterview patients, but each doctor has to develop his \nor her own method, guided by experience gained from \nclinical teachers and patients themselves.5–8 To help \nestablish this good relationship, the student or doctor \nb\na\n (a) Interviewing correctly. (b) Interviewing \nincorrectly \nFIGURE 1.1\nmust make a deliberate point of introducing him- or \nherself and explaining his or her role. A student might \nsay: ‘Good afternoon, Mrs Evans. My name is Jane \nSmith. I am Dr Osler’s medical student. She has asked \nme to come and see you.’ A patient seen at a clinic \nshould be asked to come and sit down, and be directed \nto a chair. The door should be shut or, if the patient is \nin the ward, the curtains drawn to provide some privacy. \nThe clinician should sit down beside or near the patient \nso as to be close to eye level and give the impression \nthat the interview will be an unhurried one.9,10\nIt is important here to address the patient respectfully, \nlook at him or her (not the computer) and use his or \nher name and title (see Fig. 1.1). Some general remarks \nabout the weather, hospital food or the crowded waiting \nb\t Many hospitals have banned ties and long sleeves for their staff so as to \nprevent the spread of infection.

Encourage \nthe patient to continue telling you about his or her \nmain problem or problems from the beginning. Then \nask specific questions to fill in all the gaps.\nAt the end of the history and examination, a detailed \nrecord is made. However, many clinicians find it useful \nto make rough notes during the interview. Tell patients \nyou will be doing this but will also be listening to them. \nWith practice, note taking can be done without any \nloss of rapport. Pausing to make a note of a patient’s \nanswer to a question and engaging his or her eyes \ndirectly can help, and indicates that the story is being \ntaken seriously.\nMany clinics and hospitals use computer records, \nwhich may be displayed on a computer screen on the \ndesk. Notes are sometimes added to these during the \ninterview via a keyboard. It can be very off-putting for \na patient when the interviewing doctor looks entirely \nat the computer screen rather than at the patient. With \npractice it is possible to enter data while maintaining \neye contact with a patient, but at first it is probably \npreferable to make written notes and transcribe or \ndictate them later.\nThe final record must be a sequential, accurate \naccount of the development and course of the illness \nor illnesses of the patient (see Ch 50). There are a \nnumber of methods of recording this information. \nHospitals may have printed forms with spaces for \nrecording specific information. This applies especially \nto routine admissions (e.g. for minor surgical \nprocedures). Follow-up consultation questions and \nnotes will be briefer than those of the initial consultation; \nobviously, many questions are relevant only for the \ninitial consultation.

For example, the patient may \nnot have noticed an association between the occurrence \nof chest discomfort and exercise (typical of angina) \nunless asked specifically. It may also be helpful to give \na list of possible answers. A patient with suspected \nangina who is unable to describe the symptom may \nbe asked whether the sensation is sharp, dull, heavy \nor burning. The reply that it is sharp makes angina \nless likely.\nAppropriate (but not exaggerated) reassuring gestures \nare of value to maintain the flow of conversation. If \nthe patient stops giving the story spontaneously, it \ncan be useful to provide a short summary of what \nhas already been said and encourage him or her to \ncontinue.\nThe clinician must learn to listen with an open \nmind.10 The temptation to leap to a diagnostic decision \nbefore the patient has had the chance to describe all \nthe symptoms in his or her own words should be \nresisted. Avoid using pseudo-medical terms and if the \npatient uses them then find out exactly what is meant \nby them, as misinterpretation of medical terms is \ncommon.\nPatients’ descriptions of their symptoms may \nvary as they are subjected to repeated questioning by \nincreasingly senior medical staff. The patient who has \ndescribed his chest pain as sharp and left-sided to the \nmedical student may tell the registrar that the pain is \ndull and in the centre of his chest. These discrepancies \ncome as no surprise to experienced clinicians; they are \nsometimes the result of the patient having had time \nto reflect on his or her symptoms. This does mean, \nhowever, that very important aspects of the story should \nbe checked by asking follow-up questions, such as: ‘Can \nyou show me exactly where the pain is?’ and ‘What do \nyou mean by sharp?’\nSome patients may have medical problems that \nmake the interview difficult for them; these include \ndeafness and problems with speech and memory. These \nmust be recognised by the clinician if the interview is \nto be successful. See Chapter 2 for more details.\nsequence, but the detail required depends on the \ncomplexity of the presenting illness.\nINTRODUCTORY QUESTIONS\nIn order to obtain a thorough history the clinician \nmust establish a good relationship, interview in a \nlogical manner, listen carefully, interrupt appropriately \nand usually only after allowing the patient to tell the \ninitial story, note non-verbal clues and correctly \ninterpret the information obtained.\nThe next step after introducing oneself should be \nto find out the patient’s major symptoms or medical \nproblems. Asking the patient ‘What brought you here \ntoday?’ can be unwise, as it often promotes the reply \n‘an ambulance’ or ‘a car’. This little joke wears thin after \nsome years in clinical practice. It is best to attempt a \nconversational approach and ask the patient ‘What has \nbeen the trouble or problem recently?’ or ‘When were \nyou last quite well?’ or ‘What made you come to the \nhospital (or clinic) today?’ For a follow-up consultation \nsome reference to the last visit is appropriate, for \nexample: ‘How have things been going since I saw you \nlast?’ or ‘It’s been about … weeks since I saw you last, \nisn’t it? What’s been happening since then?’ This lets the \npatient know the clinician hasn’t forgotten him or her.\nSome have suggested that the clinician begin with \nquestions about more general aspects of the patient’s \nlife. There is a danger that this attempt to establish early \nrapport will seem intrusive to a person who has come \nfor help about a specific problem, albeit one related to \nother aspects of life. This type of general and personal \ninformation may be better approached once the clinician \nhas shown an interest in the presenting problem or as \npart of the social history—usually intrusive questions \nshould be deferred to a subsequent consultation when \nthe patient and clinician know each other better. The \nbest approach and timing of this part of the interview \nwill vary, depending on the nature of the presenting \nproblem and the patient’s and clinician’s attitude.\nT&O’C ESSENTIALS\nEncourage patients to tell their story in their own \nwords from the onset of the first symptom to the \npresent time. Find out the full details of each \nproblem and document them.\n",

Your job is to identify them all accurately \nand create a full medical picture of the individual.\nCurrent symptoms\nCertain information should routinely be sought for \neach current symptom if this hasn’t been volunteered \nby the patient. The mnemonic SOCRATES summarises \nthe questions that should be asked about most \nsymptoms:\nS\t ite\nO\tnset\nC\tharacter\nR\t adiation (if the symptom is pain or \ndiscomfort)\nA\tlleviating factors\nT\t iming\nE\t xacerbating factors\nS\t everity.\nSite\nAsk where the symptom is exactly and whether it is \nlocalised or diffuse. Ask the patient to point to the \nactual site on the body.\nSome symptoms are not localised. Patients who \ncomplain of dizziness do not localise this to any \nparticular site—but vertigo may sometimes involve a \nfeeling of movement within the head and to that extent \nis localised. Other symptoms that are not localised \ninclude cough, shortness of breath (dyspnoea) and \nchange in weight.\nOnset (mode of onset and pattern)\nFind out whether the symptom came on rapidly, \ngradually or instantaneously. Some cardiac arrhythmias \nare of instantaneous onset and offset. Sudden loss of \nconsciousness (syncope) with immediate recovery \noccurs with cardiac but not neurological disease. Ask \nwhether the symptom has been present continuously \nor intermittently. Find out whether the symptom is \ngetting worse or better, and, if so, when the change \noccurred. For example, the exertional breathlessness \nof chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may \ncome on with less and less activity as it worsens. Find \nout what the patient was doing at the time the symptom \nPRESENTING (PRINCIPAL) \nSYMPTOM\nNot uncommonly, a patient has many symptoms. An \nattempt must be made to decide which symptom led \nthe patient to present. It must be remembered that the \npatient’s and the doctor’s ideas of what constitutes a \nserious problem may differ. A patient with symptoms \nof a cold who also, in passing, mentions that he has \nrecently coughed up blood (haemoptysis) may need \nmore attention to his chest than to his nose. Find \nout what problem or symptom most concerns the \npatient. Patients are unlikely to be satisfied with their \nconsultation if the issue that troubles them the most \nis not dealt with, even if it is a minor problem for \nwhich reassurance is all that is required. Record each \npresenting symptom or symptoms in the patient’s own \nwords, avoiding technical terms at this stage.\nWhenever you identify a major complaint or \nsymptom, think of the following as you are trying to \nunravel the story and ask questions to try to find out:\n1.\tWhere is the problem? (Probable anatomical \ndiagnosis)\n2.\tWhat is the nature of the symptom? (Likely \npathological diagnosis)\n3.\tHow does it affect the patient? (Physiological and \nfunctional diagnosis)\n4.\tWhy did the patient develop it? (Aetiological \ndiagnosis)\nA diagnosis is not just about a name; you are trying \nto determine the likely disease process so that you can \nadvise the patient of the prognosis and plan management.\nHISTORY OF THE \nPRESENTING ILLNESS\nEach of the presenting problems has to be talked about \nin detail with the patient, but in the first part of the \ninterview the patient should lead the discussion. In \nthe second part the doctor should take more control \nand ask specific questions. When writing down the \nhistory of the presenting illness, the events should be \nplaced in chronological order; this might have to be \ndone later when the whole history has been obtained. \nIf numerous systems are affected, the events should \nbe placed in chronological order for each system. \nRemember, patients may have multiple problems, of \n",

For example, severe breathlessness that wakes \na patient from sleep is very suggestive of cardiac failure.\nCharacter\nHere it is necessary to ask the patient what is meant \nby the symptom, to describe its character. If the patient \ncomplains of dizziness, does this mean the room spins \naround (vertigo) or is it more a feeling of impending \nloss of consciousness? Does indigestion mean abdominal \npain, heartburn, fullness after eating, excess wind or \na change in bowel habit? If there is pain, is it sharp, \ndull, stabbing, boring, burning or cramp-like?\nRadiation of pain or discomfort\nDetermine whether the symptom, if localised, radiates; \nthis mainly applies if the symptom is pain. Certain \npatterns of radiation are typical of a condition or even \ndiagnostic, for example the nerve root distribution of \npain associated with herpes zoster (shingles).\nAlleviating factors\nAsk whether anything makes the symptom better. For \nexample, the pain of pericarditis may be relieved when \na patient sits up, whereas heartburn from acid reflux \nmay be relieved by drinking milk or taking an antacid. \nHave analgesic medications been used to control the \npain? Have narcotics been required?\nTiming\nFind out when the symptom first began and try to date \nthis as accurately as possible. For example, ask the \npatient what the first thing was that he or she noticed \nwas ‘unusual’ or ‘wrong’. Ask whether the patient has \nhad a similar illness in the past. It is often helpful to \nask patients when they last felt entirely well. In a patient \nwith long-standing symptoms, ask why he or she \ndecided to see the doctor at this time.\nExacerbating factors\nAsk whether anything makes the symptom worse. The \nslightest movement may exacerbate the abdominal pain \nof peritonitis or the pain in the big toe caused by gout.\nSeverity\nThis is subjective. The best way to assess severity is to \nask the patient whether the symptom interferes with \nnormal activities or sleep. Severity can be graded from \nmild to very severe. A mild symptom can be ignored \nby the patient, whereas a moderate symptom cannot be \nignored but does not interfere with daily activities. A \nsevere symptom interferes with daily activities, whereas \na very severe symptom markedly interferes with most \nactivities. Alternatively, pain or discomfort can be \ngraded on a 10-point scale from 0 (no discomfort) to \n10 (unbearable). (However, asking patients who are in \nsevere pain to provide a number out of 10 seems at \nbest a distraction and at worst rather unkind.) A face \nscale using pictures of different faces to represent pain \nseverity from no pain (0) to very much pain (10) can \nbe useful in practice.12\nA number of other methods of quantifying pain \nare available (e.g. the visual analogue scale, whereby \nthe patient is asked to mark the severity of pain on a \n10-centimetre horizontal line). Note that all of these \nscales are more useful for comparing the subjective \nseverity of pain over time than for absolute severity—for \nexample, comparing before and after a certain treatment \nhas been started.\nThe severity of some symptoms can be quantified \nmore precisely; for example, shortness of breath on \nexertion occurring after walking 10 metres on flat \nground is more severe than shortness of breath \noccurring after walking 90 metres up a hill. Central \nchest pain from angina occurring at rest is more \nsignificant than angina occurring while running 90 \nmetres to catch a bus.\nIt is relevant to quantify the severity of each \nsymptom—but also to remember that symptoms that \na patient considers mild may be very significant.\nAssociated symptoms\nHere an attempt is made to uncover in a systematic \nway those symptoms that might be expected to be \nassociated with disease of a particular area. Initial \nand most thorough attention must be given to the \nsystem that includes the presenting problem (see \nQuestions box 1.1). Remember that, although a \nsingle symptom may provide the clue that leads to \nthe correct diagnosis, usually it is the combination of \ncharacteristic symptoms that most reliably suggests the \ndiagnosis.\n",

Even after full \nrecovery from a life-threatening illness, some people \nmay be permanently affected by loss of confidence or \nself-esteem. There may be continuing anxieties about \nthe capability of supporting a family. Try to find out \nhow the patient and his or her family have been affected. \nHow has the patient coped so far, and what are the \nexpectations and hopes for the future with regard to \nhealth? What explanations of the condition has the \npatient been given or obtained (e.g. from the internet)?\nHelping a patient to manage ill-health is a large \npart of the clinician’s duty. This depends on sympathetic \nand realistic explanations of the probable future course \nof the disease and the effects of treatment.\nDRUG AND TREATMENT \nHISTORY\nAsk the patient whether he or she is currently taking \nany tablets or medicines (the use of the word ‘drug’ \nmay cause alarm); the patient will often describe these \nby colour or size rather than by name and dose.c Then \nask the patient to show you all his or her medications \n(see Fig. 1.2), if possible, and list them. Note the dose, \nlength of use, indication for each drug and any side \neffects.\nThis drug list may provide a useful clue to chronic \nor past illnesses, otherwise forgotten. For example, a \npatient who denies a history of high blood pressure \nmay remember when asked why he or she is taking an \nantihypertensive drug having an elevated blood pressure \nin the past. Remember that some drugs are prescribed \nas transdermal patches or subcutaneous implants (e.g. \ncontraceptives and hormonal treatment of carcinoma \nof the prostate). Ask whether the drugs were taken as \nprescribed. Always ask specifically whether a woman \nis taking the contraceptive pill, because many who take \nit do not consider it a medicine or tablet. The same is \ntrue of inhalers, or what many patients call their ‘puffers’.\nTo remind the patient, it is often worthwhile to ask \nabout the use of classes of drugs. A basic list should \ninclude questions about treatment for:\n•\t blood pressure\n•\t high cholesterol\n",

Aspirin and standard non-steroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but not paracetamol \n(acetaminophen), can cause gastrointestinal bleeding. \nPatients with chronic pain may consume large amounts \nof analgesics, including drugs containing opioids such \nas codeine and morphine. These may be used in the \nform of skin patches. A careful history of the period \nof use of opioids and the quantities used is important, \nbecause they are drugs of dependence.\nMany patients have printed copies of parts of their \nelectronic records with lists of drugs.

More information \nabout these substances and their effects is becoming \navailable and there is an increasing responsibility for \nclinicians to be aware of them and to ask about them \ndirectly.\nAsk (where relevant—not the 90-year-old nursing \nhome resident) about ‘recreational’ or street drug use \n(vide infra). The use of intravenous drugs has many \nimplications for the patient’s health. Ask whether any \nattempt has been made to avoid sharing needles. This may \nprotect against the injection of viruses, but not against \nbacterial infection from the use of impure substances. \nCocaine use has become a common cause of myocardial \ninfarction in young people in some countries. Acutely \nill patients may have taken overdoses of drugs whose \npurity has been underestimated (especially narcotics) \nor taken drugs without knowing what they are. The use \nof amphetamine-like drugs at parties can be associated \nwith dehydration with electrolyte abnormalities and \npsychotic symptoms. Here an attempt to find out \nmore detail from the patient or other party-goers is \nessential.\nNot all medical problems are treated with drugs. \nAsk about courses of physiotherapy or rehabilitation \nfor musculoskeletal problems or injuries, or to help \nrecovery following surgery or a severe illness. Certain \ngastrointestinal conditions are treated with dietary \nsupplements (e.g. pancreatic enzymes for chronic \npancreatitis) or restrictions (e.g. avoidance of gluten \nfor coeliac disease).\nPAST HISTORY\nSome patients may feel that questions about past \nproblems and the more general questions asked in the \nsystems review (p 19) are somewhat intrusive. It may \nbe best to preface these questions by saying something \nlike, ‘I need to ask you some questions about your past \nmedical problems and general health. These may affect \nyour current investigations and treatment.’\nAsk the patient whether he or she has had any \nserious illnesses, operations or admissions to hospital \nin the past, including any obstetric or gynaecological \nproblems. Where relevant obtain the details. Do not \nforget to enquire about childhood illnesses. Ask about \npast blood transfusion (including when and what for). \nSerious or chronic childhood illnesses may have \ninterfered with a child’s education and social activities \nlike sport. Ask what the patient remembers and thinks \nabout this.\nPrevious illnesses or operations may have a direct \nbearing on current health. It is worth asking specifically \nabout certain operations that have a continuing effect \non the patient—for example, operations for malignancy, \nbowel surgery or cardiac surgery, especially valve \nsurgery. Implanted prostheses are common in surgical, \northopaedic and cardiac procedures. These may involve \na risk of infection of the foreign body, whereas magnetic \nmetals—especially most cardiac pacemakers—are a \ncontraindication to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). \nChronic kidney disease (CKD) may be a contraindication \nto X-rays using iodine contrast materials and MRI \nscanning using gadolinium contrast. Pregnancy is \nusually a contraindication to radiation exposure (X-\nrays and nuclear scans—remember that computed \ntomography [CT] scans cause hundreds of times the \nradiation exposure of simple X-rays).\nThe patient may believe that he or she has had \na particular diagnosis made in the past, but careful \nquestioning may reveal this as unlikely. For example, \nthe patient may mention a previous duodenal ulcer, \nbut not have had any investigations or treatment for \nit, which makes the diagnosis less certain. Therefore, it \nis important to obtain the particulars of each relevant \npast illness, including the symptoms experienced, tests \nperformed and treatments prescribed. The mature \nclinician needs to maintain an objective scepticism \nabout the information that is obtained from the \npatient.\nPatients with chronic illnesses may have had their \ncondition managed with the help of various doctors \nand at specialised clinics. For example, patients with \ndiabetes mellitus are often managed by a team of health \nprofessionals including diabetic educators, nurses and \ndietitians. Find out what supervision and treatment \nthese have provided. For example, who does the patient \ncontact if there is a problem with the insulin dose, and \ndoes the patient know what to do (an action plan) if \nthere is an urgent or a dangerous complication? Patients \nwith chronic diseases are often very much involved in \ntheir own care and are very well informed about aspects \nof their treatment. For example, diabetics should keep \nrecords of their home-measured blood sugar levels, \n",

These patients will often make their own \nadjustments to their medication doses. Assessing a \npatient’s understanding of and confidence in making \nthese changes should be part of the history taking.\nIt should be routine to find out whether the \nadult patient is up to date with the recommended \nimmunisations (e.g. mumps, measles, rubella, tetanus, \netc.) as well as other recent immunisations (e.g. \nfor human papilloma virus [HPV], hepatitis B, \npneumococcal disease, Haemophilus influenzae or \ninfluenza) (p 30).\nAsk what other medical practitioners the patient \nsees and whether he or she wants copies of your report \nsent to them. Patients have the right not to have \ninformation sent to other doctors if they choose.\nAdditional history for the \nfemale patient\nFor women, a menstrual history should be obtained; \nit is particularly relevant for a woman with abdominal \npain, a suspected endocrine disease or genitourinary \nsymptoms. Write down the date of the last menstrual \nperiod. Ask about the age at which menstruation \nbegan, whether the periods are regular or whether \nmenopause has occurred. Ask whether the symptoms \noccur at a particular time in the menstrual cycle. Do \nnot forget to ask a woman of childbearing age if there \nis a possibility of pregnancy; this, for example, may \npreclude the use of certain investigations or drugs.15 \nObserving the well-known axiom that ‘every woman of \nchildbearing years is pregnant until proven otherwise’ \ncan prevent unnecessary danger to the unborn child \nand avoid embarrassment for the unwary clinician. Ask \nabout any miscarriages. Record gravida (the number of \npregnancies) and para (the number of births of babies \nover 20 weeks’ gestation).\nSOCIAL HISTORY\nThis is the time to find out more about the patient as \na person. The questions should be asked in an interested \nand conversational way and should not sound like a \nroutine learned by rote. For example, chronic pain can \naffect relationships, employment, income and leisure \nactivities, and it is your job to understand these matters \nin order to provide the best possible care plan.\nUpbringing and \neducation level\nAsk first about the places of birth and residence, and \nthe level of education obtained (including problems \nwith schooling caused by childhood illnesses). This \ncan influence the way things need to be explained to \nthe patient. Recent migrants may have been exposed to \ninfectious diseases like tuberculosis; ethnic background \nis important in some diseases, such as thalassaemia \nand sickle cell anaemia.\nMarital status, social \nsupport and living \nconditions\nTo determine the patient’s marital status, ask who is \nliving at home with the patient. Find out about the \nhealth of the spouse and any children. Check whether \nthere are any other household members. If the patient is \nnot able to look after him- or herself unaided, establish \nwho the patient’s main ‘caregiver’ is. ‘Matter of fact’ \nquestions about sexual activity may be very relevant. For \nexample, erectile dysfunction may occur in neurological \nconditions, debilitating illness or psychiatric disease. \nQuestions about living arrangements are particularly \nimportant for chronic or disabling illnesses, where it \nis necessary to know what social support is available \nand whether the patient is able to manage at home (e.g. \nthe number of steps required to get into the house, or \nthe location of the toilet).\nAsk whether the patient considers him- or herself \nto be a spiritual person. Spirituality is an important \nfactor, especially in the care of dying patients, in the \ncreation of living wills and in understanding the support \nnetwork available for the patient.\nThe presence of pets in the home may be important \nif infections or allergies are suspected.\nAsk about mobility (e.g. if an adult patient is still \ndriving and how he or she gets to the shops and \nappointments).\n",

Note any hospitalisations or \nprocedures overseas. Travel overseas, if hospitalised, \nmay be associated with acquiring antibiotic-resistant \nbacteria. Ask about the patient’s immunisation status \n(see Ch 2). Determine whether any prophylactic drugs \n(e.g. for malaria) were taken during the travel period.\nSmoking\nThe patient may claim to be a non-smoker if he or \nshe stopped smoking that morning. Therefore, ask \nwhether the patient has ever smoked and, if so, how \nmany cigarettes (or cigars or pipes) were smoked a day \nand for how many years. Find out whether the patient \nhas stopped smoking and, if so, when this was. It is \nnecessary to ask how many packets of cigarettes per \nday the patient has smoked and for how many years \nthe patient has smoked. An estimate should be made \nof the number of packet-years of smoking. Remember \nthat this estimate is based on 20-cigarette packetsd and \nthat packets of cigarettes are getting larger; curiously, \nmost manufacturers now make packets of 30 or 35. \nMore recently, giant packets of 50 have appeared: these \nare too large to fit into a pocket and must be carried \nin the hands as a constant reminder to the patient of \nhis or her addiction.\nCigarette smoking is a risk factor for vascular \ndisease, chronic lung disease, several cancers and peptic \nulceration, and may damage the fetus (see List 1.2). \nThe more recent the exposure and the greater the \nnumber of packet-years, the greater the risk of these \nproblems becomes. Cigar and pipe smokers typically \ninhale less smoke than cigarette smokers and overall \nmortality rates are correspondingly lower in this group, \nexcept from carcinoma of the oral cavity, larynx and \noesophagus.\nAs a routine this may be a good time to give a \ngentle reminder about smoking cessation. Suggesting \n‘This might be a good time to think about becoming \na non-smoker’ avoids giving the impression that the \nDiet and exercise\nAsk about the adequacy of the patient’s diet, who does \nthe cooking, the availability of ‘meals on wheels’ and \nother services such as house cleaning. Also ask how \nphysically active the patient is.\nOccupation and hobbies\nAsk the patient about present occupation;16 the WHACS \nmnemonic is useful here:17\nW\that do you do?\nH\t ow do you do it?\nA\tre you concerned about any of your exposures \nor experiences?\nC\tolleagues or others exposed?\nS\t atisfied with your job?\nFinding out exactly what the patient does at work can \nbe helpful, as some occupations (and hobbies) are linked \nto disease (see Text box 1.2). Note particularly any \nwork exposure to dusts, chemicals or disease; for \nexample, mine and industrial workers may have the \ndisease asbestosis. Find out whether any similar \nproblems have affected fellow workers.

In the United \nStates, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and \nAlcoholism (NIAAA) suggests that the following alcohol \nlevels are harmful: for men under the age of 65, an \naverage of more than 14 standard drinks per week (or \nmore than 4 drinks on any day); and for women and \nall adults 65 years and older an average of more than \n7 standard drinks per week. Alcohol becomes a major \nrisk factor for liver disease in men who consume more \nthan 80 g daily and women who consume more than \n40 g daily for 5 years or longer.\nAlcoholics are notoriously unreliable about \ndescribing their alcohol intake, so it may be important \nto suspend belief and sometimes (with the patient’s \npermission) talk to relatives.\nCertain questions can be helpful in making a \ndiagnosis of alcoholism; these are referred to as the \nCAGE questions:21\nHave you ever felt you ought to Cut down on \nyour drinking?\nHave people Annoyed you by criticising your \ndrinking?\nHave you ever felt bad or Guilty about your \ndrinking?\nHave you ever had a drink first thing in the \nmorning to steady your nerves or get rid of a \nhangover?

An \nexcellent screening question that is 100% sensitive (and \n74% specific) is to ask, ‘How many times in the past \nyear have you used an illegal drug or used a prescription \nmedication for non-medical reasons?’24 Asking about \n‘recreational’ or street drug use, if not already known, \nis important.\nMood\nDepression severe enough to cause distress to a patient \nis common: it has a prevalence of up to 8%.25 Depression \ncan be the result of any significant medical illness; in \nfact, the incidence of depression increases threefold \nfor these patients. Patients with underlying depression \nmay find illness more difficult to cope with. Questioning \npatients about depression can be difficult. A common \napproach is to ask first, ‘How are things going at home \nand at work at the moment?’ Questions about depressed \nmood (see p 25, Questions box 2.2) and anhedonia \n(loss of interest or pleasure in activities previously \nenjoyed) can be helpful. Major depression is unlikely \nif the answer to these questions is ‘no’.\nCertain medical conditions such as hypothyroidism \nor Cushing’s disease can be direct causes of depression.\nIf depression seems likely, questions about suicide \nrisk should be asked. There is no evidence that asking \nsuch questions increases the risk of suicide (see Ch 46, \nVolume 2).26\nSexual history\nThe sexual history may be relevant; if so, specific \nquestions should be asked. Good judgement is necessary \nabout the right time to ask very personal questions \n(see p 27).\nFAMILY HISTORY\nMany diseases run in families. For example, ischaemic \nheart disease that has developed at a young age in \nparents or siblings is a major risk factor for ischaemic \nheart disease in their offspring. Various malignancies, \nsuch as breast and large-bowel carcinoma, are more \ncommon in certain families. Both genetic and common \nenvironmental exposures may explain these familial \nassociations. Some diseases (e.g. haemophilia) are \ndirectly inherited.27 Patient reporting of a family history \n FACTORS SUGGESTING AN INCREASED \nRISK TO A PATIENT BECAUSE OF  \nGENETIC FACTORS\n• \nFamily history of numerous relatives affected \nby the disorder, e.g. three family members \nwith bowel cancer\n• \nDisease occurring in less-often-affected sex, \ne.g. thyroid disease in male relatives\n• \nEarlier onset of disease than usual in \nrelatives, e.g. premature coronary artery \ndisease\n• \nDisease occurring despite absence in patient \nof the usual risk factors, e.g. hyperlipidaemia \ndespite normal weight and excellent diet\n• \nRacial predisposition to a disease, e.g. \nhaemochromatosis in people of Irish descent\n• \nConsanguinity of parents, e.g. cystic fibrosis\nLIST 1.4\nof malignancy is not always accurate. However, two \nimportant cancers—bowel and breast—are accurately \nreported by patients.\nAsk about any history of a similar illness in the \nfamily. Certain factors suggest an increased genetic \nrisk (List 1.4).\nEnquire about the health and, if relevant, the causes \nof death and ages of death of the parents and siblings. \nIf there is any suggestion of a hereditary disease, a \ncomplete family tree should be compiled showing all \nmembers affected (see Fig. 1.3). Patients can be reluctant \nto mention that they have relatives with mental illness, \nepilepsy or cancer, so ask tactfully about these diseases. \nConsanguinity (usually first cousins marrying) increases \nthe probability of autosomal recessive abnormalities in \nthe children; ask about this if the pedigree is suggestive.\nSYSTEMS REVIEW\nAs well as detailed questioning about the system likely \nto be diseased, it is essential to ask about important \nsymptoms and disorders in other systems (see Questions \nbox 1.1), as otherwise important diseases may be \nmissed.28,29 An experienced clinician will perform a \ntargeted systems review, based on information already \nobtained from the patient; clearly it is not realistic to \nask anyone all of the listed questions.\nWhen recording the systems review, list important \nnegative answers (‘relevant negatives’).

Avoid what might \nbe seen as a judgemental attitude to anything you hear. \nThis should not prevent you from giving sensible advice \nabout activities that are dangerous to the patient’s health. \nExpressing sympathy about the patient’s problems \n(medical or otherwise) should be a normal human \nreaction on the part of the clinician.\nTAKING A GOOD HISTORY\nCommunication and history-taking skills can be learned \nbut require constant practice. Watch for signs that the \npatient is uncomfortable. For example, the sudden \nbreaking off of eye contact or the crossing of arms or \nlegs: this body language suggests that the patient is not \ncomfortable with the questioning and you need to \nredirect or change tack.5 Factors that improve \ncommunication include using appropriate open-ended \nquestions, giving frequent summaries, and using \nclarification and negotiation.3,4,6 (See List 2.1.)\nTHE DIFFERENTIAL \nDIAGNOSIS\nAs the interview proceeds, you will need to begin to \nconsider the possible diagnosis or diagnoses—the \ndifferential diagnosis. This usually starts as a long and \nill-defined mental list in your mind. As more detail of \nthe symptoms emerges, the list becomes more defined. \nThis mental list must be used as a guide to further \nquestioning in the latter part of the interview. Specific \nquestions should then be used to help confirm or \neliminate various possibilities. The physical examination \nand investigations may then be directed to help further \nnarrow the differential. At the end of the history and \nexamination, a likely diagnosis and list of differential \ndiagnoses should be drawn up. This will often be \nmodified as results of tests emerge.\nThis method of history taking is called, rather \ngrandly, the hyopthetico-deductive approach. It is in \nfact used by most experienced clinicians. History taking \ndoes not mean asking a series of set questions of every \npatient, but rather knowing what questions to ask as \nthe differential diagnosis begins to become clearer.\nFUNDAMENTAL \nCONSIDERATIONS WHEN \nTAKING THE HISTORY\nAs the medical interview proceeds, keep in mind four \nunderlying principles:\n1.\tWhat is the probable diagnosis so far? This is a \nbasic differential diagnosis. As you complete the \nhistory of the presenting illness, ask yourself: \n‘For this patient based on these symptoms and \nwhat I know so far, what are the most likely \ndiagnoses?’ Think about the anatomical location, \nthen the likely pathology or pathophysiology, \nthen the possible causes, then direct additional \nquestions accordingly.\n2.\tCould any of these symptoms represent an urgent \nor dangerous diagnosis—red-flag (alarm) \nsymptoms? Such diagnoses may have to be \na\t This does not happen often but Christmas disease is an example of a \ndisease named after the patient rather than the clinician.\n",

Repeat the \n‘What else?’ question as often as required.\n• \nMaintain comfortable eye contact and an \nopen posture. Do not cross your legs, and do \nnot lean backwards.\n• \nUse the head nod appropriately, and use \nsilences to encourage the patient to express \nhim- or herself.\n• \nWhen there are breaks in the narrative, \nprovide a summary for the patient by briefly \nrestating the facts or feelings identified, to \nmaximise accuracy and demonstrate active \nlistening.\n• \nClarify the list of chief or presenting \ncomplaints with the patient, rather than \nassuming that you know them.\n• \nIf you are confused about the chronology of \nevents or other issues, admit it and ask the \npatient to clarify.\n• \nMake sure the patient’s story is internally \nconsistent and, if not, ask more questions to \nverify the facts.\n• \nIf emotions are uncovered, name the patient’s \nemotion and indicate that you understand \n(e.g. ‘You seem sad’). Show respect and \nexpress your support (e.g. ‘It’s understandable \nthat you would feel upset’).\n• \nAsk about any other concerns the patient \nmay have, and address specific fears.\n• \nExpress your support and willingness to \ncooperate with the patient to help solve the \nproblems together.\nLIST 2.1\nseriousness. Ask yourself: ‘What diagnoses must \nnot be missed?’\n3.\tCould these symptoms be due to one of the \nmimicking diseases that can present with a great \nvariety of symptoms in different parts of the body? \nTuberculosis used to be the great example of this, \nbut HIV infection, syphilis, sarcoidosis and \nvasculitis are also important disease ‘mimickers’. \nAnxiety and depression commonly present with \nmany bodily (somatic) symptoms.\n4.\tIs the patient trying to tell me about something \nmore than these symptoms alone? Apparently \ntrivial symptoms may be worrying to the patient \nbecause of an underlying anxiety about \nsomething else. Asking ‘What is it that has made \nyou concerned about these problems now?’ or ‘Is \nthere anything else you want to talk about?’ may \nhelp clarify this aspect. Ask the patient ‘What \nelse?’ as natural breaks occur in the conversation.\nPERSONAL HISTORY TAKING\nCertain aspects of history taking go beyond routine \nquestioning about symptoms. This part of the art needs \nto be learned by taking a lot of histories; practice is \nabsolutely essential. With time you will gain confidence \nin dealing with patients whose medical, psychiatric or \ncultural situations make standard questioning difficult \nor impossible.7,8\nMost illnesses are upsetting and can induce feelings \nof anxiety or depression. On the other hand, patients \nwith primary psychiatric illnesses often present with \nphysical rather than psychological symptoms. This \nbrain–body interaction is bidirectional, and this must \nbe understood as you obtain the story.\nDiscussion of sensitive matters may actually be \ntherapeutic in some cases. Sympathetic confrontation \ncan be helpful in some situations. For example, if the \npatient appears sad, angry or frightened, referring to \nthis in a tactful way may lead to the patient volunteering \nappropriate information.\nIf you obtain an emotional response, use \nemotion-handling skills (NURS) to deal with this \nduring the interview (see Text box 2.1).\nThe patient may be reluctant or initially unable to \ndiscuss sensitive problems with a stranger. Here, gaining \nthe patient’s confidence is critical.

It is not the clinician’s role to appear to judge \npatients or their lives.\nAny medical illness may affect the psychological \nstatus of a patient. Moreover, pre-existing psychological \nfactors may influence the way a medical problem \npresents. Psychiatric disease can also present with \nmedical symptoms. Therefore, an essential part of the \nhistory-taking process is to obtain information about \npsychological distress and the patient’s mental state. \nA sympathetic, unhurried approach using open-ended \nquestions will provide much information that can then \nbe systematically recorded after the interview. If \ndepression is a concern, it is safe to ask about suicidal \nideation.9\nThe formal psychological or psychiatric interview \ndiffers from general medical history taking. It takes \nconsiderable time for patients to develop rapport with, \nand confidence in, the interviewer. There are certain \nstandard questions that may give valuable insights into \nthe patient’s state of mind (see Questions boxes 2.1–2.3). \nIt may be important to obtain much more detailed \ninformation about each of these problems, depending \non the clinical circumstances (see Ch 46).\nCommon general symptoms\nFatigue\nUp to 30% of people will report that they are often \nor always tired.

Some \npatients may be embarrassed to discuss medical problems \nin front of a relative, and relatives are often tempted to \nexplain (or change) the patient’s answers instead of just \ntranslating them. Professional translators are trained \nto avoid this and can often provide simultaneous and \naccurate translation, but not all patients feel comfortable \nwith a third person present.\nIt is important to continue to make eye contact \nwith the patient while asking questions, even though \nit will be the interpreter who responds; otherwise the \npatient may feel left out of the discussion. Questions \nshould be directed as if going straight to the patient: \n‘Have you had any problems with shortness of breath?’ \nrather than ‘Has he had any breathlessness?’ It always \ntakes longer to interview a patient using an interpreter, \nand more time should be allowed for the consultation.\nIt is alarmingly common for relatives who accompany \npatients to interrupt and contradict the patient’s version \nof events even when they are not acting as translators. \nThe interposition of a relative between the clinician \nand the patient always makes the history taking less \ndirect and the patient’s symptoms more subject to \n‘filtering’ or interpretation before the information \nreaches the clinician. Try tactfully to direct relatives \nto allow the patient to answer in his or her own words. \nRemember that relatives may be more anxious about \nthe patient than the patient him- or herself.\nAttitudes to illness and disease vary in different \ncultures. Problems considered shameful by the patient \nmay be very difficult for him or her to discuss. In some \ncultures, women may object to being questioned or \nexamined by male doctors or students. Male students \nmay need to be accompanied by a female chaperone \nfor the interview with sensitive female patients, and \ncertainly should have one during the physical \nexamination of the patient. It is most important that \ncultural sensitivities on either side are not allowed to \nprevent a thorough medical assessment.\nPatients including those from an Indigenous \nbackground may have a large extended family. These \nrelatives may be able to provide invaluable support to \nthe patient, but their own medical or social problems \nmay interfere with the patient’s ability to manage his \nor her own health. Commitments to family members \nmay make it difficult for the patient to attend medical \nappointments or to travel for specialist treatment. \nDetailed questioning about family contacts and \nresponsibilities may help with the planning of the \npatient’s treatment.\nRecent concepts in Indigenous healthcare include the \nnotions of cultural awareness, cultural sensitivity and \ncultural safety.17 Cultural awareness can be thought of as \nthe first step towards understanding the rituals, beliefs, \ncustoms and practices of a culture. Cultural sensitivity \nmeans accepting the importance and roles of these \ndifferences. Cultural safety means using this knowledge \nto protect patients and communities from danger, and \nmaking sure that there is a genuine partnership between \nhealth workers and their Indigenous patients. These \nskills have general application for all cultural groups \nbut vary in detail from one to another.\nAll of these matters require an especially sensitive \napproach. You as a clinician need to be impartial and \nobjective.\nTHE ‘UNCOOPERATIVE’ OR \n‘DIFFICULT’ PATIENT\nMost clinical encounters involve a cooperative effort \non the part of the patient and the clinician. The patient \nwants help to find out what is wrong and to get better. \nThis should make the meeting satisfying and friendly \nfor both parties. However, interviews do not always \nrun smoothly.18\nResentment may occur on both sides if the \npatient seems not to be taking the doctor’s advice \nseriously, or will not cooperate with attempts at history \ntaking or examination. Unless there is a serious \npsychiatric or neurological problem that impairs \nthe patient’s judgement, taking or not taking advice \nremains the patient’s prerogative. The clinician’s role is \nto give advice and explanation, not to dictate. Indeed, \nit must be realised that the advice may not always be \ncorrect. Keeping this in mind will help prevent that \nmost unsatisfactory and unprofessional of outcomes—\nbecoming angry with the patient. In all cases you should \n",

The \npossibilities to be considered include alcohol or drug \nwithdrawal, an intracranial lesion such as a tumour or \nsubdural haematoma, or a psychiatric disease such as \nparanoid schizophrenia. In other cases, resentment at \nthe occurrence of illness may be the problem.\nSome patients may seem difficult because they are \ntoo cooperative. The patient concerned about his blood \npressure may have brought printouts of his own blood \npressure measurements at half-hour intervals for several \nweeks. It is important to show restrained interest \nin these recordings, without encouraging excessive \nenthusiasm in the patient. Other patients may bring \nwith them information about their symptoms or a \ndiagnosis obtained from the internet. It is important \nto remember, and perhaps to point out, that information \nobtained in this way may not have been subjected to \nany form of peer review.\nPeople with a chronic illness or rare disease, on the \nother hand, may know more about their condition than \ntheir medical attendants and they may seem difficult \nbecause they are knowledgeable. The best approach \nis to say that this is an unusual condition and you \nwill need to find out more about the latest aspects of \nits management and get back to the patient. Accept \ngratefully material offered by the patient about the \ncondition. Saying ‘This is a complicated problem and \nwe may need the help of a specialist in this area’ is a \nvery reasonable approach.\nSometimes the interests of the patient and the \ndoctor are not the same. This is especially so in cases \nwhere there is the possibility of compensation for an \nillness or injury. These patients may, consciously or \nunconsciously, attempt to manipulate the encounter. \nThis is a very difficult situation and can be approached \nonly by rigorous application of clinical methods.\nOccasionally, attempted manipulation takes the form \nof flattery or inappropriate personal interest directed \nat the clinician. This should be dealt with by carefully \nmaintaining professional detachment. The clinician \nand the patient must be conscious that their meeting \nis a professional and not a social one. Sometimes \npatients offer inappropriate gifts.19 This may be seen \nas a way of obtaining more attention or becoming \nmore important. Valuable gifts should not be accepted \nand the patient should be told that it is not ethical to \naccept something of this sort. The danger of medical \nstudents finding themselves in this position is small, \nhowever.\nSELF-HARMING AND \nMÜNCHHAUSEN’S \nSYNDROME\nWhen patients give a history of contact with numerous \ndoctors and of many investigations and procedures \nwithout definite diagnoses, you should think, ‘Could \nthis be a fictitious disorder?’c The assumption that \npatients who come to the doctor want help and do not \ndeliberately try to deceive tends to delay the diagnosis \nin these cases. Careful history taking and consultation \nwith colleagues previously involved in the patient’s care \nmay help avoid further unnecessary investigations and \ntreatment.\nHISTORY TAKING FOR \nTHE MAINTENANCE OF \nGOOD HEALTH\nThere has never been more public awareness of the \ninfluence the way people live has on their health. Most \npeople have some understanding of the dangers of \nsmoking, excessive alcohol consumption and obesity. \nPeople have more varied views on what constitutes a \nhealthy diet and exercise regimen, and many are \nignorant of what constitutes risky sexual activity.\nThe first interview with a patient is an opportunity \nto make an assessment of the patient’s knowledge of \nrisk factors for a number of important medical \nconditions. Even when the patient has come about an \nunconnected problem, there is often the opportunity \nfor a quick review. Constant matter-of-fact reminding \nabout these can make a great difference to the way \npeople protect themselves from ill-health.\nPart of the thorough assessment of patients includes \nobtaining and conveying some idea of what measures \n",

This includes a comprehensive approach to \nthe combination of risk factors for various diseases, \nwhich is much more important than each individual \nrisk factor. For example, advising a patient about the \nrisk of premature cardiovascular disease will involve \nknowing about the patient’s family history, smoking \nhistory, previous and current blood pressure, current \nand historical cholesterol levels, dietary history and \nassessment for diabetes mellitus and how much exercise \nthe patient undertakes.\nDepending on the patient’s age, ask about screening \ntests being done for any serious illnesses, such as \nmammograms for breast cancer, Pap smears for cervical \ncancer or colonoscopy for colon cancer.20\nThe patient’s awareness and understanding of basic \nmeasures for maintaining good health can be assessed \nthroughout the interview. Even when they are unrelated \nto the presenting problem, serious examples of risky \nbehaviour should be pointed out. This should not be \ndone in an aggressive way. For example, you might \nsay: ‘This might be a good time to make a big effort \nto reduce your consumption of alcohol, because it’s \nespecially unwise for someone like you who has \nabnormal liver function.’\nCertain questions can be helpful in making a \ndiagnosis of alcoholism (see Ch 1). Another approach \nis to ask, ‘Have you ever had a drinking problem?’ and \n‘Did you have your last drink within the last 24 hours?’ \nThe patient who answers ‘yes’ to both questions is likely \nto be a high-risk drinker.\nThe patient’s vaccination record should be reviewed \nregularly and brought up to date when indicated \n(Table 2.1).\nLive vaccines are contraindicated for certain patients \n(List 2.5).\nTravel to rural Asia and other exotic places may be \nan indication for additional vaccinations (e.g. Japanese \nencephalitis, typhoid).\n",

Try to find out whether the patient is happy \nto accept help or not.\nYou should also ask questions about the instrumental \nactivities of daily living (IADL), such as shopping, \ncooking and cleaning, the use of transport, and \nmanaging money and medications.\nEstablish whether the patient has ever been assessed \nby an occupational therapist or whether there has been \na ‘home visit’. Ask whether alterations have been made \nto the house (e.g. installation of ramps, railings in the \nbathroom, emergency call buttons).\nFind out who lives with the patient and how they \nseem to be coping with the patient’s illness. Obviously, \nthe amount of detail required depends on the severity \nand chronicity of the patient’s illness.\nPolypharmacy\nTry to find out what drugs the patient is taking, how \nlong each drug has been used and what it is for. It is \nsurprising how many people take medications apparently \nwithout knowing what they are for. (Other patients \nlook up their prescribed drugs on the internet and \nthen become too frightened to take them.) Drugs with \nparticularly high risk in elderly people are shown in \nTable 2.2. In many cases, one drug may have been \ngiven to treat a side effect of another.\nUp to 40% of people over the age of 60 take five \nor more different medications a day—by definition, \npolypharmacy. The risks of side effects and com­\nplications of drugs increase with age. Careful history \ntaking will enable a comprehensive assessment of a \npatient’s drugs and their potential effects. It may lead \nto a trial of ceasing drugs no longer needed. Good \nclinicians regularly review and stop drugs that are not \nbeneficial.\nAdherence\nThere is evidence that up to 50% of patients do not \ntake their medications as prescribed.21 Poor adherence \n(tactfully no longer known as compliance) is more \nlikely when drug regimens are complicated (e.g. \nthree-times-a-day medications), the disease is not \nassociated with symptoms (e.g. hypertension), the \ndrugs are expensive, the patient is young or old, or \nthe treatment is for a psychiatric condition. When \ntreatment seems ineffective, the problem may be \nadherence. Although elaborate ways of determining \nadherence have been developed (e.g. electronic pill \ndispensing, tracking of pharmacy dispensing) these \nare intrusive and expensive.\nCareful questioning may be a helpful way of \ndetermining adherence with medications. Begin with \na neutral remark and questions, such as: ‘Yours is quite \na complicated combination of tablets. Do you think \nyou ever miss any of them? How often? Do you use \na pill-dispensing device (like a Webster packet)?’ (see \nFig. 1.2(b), page 13).\nIn some cases the absence of predictable drug \neffects may be a clue. For example, a normal heart \nrate for a patient prescribed beta-blockers (drugs that \nreduce heart rate) or absence of dark bowel motions \nfor a patient prescribed iron supplements suggests \nnon-adherence to these drugs. It is possible to measure \nthe blood concentrations of many drugs. For example, \nthe level of anticonvulsants can be measured when a \npatient continues to have seizures despite treatment.\nAssessing adherence, at least by careful questioning, \nis important before more treatment is added for patients \nwho are apparently not responding to medications.\nMental state\nAsk questions that may help to assess cognitive function. \nIs there a family history of dementia? Has the patient \nnoticed problems with memory or with aspects of life, \nsuch as paying bills?\nAsk about depression. Severe depression can affect \ncognitive function.\nDelirium refers to confusion and altered con­\nsciousness. Do not confuse this with dementia, where \n",

If \nindicated, perform a formal mental state examination \n(see Ch 46).\nSpecific problems in \nthe elderly\nFalls and loss of balance are common and dangerous \nfor elderly patients. Hip fractures and head injuries are \nlife-threatening events. Ask about falls and near-falls. \nDoes the patient use a stick or a frame? Are there \nhazards in the house that increase the risk (e.g. steep \nand narrow stairs)? The use of sedatives like sleeping \ntablets or antianxiety (anxiolytic) drugs and some \nantihypertensive drugs increases the risk of falls and \nmust be assessed.\nScreening for osteoporosis is recommended for all \nwomen over the age of 65 and all men aged 70 and \nolder. Risk factors for osteoporosis include being \nunderweight, heavy alcohol use, use of corticosteroids, \nearly menopause and a history of previous fractures.\nGeneral questions about mobility should also include \nasking about reasons for immobility. These may include \narthritis, obesity, general muscle weakness and proximal \nmuscle weakness (sometimes due to corticosteroid use).\nElder abuse (emotional, physical and sexual) \ndoes occur; to detect it, it is important to understand \nthe patient’s social circumstances. Useful screening \nquestions to ask (without the carer present) include:\n•\t Do you feel safe where you live?\n•\t Who makes your meals?\n•\t Who handles your finances?22,23\nAdvance care planning \n(advance health directives)\nPatients may have strong feelings about the extent of \ntreatment they want if their condition deteriorates. \nThese should be recorded before a deteriorating medical \nillness makes the patient incapable of expressing his \nor her wishes. In a living will, patients record their \ndecisions about consenting to medical interventions \nand this legal document comes into effect when they \ncan no longer make their own decisions. Encourage \npatients to discuss the plan with their doctor, appoint \nsomeone to make decisions on their behalf and provide \ncopies of the legal documentation to the people who \ncare for them at home and their doctors.\nThis can be a difficult area. If a patient expresses \na wish not to have certain treatments, the clinician \nmust make very sure that patient understands the \nnature and likely success of these treatments. For \nexample, a patient who expresses a wish not to be \nrevived if her heart stops after a myocardial infarct \nmay not understand that early ventricular fibrillation \nis often successfully treated by cardioversion without \nlong-term sequelae. Patients’ decisions must be informed \ndecisions.\nPATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY\nPatients have a right to expect that the things they say \nand the results of their tests will be kept confidential. \nThis means not discussing patients, even with colleagues, \nin a way that enables them to be identified. Passing on \ninformation at hand-over rounds or as part of a referral \nis the exception to this. Referral information must be \nrelevant to the patient’s current problem and should \nnot include unnecessary information that the patient \ndoes not want included.\nThe patient’s right to privacy may have to give \nway to public health regulations. Certain infectious \ndiseases and suspected sexual abuse must be notified. \nDoctors in most jurisdictions have a duty to warn \npatients with certain conditions (e.g. visual impairment, \nuncontrolled epilepsy, recurrent syncope) that they must \nnot drive.24\nEVIDENCE-BASED HISTORY \nTAKING AND DIFFERENTIAL \nDIAGNOSIS\nThe principles of evidence-based clinical examination \nare discussed in Chapter 3 in more detail, but they also \nhave an application to history taking. The starting point \nof the differential diagnosis of a certain symptom is the \nlikelihood (or probability) that a certain condition will \noccur in this patient. Most clinicians still rely on their \nown experience when making this assessment, although \nsome information of disease prevalence in different \npopulations is becoming available. Unfortunately, one \nperson’s experience is a relatively small sample, and \npast experience may bias the clinician in favour of or \nagainst a certain diagnosis.\n",

      "text": "34\t\nSECTION 1  The general principles of history taking and physical examination\n\t\nSome diagnoses may largely be excluded from the \ndifferential diagnosis list at once. This may be based, \nfor example, on the patient’s age, sex or race or the \nextreme rarity of the disease in a particular country. \nFor example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \nwould be very unlikely in a 20-year-old non-smoker \nwho presents with breathlessness.\nThe differential diagnosis is gradually narrowed as \nmore information about the patient’s symptoms comes \nfrom the patient directly, and as a result of specific \nquestioning about features of the symptoms that will \nhelp to refine the list.\nTHE CLINICAL ASSESSMENT\nAfter the physical examination, the interview with the \npatient concludes with your assessment of what the \ndiagnosis or possible diagnoses are, in order of \nprobability. Note that the history is the most powerful \ntool in your toolbox for identifying the likely diagnosis \nin the majority of cases!25 Diagnostic errors in clinical \npractice are usually related to a breakdown in the success \nof the clinical encounter.26 Your assessment is, not \nunreasonably, the most important part of the whole \nprocess from the patient’s point of view.\nThe explanation must relate to the patient’s symptoms \nor perception of the problem. You should explain how \nthe symptoms and any examination findings relate to \nthe diagnosis. For example, if a patient presents with \ndyspnoea, you should begin by saying, ‘I believe \nyour shortness of breath is probably the result of \npneumonia, but there are a few other possibilities.’ The \ncomplexity of the explanation will depend on your \nunderstanding of the patient’s ability to follow any \ntechnical aspects of the diagnosis. The patient’s desire \nfor a detailed explanation is also variable, and this must \nbe taken into account.\nIf the diagnosis is fairly definite, then the prognosis \nand the implications of this must be outlined. A serious \ndiagnosis must be discussed frankly but always in the \ncontext of the variability of outcome for most medical \nconditions and the benefits of correct treatment. \nWhen a patient seems unwilling to accept a serious \ndiagnosis and seems likely to decline treatment, you \nmust attempt to find out the reason for the patient’s \ndecision. Has the patient had previous bad experiences \nwith medical treatment, or has a friend or relative had \na similar diagnosis and a difficult time with treatment \nor complications?\nSometimes blunt language may be justified—for \nexample, ‘It is important for you to realise that this is \na life-threatening illness that needs urgent treatment.’ \nPatients who seem unable to accept advice of this sort \nshould be offered a chance to discuss the matter with \nanother doctor or with their family. This must be done \nsympathetically: ‘This is obviously a difficult time for \nyou. Would you like me to arrange for you to see \nsomeone else for another opinion about it? Or would \nyou like to come back with some of your family to talk \nabout it again?’ The patient’s response should be \ncarefully documented in the notes.\nPatients may need to be cautioned about certain \nactivities until the condition is treated. For example, \na patient with a possible first epileptic seizure must be \ntold that he or she cannot legally drive a motor vehicle.\nCONCLUDING THE \nCONSULTATION\nAfter talking to the patient about the assessment and \nprognosis, the need for investigations and any urgency \ninvolved should be discussed. Admission to hospital \nmay be recommended if the problem is a serious one. \nThis may involve major inconvenience to the patient; \nthe clinician must be ready to justify the recommendation \nand attempt to predict the likely length of stay. If the \ninvestigations are onerous or involve risk, this must \nalso be explained and alternatives discussed, if they \nare available.\nIf drug treatment is being prescribed, the patient \nis entitled to know why this is necessary, what it is \nlikely to achieve and what possible important adverse \neffects might occur. This is a complicated topic. \nOn the clinician’s part, it requires a comprehensive \nunderstanding of drug interactions and adverse effects, \nas well as an assessment of what it is reasonable to tell \na patient without causing alarm or symptoms by \nsuggestion. Patients must at least know what dangerous \nsymptoms should lead to immediate cessation of the \ndrug. Pharmacies often provide patients with long and \nunedited lists of possible adverse effects when they \ndispense drugs. Patients may be too frightened to take \nthe prescription unless these are explained at the time \nof the consultation. Dealing with this difficult area takes \ntime and experience.\n",

By convention, patients are usually \nexamined from the right side of the bed, even though \nthis may be more convenient only for right-handed \npeople. When students learn this, they often feel safer \nhuddling on the left side of the bed with their colleagues \nin tutorial groups, but many tutors are aware of this \nstrategy, particularly when they notice all students \nstanding as far away from the right side of the bed as \npossible.\nIt should be pointed out here that there is only \nlimited evidence-based information concerning the \nvalidity of clinical signs. Many parts of the physical \nexamination are performed as a matter of tradition. \nAs students develop their examination skills, experience \nand new evidence-based data will help them to refine \ntheir use of examination techniques. We have included \ninformation about the established usefulness of signs \nwhere it is available, but have also included signs that \nstudents will be expected to know about despite their \nunproven value.\nThis formal approach to the physical examination \nleads to the examination of the parts of the body \nby body system. For example, examination of the \ncardiovascular system, which includes the heart and \nall the major accessible blood vessels, begins with \npositioning the patient correctly. This is followed by \na quick general inspection and then, rather surprisingly \nfor the uninitiated, seemingly prolonged study of \nthe patient’s fingernails. From there, a set series of \nmanoeuvres brings the doctor to the heart. This type \nof approach applies to all major systems, and is designed \nto discover peripheral signs of disease in the system \nunder scrutiny. The attention of the examining doctor \nis directed particularly towards those systems identified \nin the history as possibly being diseased, but of course \nproper physical examination requires that all the systems \nbe examined.\nThe danger of a systematic approach is that time \nis not taken to stand back and look at the patient’s \ngeneral appearance, which may give many clues to \nthe diagnosis. Doctors must be observant, like a \ndetective (Conan Doyle based his character Sherlock \nHolmes on an outstanding Scottish surgeon).6 Taking \nthe time to make an appraisal of the patient’s general \nappearance, including the face, hands and body, conveys \nthe impression to the patient (and to the examiners) \nthat the doctor or student is interested in the person \nas much as the disease. This general appraisal usually \noccurs at the bedside when patients are in hospital, \nbut for patients seen in the consulting room it should \n",

If using alcohol rub, \nlet it dry and proceed.\n•\t Do not use alcohol rub if your hands are soiled \nor if there is an outbreak of Clostridium difficile \ninfection; use soap and water instead.2\n•\t Do not forget to clean your stethoscope bell and \ndiaphragm with an alcohol wipe after every \nexamination (see Fig. 3.2c).\nTry to examine in a warm room that has good lighting \nso that you maximise your chances of seeing the signs. \nIntroduce yourself and seek the patient’s permission \nto examine him or her. For an examination of the genital \nor anal areas, ask whether the patient would like a \nbegin as the patient walks into the room and during \nthe history taking, and continue at the start of the \nphysical examination.\nDiagnosis has been defined as ‘the crucial process \nthat labels patients and classifies their illnesses, that \nidentifies (and sometimes seals) their likely fates or \nprognoses and that propels us towards specific \ntreatments in the confidence (often unfounded) that \nthey will do more good than harm’.7\nIn normal clinical practice, the detail of the physical \nexamination performed will be ‘targeted’ and will \ndepend on clues from the history and whether the \nconsultation is a follow-up or a new consultation. \nStudents, however, must know how to perform a \ncomplete examination of the body systems, even though \nthey will not often perform this in practice.\nCLINICAL EXAMINATION\nIn clinical examinations you will be expected to \nbe able to demonstrate a polished and thorough \nexamination method—this book will teach you how. \nThe most common examination format is the objective \nstructured clinical examination (OSCE), which is \ndiscussed later in this chapter. Other formats used \ninclude the long case (testing your ability to take the \nhistory, perform a thorough examination and plan \nmanagement, just as people do in clinical practice) \nand the short case (testing your ability to examine a \nspecific part or system and your diagnostic skills, \nwithout knowing the details of the history).\nA high level of competency in history taking and \nphysical examination remains central to the provision \nof effective and safe medical practice. Learn, practise \nand hone these core skills every day.\nHOW TO START\nA few simple steps will help put the patient at ease and \nassist you in completing the examination (see Text box \n3.1). Always wash your hands before and after, to protect \nthe patient and yourself.\nHand washing\nPatients must come first and reducing the spread of \ninfection is your responsibility as a healthcare \nprofessional.

These relate primarily \nto cardiac and respiratory function and comprise:\n•\t pulse\n•\t blood pressure\n•\t respiratory rate\n•\t temperature.\nFor example, an increasing respiratory rate has been \nshown to be an accurate predictor of respiratory failure.8 \nPatients in hospital may have continuous ECG and \npulse oximetry monitoring on display on a monitor. \nThese measurements may be considered an extension \nof the physical examination.\nThe vital signs must be assessed at once if a \npatient appears unwell. Patients in hospital have these \nmeasurements taken regularly and charted. They provide \nimportant basic physiological information.\nFacies\nA specific diagnosis can sometimes be made by \ninspecting the face, its appearance giving a clue to \nthe likely diagnosis. Other physical signs must usually \nbe sought to confirm the diagnosis. Some facial \ncharacteristics are so typical of certain diseases that \nthey immediately suggest the diagnosis and are called \nthe diagnostic facies (the Latin word facies means more \nthan just face, including form, shape, appearance and \ncharacter; see List 3.1 and Figs 3.3–3.12). Apart from \nthese ‘spot diagnoses’, there are several other important \nabnormalities that must be looked for in the face.\nJaundice\nWhen the serum bilirubin level rises to about twice \nthe upper limit of normal, bilirubin is deposited in the \ntissues of the body. It then causes yellow discoloration \nof the skin (jaundice) and, more dramatically, the \napparent discoloration of the sclerae. The usual term \na\t Used by ophthalmologists to stain the cornea for the detection of ulcers.\n SOME IMPORTANT DIAGNOSTIC FACIES\nAcromegalic (see Fig. 3.5)\nAmiodarone (antiarrhythmic drug)—deep blue \ndiscoloration around the malar area and nose \n(see Fig. 3.6)\nAgitated faces—seen with anxiety, mania or \nhyperthyroidism\nCushing’s syndrome (p 460)\nCyanosis (see Figs 3.3, 3.4)\nDepression—flat expression and apathy if severe \n(also seen in hypothyroidism; p 452)\nDown’s syndrome (p 475)\nHippocratic (advanced peritonitis)—eyes are \nsunken, temples collapsed, nose is pinched with \ncrusts on the lips and the forehead is clammy\nLipodystrophic—atrophy of fat (antiretroviral \ntherapy) (see Fig. 3.7)\nMarfan’s syndrome (p 79)\nMitral facies (see Fig. 3.8)\nMyopathic (see Fig. 3.9(a))\nMyotonic (see Fig. 3.9(b))\nMyxoedematous (severe hypothyroidism) (p 452)\nPaget’s disease (p 477)\nParkinson’s disease (p 597)\nRickets (p 474)\nRisus sardonicus* (tetanus; see Fig. 3.10)\nSLE facies (see Fig. 3.11)\nThyrotoxicosis (p 449)\nTurner’s syndrome (p 474)\nVirile facies (see Fig. 3.12)\nLIST 3.1\n*The translation of this Latin phrase is ‘sardonic smile’.\nscleral icterus is misleading, as the bilirubin is actually \ndeposited in the vascular conjunctiva rather than the \navascular sclerae. The sclerae (conjunctivae) are rarely \naffected by other pigment changes. In fact, jaundice \nis the only condition causing yellow sclerae. Other \ncauses of yellow discoloration of the skin, but where \nthe sclerae remain normal, are carotenaemia (usually \ndue to excess consumption of carotene, often from \nintemperate eating of carrots or mangoes), acriflavine, \nfluoresceina and picric acid ingestion.\n",

Scratch marks may be \nprominent due to associated itching (pruritus). The \nother main cause of jaundice is hepatocellular failure. \nGilbert’s disease is also a common cause of jaundice.b \nIt causes a mild elevation of unconjugated bilirubin \nand is due to an inherited enzyme deficiency that \nlimits bilirubin conjugation; it has a benign prognosis. \n(Jaundice is discussed in detail on p 225.)\nCyanosis\nThis refers to a blue discoloration of the skin and \nmucous membranes; it is due to the presence of \ndeoxygenated haemoglobin in superficial blood vessels. \nThe haemoglobin molecules change colour from blue \nto red when oxygen is added to them in the lungs. If \nmore than about 50 g / L of deoxygenated haemoglobin \nis present in the capillary blood, the skin will have a \nbluish tinge.9 Cyanosis does not occur in anaemic \nhypoxia because the total haemoglobin content is low. \nCyanosis is more easily detected in fluorescent light \nthan in daylight.\nCentral cyanosis means that there is an abnormal \namount of deoxygenated haemoglobin in the arteries \nand that a blue discoloration is present in parts of the \nbody with a good circulation, such as the tongue (see \nFig. 3.4). This must be distinguished from peripheral \ncyanosis, which occurs when the blood supply to a \ncertain part of the body is reduced and the tissues \nextract more oxygen than normal from the circulating \nb\t Nicholas Augustin Gilbert (1858–1927), a Paris physician, described this \ncondition in 1900.

Although this is \nat best a crude way of screening for anaemia, it can be \nspecific (though not sensitive) when anaemia is \nsuspected for other reasons. It should be emphasised \nthat pallor is a sign, whereas anaemia is a diagnosis \nbased on laboratory results.\nFacial pallor may also be found in shock, which is \nusually defined as a reduction of cardiac output such \nthat the oxygen demands of the tissues are not being \nmet (see List 3.3).

Is the patient apple (abdominal obesity) \nor pear shaped (generalised obesity including hips \nand thighs)? Obesity is most objectively assessed \nby calculating the body mass index (BMI), whereby \nthe patient’s weight in kilograms is divided by \nthe height in metres squared. Normal is less than \n25 kg / m2. A BMI of ≥30 indicates frank obesity; morbid \nobesity is a BMI >40. Medical risks are increasingly \nrecognised in association with obesity (see List \n3.4). The risk of medical complications of obesity is \nincreased in certain populations including Australian \nAboriginals.\nThe waist–hip ratio (WHR) is also predictive of \nhealth risk. This measurement is of the circumference \nof the waist (at the midpoint between the costal margin \nand the iliac crest) divided by that at the hips (at the \nwidest part around the buttocks). Increased risk occurs \nwhen this exceeds 1.0 for men and 0.85 for women. \nSimple waist measurement correlates with the risks of \nobesity. A waist circumference of more than 80 \ncentimetres for females and 94 centimetres for males \nindicates an increased risk and more than 88 centimetres \nfor females and 102 centimetres for males indicates a \ngreatly increased risk. These measurements can usefully \nbe made repeatedly and recorded.\nSevere underweight (BMI <18.5) is called cachexia.11 \nLook for wasting of the muscles, which may be due to \nneurological or debilitating disease, such as malignancy. \nThere may be signs of vitamin deficiencies described \nlater in this book (pp 279 and 346). For example, vitamin \nC deficiency causes scurvy, which is characterised by \nsmall bleeds around the hair follicles (perifollicular \nhaemorrhages; see Fig. 3.13) as well as bruising. Vitamin \nK deficiency also causes bruising but not perifollicular \nhaemorrhages.\nNote excessively short or tall stature, which may \nbe rather difficult to judge when the patient is lying \nin bed. Inspect for limb deformity or missing limbs \n(rather embarrassing if missed in viva examinations) \nand observe whether the physique is consistent with \nthe patient’s stated chronological age.

This is called postural hypotension. \nAn increase in the pulse rate of 30 beats per minute \nor more, when the patient stands, is also a sign of \nhypovolaemia.\nWeigh the patient.

Apart from being polite, this may \nhelp make the diagnosis of dystrophia myotonica, a \nrare muscle disease in which the patient may be unable \nto let go. Shaking hands is also an acceptable and gentle \nway of introducing the physical examination. The \nphysical examination is an intrusive event that is \ntolerated only because of the doctor’s (and even the \nmedical student’s) professional and cultural standing.\nExamination of the hands by looking, feeling and \nmoving is the gateway to diagnosis in many cases. There \nis no subspecialty of internal medicine in which \nexamination of the hands is not rewarding. The shape \nof the nails may change in some cardiac and respiratory \ndiseases, the whole size of the hand may increase in \ngrowth hormone excess (acromegaly; p 456), gross \ndistortion of the hands’ architecture occurs in some \nOnychogryphosis: finger- or toenails shaped \nlike a talon.\nFIGURE 3.16\n   This deformity is due to repeated trauma or \ncandida infection.

This \nsmell will be on his or her clothes and even on the \nreferral letter kept in a bag or pocket next to a packet \nof cigarettes. Recent consumption of alcoholic drinks \nmay be obvious. ‘Bad breath’, although often of uncertain \ncause, may be related to poor dental hygiene, gingivitis \n(infection of the gums) or nasopharyngeal tumours. \nChronic suppurative infections of the lung can make \nthe breath and saliva foul smelling.\nSkin abscesses may be very offensive, especially if \ncaused by anaerobic organisms or Pseudomonas spp. \nUrinary incontinence is associated with the characteristic \nsmell of stale urine, which is often more offensive if \nthe patient has a urinary tract infection. The smell of \nbacterial vaginosis is usually just described as offensive. \nSevere bowel obstruction and the rare gastrocolic fistula \ncan cause faecal contamination of the breath when the \npatient belches.

Look for an obvious source \nof infection such as a wound infection after surgery, \noozing pus (and remember: increasing wound pain is \nan indicator of possible underlying infection).\nSIRS can occur not only in infection but also after \nsurgery and with pancreatitis, burns, pulmonary emboli \nor autoimmune disease.16\nVery high temperatures (hyperpyrexia, defined as \nabove 41.6°C) are a serious problem and may result in \ndeath. The causes include heat stroke from exposure or \nexcessive exertion (e.g. in marathon runners), malignant \nhyperthermia (a group of rare genetically determined \ndisorders in which hyperpyrexia occurs in response to \nvarious anaesthetic agents [e.g. halothane] or muscle \nrelaxants [e.g. suxamethonium]), the neuroleptic \nmalignant syndrome (a reaction to antipsychotic \nmedication), and hypothalamic disease.\nHypothermia is defined as a temperature of less \nthan 35°C. Normal thermometers do not record below \n35°C and therefore special low-reading thermometers \nmust be used if hypothermia is suspected. Causes of \nhypothermia include hypothyroidism and prolonged \nexposure to cold.\n",

The \nmetallic smell of fresh blood, sometimes detectable \nduring interventional cardiological procedures, is very \nmild by comparison.\nPREPARING THE PATIENT \nFOR EXAMINATION\nAn accurate physical examination is best performed \nwhen the examining conditions are ideal. This means \nthat, if possible, the patient should be in a well-lit room \n(preferably daylight) from which distracting noises and \ninterruptions have been excluded (rarely possible in \nbusy hospital wards). Screens must be drawn around \npatients before the examination. Consulting rooms and \noutpatient clinics should be set up to ensure privacy \nand comfort for patients.\nPatients have a right to expect that students and \ndoctors will have washed their hands or rubbed them \nwith antimicrobial hand sanitisers before they perform \nan examination. This is as important in clinics and \nsurgeries as in hospital wards. Many hospitals now \nhave notices telling patients that they may ask their \ndoctors whether their hands have been washed. The \ndiaphragm and bell of the stethoscope should be cleaned \nwith an antimicrobial wipe (see Fig. 3.1c) and any other \nequipment that touches a patient should be disposable \n(e.g. neurology pin) or wiped down.\nThe examination should not begin until permission \nhas been asked of the patient and the nature of the \nexamination has been explained.\nThe patient must be undressed so that the parts to \nbe examined are accessible. Modesty requires that a \nwoman’s breasts be covered temporarily with a towel \nor sheet while other parts of the body are being \nexamined. Male doctors and students should be \naccompanied by a female chaperone when they examine \na woman’s pelvis, rectum or breasts. Both men and \nwomen should have the groin covered, for example, \nduring examination of the legs. Outpatients should be \nprovided with a gown to wear. However, important \nphysical signs will be missed in some patients if \nexcessive attention is paid to modesty.\nThe position of the patient in bed or elsewhere \nshould depend on what system is to be examined. For \nexample, a patient’s abdomen is best examined if he \nor she lies flat with one pillow placed so that the \nabdominal muscles are relaxed. This is discussed in \ndetail in subsequent chapters.\nWithin each of the examining systems, four \nelements comprise the main parts of the physical \nexamination: looking—inspection, feeling—palpation, \ntapping—percussion, and listening—auscultation.c For \nmany systems a fifth element—assessment of function—\nis added. Measuring is also relevant in some systems. \nEach of these is discussed in detail in the following \nchapters.\nADVANCED CONCEPTS: \nEVIDENCE-BASED CLINICAL \nEXAMINATION\nHistory taking and physical examination are late-comers \nto evidence-based medicine. There are intensive efforts \nin all areas of medicine to base practice on evidence \nof benefit.\nBy their nature, physical signs unless gross have an \nelement of subjectivity and one examiner will not always \nagree with another. For example, the loudness of a \nmurmur or the presence or absence of fingernail changes \nmay be controversial. There are often different accepted \nmethods of assessing the presence or absence of a sign, \nand experienced clinicians may disagree about whether, \nfor example, the apex beat is in the normal position \nor not. Even apparently objective measurements such \nas blood pressure can vary depending on whether \nKorotkoff sound IV or V (p 87) is used, and from \nminute to minute for the same patient. Some physical \nsigns are present only intermittently. The pericardial \nrub may disappear before students can be found to \ncome and listen to it.\nMany of the studies that have examined the reliability \nof physical signs have had problematic variations in \ndisease severity and examiners’ experience.18 This is \nlikely to have led to an underestimation of the reliability \nof signs.\nOne way of looking at the usefulness of a sign \nor a test is to measure or estimate its specificity and \nsensitivity:\n•\t The specificity of a sign is the proportion of \npeople without the disease who do not have the \nsign (‘negative in health’). For example, an 80% \nc\t Infectious diseases doctors add prevent infection transmission (wash hands) \nto these elements.\n",

Table 3.4 lists the sensitivity \nand specificity of some common signs.\nThe likelihood that a test or sign result will be a \ntrue positive or negative depends on the prevalence of \nthe disease in the practice setting (or alternatively, what \nis called the pretest probability of the condition). For \nexample, if splinter haemorrhages (p 80) are found in \nthe nails of a healthy manual labourer they are likely \nto represent a false-positive sign of infective endocarditis. \nThis sign is not very sensitive or specific and in this \ncase the pretest probability of the condition is low. If \nsplinters are found in a sick patient with known valvular \nheart disease and a new murmur, the sign is likely to \nbe a true positive in this patient with a high pretest \nprobability of endocarditis. This pretest probability \nanalysis of the false and true positive rates is based on \nBayes’ theorem.\nA useful way to summarise sensitivity and specificity \nis the likelihood ratio (LR). A positive LR indicates \nthat the presence of a sign is likely to occur that much \nmore often in an individual with the disease than in \none without it. The higher the positive LR, the more \nuseful is a positive sign. A negative likelihood ratio \nincreases the likelihood that the disease is absent if \nthe sign is not present.\n",

For \nexample, the presence of a third heart sound in a patient \nwho might have heart failure (e.g. breathlessness on \nexertion) has a positive LR of 3.8 and a negative LR \naround 1. This means that a third heart sound is specific \nfor heart failure (increases likelihood of the condition \nnearly four times) but not sensitive (the absence of a \nthird heart sound does not reduce the likelihood).\nAll of these figures are calculated on a population \nsuspected of disease; it would be quite incorrect to \napply them to an asymptomatic group of people. Fagan’s \nnomogram (see Fig. 3.19) can be used to apply LRs to \nclinical problems if the pretest probability of the \ncondition is known or can be estimated.

This comprises a series of stations (e.g. 10 minutes \neach) where particular history or physical examination \nskills are tested in front of one or two examiners. \nStudents rotate through all of the stations and each \nstation has different examiners. At each station, after \na stem or introduction has been provided (e.g. patient’s \nname, age and presenting symptom), the task to be \ncompleted is highly specific (e.g. ‘Please take the blood \npressure’). The questions are standardised and preset, \nand the scoring is predetermined, as is (usually) the \npass mark. You gain a mark for each necessary step \nproperly completed (e.g. introducing yourself: 1 mark; \nwashing your hands: 1 mark). This means that you \nmust have a system for examination in the OSCE setting \nand practise it until it becomes second nature.\nAt the end of most chapters of this text a list of \nsample OSCE cases and questions is provided to help \nwith revision and as a preparation guide. Look up the \nanswers in the chapter and use this as a way of revising.\nAt OSCE stations, candidates may be asked to take \na specific history (e.g. the social history) or examine \na particular body system or part (e.g. the praecordium \nfor heart murmurs or the posterior chest for lung signs). \nOther stations, depending on the students’ seniority, \n2.\t Always take the time to make a general \ninspection of the patient.\n3.\t The secret to successful physical examination \n(especially for student exams) is constant \npractice.\n4.\t Position the patient correctly for the \nexamination.\n5.\t Ensure the patient has privacy during the \nexamination.\n6.\t Never hurt the patient during the examination.\n7.\t Hand-washing and cleaning of equipment must \nbe routine.\nmay test clinical skills such as prescription writing. \nEach medical school conducts these exams slightly \ndifferently, but there are certain general principles all \nstudents should understand (if they wish to pass).\nRemember, the ‘patient’ in the exam may be an \nactor trained to answer questions in a certain way. \nActors are also used for the physical examination to test \nthat students complete their techniques properly. The \nidea of using trained actors is that answers to student \nquestions will be standardised. The actor patients often \ncome from local theatrical schools and there is a small \nrisk that they will be tempted to overact (e.g. bursting \ninto tears when asked their age; see Fig. 3.20). The \ngood news is that all candidates will experience the \nsame conditions.\nThere are a number of key points to keep in mind \nduring this ordeal:\n1.\tThe examiners know how difficult it is to \nperform while being watched.\n2.\tTheir expectations are much lower for students \nin their first few years of the course.\n3.\tYou will be given a spoken or written \nintroduction, or both. This will tell you what the \nexaminers expect you to do, so don’t do \nsomething different. For example, if the request \nis to examine the upper limbs of a patient with \nweakness in the arms, don’t begin by testing \nsensation.

This includes \nintroducing yourself and explaining at the start, \nand then with each step, what you are going to \ndo. For example, if asked to examine the patient’s \nabdomen, having introduced yourself, say \nsomething like ‘I have been asked to examine \nyour abdomen. I will need you to lie flat for me \nwith just one pillow. Will you be comfortable like \nthat? I will need to pull your underpants down a \nlittle lower. Is that all right? Are you sore \nanywhere? I’m sorry my hands are a little cold. \nPlease let me know if this is at all uncomfortable \nfor you.’ Make it clear during the examination \nthat you are watching the patient’s face for any \nsign that the examination is painful. This type of \napproach to patients is really only normal \npoliteness and should be routine (i.e. not just \nused during exams).\n6.\tRemember to wash your hands before and after \nfor an easy mark (and in practice you should \nalways do this to protect the patient and you).\nVideo-recorded OSCE examinations are provided \nwith this edition to help guide you further. They are \nmarked with this reference guide from the appropriate \nchapter. There is more help online; for example, search \nfor Wikiversity’s OSCE review or Instamedic.

A change in the pattern \nof onset of previously stable angina must be taken very \nseriously.\nThese features constitute typical angina (see Table \n4.3).3,4 Although angina typically occurs on exertion, \nit may also occur at rest or wake a patient from sleep. \nIschaemic chest pain is usually unaffected by respiration. \nThe use of sublingual nitrates characteristically brings \nrelief within a couple of minutes, but this is not specific \nas nitrates may also relieve oesophageal spasm and \nhave a pronounced placebo effect.\nThe pain associated with an acute coronary \nsyndrome (ST elevation—STEMI, or non-ST elevation—\nnon-STEMI myocardial infarction) often comes on at \nrest, is usually more severe and lasts much longer. \nCertain features make an acute coronary syndrome \nmore likely (Good symptoms guide 4.1).5 Acute \ncoronary syndromes are usually caused by the rupture \nof a coronary artery plaque, which leads to the formation \nof thrombus in the arterial lumen. Stable exertional \nangina is a result of a fixed coronary narrowing.\nPain present for more than half an hour is more \nlikely to be due to an acute coronary syndrome than \nto stable angina, but pain present continuously for many \ndays is unlikely to be either.

The pain is sharp and localised \nto one part of the chest.\nGastro-oesophageal \nreflux \ncommonly \ncauses \nangina-like pain without heartburn. It is important to \nremember that these two relatively common conditions \nmay coexist. Oesophageal spasm may cause retrosternal \nchest pain or discomfort and can be quite difficult to \ndistinguish from angina but is uncommon; the pain \nmay radiate to the jaw and is often relieved by \nswallowing warm water or by the use of nitrates.\nCholecystitis can cause chest pain and be confused \nwith myocardial infarction. Right upper quadrant \nabdominal tenderness is usually present (p 253).\nThe cause of severe, usually unilateral, chest pain \nmay not be apparent until the typical vesicular rash \nof herpes zoster appears in a thoracic nerve root \ndistribution.\nDyspnoea\nShortness of breath may be due to cardiac disease. \nDyspnoea (from the Greek dys ‘bad’, pnoia ‘breathing’) \nis often defined as an unexpected awareness of breathing. \nIt occurs whenever the work of breathing is excessive, \nbut the mechanism is uncertain. It is probably due to \na sensation of increased force required of the respiratory \nmuscles to produce a volume change in the lungs, \nbecause of a reduction in compliance of the lungs or \nincreased resistance to air flow.\nCardiac dyspnoea is typically chronic and occurs with \nexertion because of failure of the left ventricular output \nto rise with exercise; this in turn leads to an acute rise \nin left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, raised \npulmonary venous pressure, interstitial fluid leakage \nand thus reduced lung compliance. However, the \ndyspnoea of chronic cardiac failure does not correlate \nwell with measurements of pulmonary artery pressures, \nand clearly the origin of the symptom of cardiac \ndyspnoea is complicated.6 Left ventricular function may \nbe impaired because of ischaemia (temporary or \npermanent reduction in myocardial blood supply), \nprevious infarction (damage) or hypertrophy (often \nrelated to hypertension). As it becomes more severe, \ncardiac dyspnoea occurs at rest. Cardiac dyspnoea may \nbegin suddenly as a result of myocardial infarction, \nGOOD SYMPTOMS GUIDE 4.1 \n \nClinical factors and positive likelihood ratios \nfor chest pain and diagnosis of an acute \ncoronary syndrome\nSymptom\nLikelihood ratio\nRadiation to right arm or shoulder\n4.7\nTo both arms\n4.1\nHistory of association with exertion\n2.4\nRadiation to left arm\n2.3\nSweating\n2.0\nNausea or vomiting\n1.9\nWorse than previous angina\n1.8\nPressure feeling\n1.3\nKnown abnormal exercise test\n3.1\nPeripheral vascular disease\n2.7\ninflammation of the pleura as a primary problem \n(usually due to viral infection), or secondary to \npneumonia or pulmonary embolism.

It may last only a few seconds or be \npresent for prolonged periods. Disease of the cervical \nor upper thoracic spine may also cause pain associated \nwith movement.

This allows improved overall blood oxygenation. \nPatients with severe orthopnoea spend the night sitting \nup in a chair or propped up on numerous pillows in bed. \nThe absence of orthopnoea suggests that left ventricular \nfailure is unlikely to be the cause of a patient’s dyspnoea \n(negative likelihood ratio [LR] = 0.047).\nParoxysmalb nocturnal dyspnoea (PND) is severe \ndyspnoea that wakes the patient from sleep so that he \nor she is forced to get up gasping for breath. This occurs \nbecause of a sudden failure of left ventricular output \nwith an acute rise in pulmonary venous and capillary \npressures; this leads to transudation of fluid into the \ninterstitial tissues, which increases the work of breathing. \nThe sequence may be precipitated by resorption of \nperipheral oedema at night while supine. Acute cardiac \ndyspnoea may also occur with acute pulmonary oedema \nor a pulmonary embolus.\nCardiac dyspnoea can be difficult to distinguish \nfrom that due to lung disease or other causes (p 165).8 \nOne should enquire particularly about a history of any \ncardiac disease that could be responsible for the onset \nof cardiac failure. For example, a patient with a number \nof known previous myocardial infarctions who develops \ndyspnoea is more likely to have decreased left ventricular \ncontractility. A patient with a history of hypertension or \na very heavy alcohol intake may have hypertensive heart \ndisease or an alcoholic cardiomyopathy. The presence \nof orthopnoea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea is \nmore suggestive of cardiac failure than of lung disease.\nDyspnoea is also a common symptom of anxiety. \nThese patients often describe an inability to take a big \nenough breath to fill the lungs in a satisfying way. Their \nbreathing may be deep and punctuated with sighs.\nAnkle swelling\nThe presence of oedema alone is poorly correlated with \nheart failure (there are many more common causes), \nbut some heart failure patients present with bilateral \nankle swelling due to oedema. Unlike the swelling that \noccurs with inflammatory conditions, the area is not \npainful or red. Patients with the recent onset of oedema \nand who take a serious interest in their weight may \nhave noticed a weight gain of 3 kg or more.\nAnkle oedema of cardiac origin is usually symmetrical \nand worse in the evenings, with improvement during \nthe night. It may be a symptom of biventricular failure \nor right ventricular failure secondary to a number of \npossible underlying aetiologies.

There are usually other symptoms or \nsigns of heart disease.\nIt is important to find out whether the patient is \ntaking a vasodilating drug (e.g. a calcium channel \nblocker), which can cause peripheral oedema.9 There \nare other (more) common causes of ankle oedema than \nheart failure that also need to be considered; see List \n6.2 on p 112). Oedema that affects the face is more \nlikely to be related to kidney disease, from the nephrotic \nsyndrome (p 321).\nPalpitations\nThis is not a very precise term (see Table 4.4). It is \nusually taken to mean an unexpected awareness of the \nheartbeat.10 Ask the patient to describe exactly what \nhe or she notices and whether the palpitations are slow \nor fast, regular or irregular, and how long they last (see \nQuestions box 4.2).\nThere may be the sensation of a missed beat followed \nby a particularly heavy beat; this can be due to an \natrial or ventricular ectopic beat (see the ECG Library \nat \n) (which produces little cardiac \noutput) followed by a compensating pause and then a \nnormally conducted beat (which is more forceful than \nusual because there has been a longer diastolic filling \nperiod for the ventricle).\n",

Exertional syncope may occur \nwith obstruction to left ventricular outflow by aortic \nstenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Profound \nand sudden slowing of the pulse (bradycardia), usually \na result of complete heart block, causes sudden and \nrecurrent syncope (Stokes–Adamsd attackse). These \npatients may have a history of atrial fibrillation. \nTypically they have periods of tachycardia (fast heart \nrate) as well as periods of bradycardia (slow heart rate). \nThis condition is called the sick sinus syndrome. The \npatient must be asked about drug treatment that could \ncause bradycardia (e.g. beta-blockers, digoxin, calcium \nchannel blockers).\nIt is important to ask about a family history of sudden \ndeath. An increasing number of ion channelopathies \nare being identified as a cause of syncope and sudden \ndeath. These rare inherited conditions include the long \nand short QT syndromes and the Brugada syndromef,14 \n(see the ECG Library at \n). They are \noften diagnosed from typical ECG changes.

Dizziness \nthat occurs even when the patient is lying down or \nthat is made worse by movements of the head is more \nlikely to be of neurological origin, although recurrent \ntachyarrhythmias may occasionally cause dizziness in \nany position.

A history \nof claudication suggests peripheral vascular disease \nwith a poor blood supply to the affected muscles. The \nmost important risk factors are smoking, diabetes, \nhypertension and a history of vascular disease elsewhere \nin the body, including cerebrovascular disease and \nischaemic heart disease (see Questions box 4.3). More \nsevere disease causes the feet or legs to feel cold, numb \nand finally painful at rest. Rest pain is a symptom of \nseverely compromised arterial supply. Remember the \nsix Ps of peripheral vascular disease:\nP ain\nP allor\nP ulselessness\nP araesthesias\nP erishingly cold\nP aralysed.\nPopliteal artery entrapment can occur, especially in \nyoung men with intermittent claudication on walking \nbut not running. Also, lumbar spinal stenosis causes \npseudo-claudication: unlike vascular claudication, \nthe pain in the calves is not relieved by standing still, \nbut is relieved by sitting (flexing the spine) and may \nbe exacerbated by extending the spine (e.g. walking \ndownhill).\nRISK FACTORS FOR \nCORONARY ARTERY \nDISEASE\nAn essential part of the cardiac history involves \nobtaining detailed information about a patient’s risk \nfactors—the patient’s cardiovascular risk factor profile \n(see Questions box 4.4).\nPrevious ischaemic heart disease is the most \nimportant risk factor for further ischaemia. The patient \nmay know of previous infarcts or have had a diagnosis \nof angina in the past.\nHypercholesterolaemia is the next most important risk \nfactor for ischaemic heart disease. Many patients now \nknow their serum cholesterol levels because widespread \ntesting has become fashionable. The total serum \ncholesterol is a useful screening test, and levels above \n5.2 mmol / L are considered undesirable. Cholesterol \nmeasurements (unlike triglyceride measurements) are \nQUESTIONS TO ASK THE PATIENT  \nWITH SUSPECTED PERIPHERAL \nVASCULAR DISEASE\n! denotes symptoms for the possible \ndiagnosis of an urgent or dangerous \nproblem.\n1.\t Have you had problems with walking \nbecause of pains in the legs?\n2.\t Where do you feel the pain?\n3.\t How far can you walk before it occurs?\n4.\t Does it make you stop?\n5.\t Does it go away when you stop walking?\n!\t 6.\t Does the pain ever occur at rest? \n(Severe ischaemia may threaten the \nlimb)\n7.\t Have there been changes in the colour \nof the skin over your feet or ankles?\n8.\t Have you had any sores or ulcers on your \nfeet or legs that have not healed?\n9.\t Have you needed treatment of the \narteries of your legs in the past?\n10.\t Have you had diabetes, high blood \npressure or problems with stroke or heart \nattacks in the past?\n11.\t Have you been a smoker?\nQUESTIONS BOX 4.3 \naccurate even when a patient has not been fasting. \nPatients with established coronary artery disease \nbenefit from lowering of total cholesterol to below \n4 mmol / L with the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) of \n1.8 mmol / L or less. An elevated total cholesterol level \nis even more significant if the high-density lipoprotein \n(HDL) level is low (less than 1.0 mmol / L). Significant \nelevation of the triglyceride level is a coronary risk \nfactor in its own right and also adds further to the \nrisk if the total cholesterol is high. If a patient already \nhas coronary disease, hyperlipidaemia is even more \nimportant. Control of risk factors for these patients is \ncalled secondary prevention.

How old were \nthey?\nQUESTIONS BOX 4.4 \nh\t Hypertension is more important as a risk factor for stroke and cholesterol \nfor ischaemic heart disease.\nHypertensionh is another important risk factor for \ncoronary artery disease. Find out when hypertension \nwas first diagnosed and what treatment, if any, has \nbeen instituted (see Questions box 4.4). Treatment \nof hypertension reduces the risk of ischaemic heart \ndisease, hypertensive heart disease, cardiac failure \nand cerebrovascular disease (stroke). Treatment of \nhypertension has also been shown to reverse left \nventricular hypertrophy.\nA family history of coronary artery disease increases \na patient’s risk, particularly if it has been present in \nfirst-degree relatives (parents or siblings) and if it has \naffected these people before the age of 60. Not all heart \ndisease, however, is ischaemic; a patient whose relatives \nsuffered from rheumatic heart disease is at no greater \nrisk of ischaemic heart disease than anybody else.\nA history of diabetes mellitus increases the risk of \nischaemic heart disease very substantially. A diabetic \nwithout a history of ischaemic heart disease has the \nsame risk of myocardial infarction as a non-diabetic \nwho has had an infarct. It is important to find out how \nlong a patient has been diabetic and whether insulin \ntreatment has been required. Good control of the blood \nsugar level in diabetes mellitus may reduce this risk. \nAn attempt should therefore be made to find out how \nwell a patient’s diabetes has been controlled.\nChronic kidney disease is associated with a very high \nrisk of vascular disease. This is possibly related to high \ncalcium-×-phosphate product. The risk may be reduced \nby dietary intervention, ‘phosphate binders’, efficient \ndialysis or renal transplant. Ischaemic heart disease is \nthe most common cause of death in patients with kidney \ndisease on dialysis.\nChronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid \narthritis, psoriasis, poor dentition and gingivitis, and \nHIV infection significantly increase the risk of vascular \ndisease too.\nErectile dysfunction is a sensitive indicator of arterial \nendothelial abnormality and is a risk factor for, or \nindicator of, vascular disease.\nThe presence of multiple risk factors makes control \nof each one more important. Aggressive control of risk \nfactors is often indicated in these patients.\nIt is interesting to note that in the diagnosis of angina \nthe patient’s description of typical symptoms is more \nhigh, it is worth obtaining a dietary history. This can be \nvery trying. It is important to remember that not only \nfoods containing cholesterol but also those containing \nsaturated fats contribute to the serum cholesterol level. \nHigh alcohol consumption and obesity are associated \nwith hypertriglyceridaemia.\nSmoking is probably the next most important \nrisk factor for cardiovascular disease and peripheral \nvascular disease. Some patients describe themselves \nas non-smokers even though they stopped smoking \nonly a few hours ago. The number of years the patient \nhas smoked and the number of cigarettes smoked \nper day are both very important (and are recorded \nas packet-years; p 16). The significance of a history \nof smoking for a patient who has not smoked for \nmany years is controversial. The risk of symptomatic \nischaemic heart disease falls gradually over the years \nafter smoking has been stopped. After about 2 years the \nrisk of myocardial infarction falls to the same level as for \nthose who have never smoked. After 10 years the risk \nof developing angina falls close to that of non-smokers.\n",

Having a level of antibiotics present in the blood at the \ntime of such procedures is thought (but not proven) to prevent \nendocarditis.\ndiscriminating than is the presence of risk factors, which \nonly marginally increase the likelihood that chest pain \nis ischaemic.4 Previous ischaemic heart disease is an \nexception. Certainly a patient who has had angina \nbefore and says he or she has it again is usually right.\nA history of dental decay or infection is important \nfor patients with valvular heart disease, as it puts them \nat risk of infective endocarditis. Ask about the regularity \nof visits to the dentist and the patient’s awareness of \nthe need for antibiotic prophylaxisi before dental (and \nsome surgical) procedures. Cardiac surgeons will not \nreplace heart valves for people with infected teeth or \ngums for fear of infection on the artificial valve.\nDRUG AND TREATMENT \nHISTORY\nThe medications a patient is taking often give a good \nclue to the diagnosis. Find out about any ill-effects from \ncurrent or previous medications. Ask about previous \nprocedures or interventions including angioplasty or \ncoronary artery bypass grafting. If the patient is unable \nto provide a history, a midline sternotomy scar and \nleg scars (consistent with previous saphenous vein \nharvesting) support this diagnosis.\nPatients with heart failure may have been advised \nto restrict their total daily fluid intake. Ask what volume \nhas been recommended (often 1500 mL). They may \nalso have been advised to weigh themselves daily and \nto increase their diuretic drug dose if their weight has \nincreased. Ask what advice has been given about this.\nStreet drug use is relevant. The use of cocaine or \namphetamines is an important cause of myocardial \ninfarction in young people.\nPAST HISTORY\nPatients with a history of definite previous angina or \nmyocardial infarction remain at high risk of further \nischaemic events. It is very useful at this stage to find \nout how a diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease was \nmade and in particular what investigations were \nundertaken. The patient may well remember exercise \ntesting or a coronary angiogram, and some patients \ncan even remember how many coronary arteries were \nnarrowed, and how many coronary bypasses were \nperformed (having more than three grafts often leads \nto a certain amount of boasting). The angioplasty patient \nmay know how many arteries were dilated and whether \nstents (often called coronary stunts by patients and \ncardiac surgeons) were inserted. Acute coronary \nsyndromes are now usually treated with early coronary \nangioplasty.\nPatients may recall a diagnosis of rheumatic fever \nin their childhood, but many were labelled as having \n‘growing pains’.15 A patient who was put to bed for a \nlong period as a child or who received many painful \nbuttock injections (of penicillin) may well have had \nrheumatic fever. A history of chorea (quick abnormal \ninvoluntary dance-like movements; p 600) is strongly \nassociated with rheumatic fever in girls. A history of \nrheumatic fever places patients at risk of rheumatic \nvalvular disease.\nHypertension may be caused or exacerbated by \naspects of the patient’s activities and diet (see Questions \nbox 4.5).

Proper history taking will \ngive the correct diagnosis in many cases and \nindicate the best investigations in others.\n5.\t Assessment of cardiac risk factors takes little time \nand should be routine.\n6.\t Patients know that cardiac disease can be life \nthreatening and that it sometimes causes sudden \ndeath. The history should include sympathetic \nquestions about the effect of the illness.\nuse, lack of exercise, obesity and kidney disease may \nall be factors contributing to high blood pressure. \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause \nsalt and fluid retention and may also worsen blood \npressure. Ask about these, about previous advice to \nmodify these factors and about any drug treatment of \nhypertension when interviewing any patient with high \nblood pressure.\nSOCIAL HISTORY\nBoth ischaemic heart disease and rheumatic heart \ndisease are chronic conditions that may affect a patient’s \nability to function normally. It is therefore important \nto find out whether the patient’s condition has prevented \nhim or her from working and over what period. Patients \nwith severe cardiac failure, for example, may need to \nmake adjustments to their living arrangements so that \nthey are not required to walk up and down stairs at \nhome.\nMost hospitals run cardiac rehabilitation programs \nfor patients with ischaemic heart disease or chronic \nheart failure. They provide exercise classes that help \npatients to regain their confidence and physical fitness, \nalong with information classes about diet and drug \ntreatment, and can help with psychological problems. \nFind out whether the patient has been enrolled in one \nof these and whether it has been helpful. Is this service \nused as a point of contact for the patient if he or she \nhas concerns about new symptoms or the management \nof medications?\nThe return of confidence and self-esteem is a very \nimportant matter for patients and for their families \nafter a life-threatening illness.\nFAMILY HISTORY\nCertain heart diseases are genetic.

THOMAS SYDENHAM\nEXAMINATION ANATOMY\nThe contraction of the heart results in a wringing or \ntwisting movement that is often palpable (the apex \nbeat) and sometimes visible on the part of the chest \nthat lies in front of it—the praecordium.a The passage \nof blood through the heart and its valves and on into \nthe great vessels of the body produces many interesting \nsounds, and causes pulsation in arteries and movement \nin veins in remote parts of the body. Signs of cardiac \ndisease may be found by examining the praecordium \nand the many accessible arteries and veins of the body.\nThe surface anatomy of the heart and of the cardiac \nvalves (see Fig. 5.1) and the positions of the palpable \narteries (see Fig. 5.2) must be kept in mind during the \nexamination of the cardiovascular system. In addition, \nthe physiology of blood flow through the systemic and \npulmonary circuits needs to be understood if the cardiac \ncycle and causes of cardiac murmurs are to be \nunderstood (see Fig. 5.3).\nThe cardiac valves separate the atria from the \nventricles (the atrioventricular [AV] or mitral and \ntricuspid valves) and the ventricles from their \ncorresponding great vessels. Fig. 5.4 shows the fibrous \nskeleton that supports the four valves and their \nappearance during systole (cardiac contraction) and \ndiastole (cardiac relaxation).b\nThe myocardium (cardiac muscle) is supplied by \nthe three coronaryc,1 arteries (see Fig. 5.5). The left \nmain coronary artery arises from the left coronary sinus \nof Valsalva and divides into the left anterior descending \n(LAD) artery, which supplies the anterior wall of the \nheart, and the circumflex (Cx) artery, which supplies \nthe back of the heart. The right coronary artery (RCA) \narises from the right sinus of Valsalva and supplies the \ninferior wall of the left ventricle and the right ventricle. \nThe coronaries are often described as the epicardial \ncoronary arteries. They must run over the surface of \nthe heart or they would be squashed during ventricular \nsystole.\nThe filling of the right side of the heart from the \nsystemic veins can be assessed by inspection of the \njugular veins in the neck (see Fig. 5.6) and by palpation \nof the liver.2 These veins empty into the right atrium.\nThe internal jugular vein is deep in the \nsternocleidomastoid muscle, whereas the external \njugular vein is lateral to it. Traditionally, use of the \nAortic area\nPulmonary area\nMitral area\nTricuspid\narea\nThe areas best suited for auscultation do not \nexactly correlate with the anatomical \nlocation of the valves \nFIGURE 5.1 \na\t This is derived from the plural Latin word praecordia, meaning the parts \nof the body below the heart (the entrails), but also the seat of feelings \nand emotions. In Latin medical writing it means the same as in English: \nthe part of the body over the heart.\nb\t Systole comes from the Greek word meaning a contraction and originally \napplied to a vowel sound usually pronounced long, shortened so as to \nscan. Diastole means the opposite.\nc\t The name is from the Latin corona, which means a garland or crown. The \ncoronaries look like a garland draped over the surface of the heart.\n",

The left-sided \nveins are less accurate because they cross from the left \nside of the chest before entering the right atrium. \nPulsations that occur in the right-sided veins reflect \nmovements of the top of a column of blood that extends \ndirectly into the right atrium. This column of blood \nmay be used as a manometer and enables us to observe \npressure changes in the right atrium. By convention, \nthe sternal angle is taken as the zero point, and the \nmaximum height of pulsations in the internal jugular \nvein, which are visible above this level when the patient \nis at 45°, is measured in centimetres. In the average \nperson, the centre of the right atrium lies 5 centimetres \nbelow this zero point (see Figs 5.6a and 5.7).d,1\nPOSITIONING THE PATIENT\nThe cardiovascular system lends itself particularly well \nto the formal examination approach (see the OCSE \nCVS examination video at \n).

The \ncauses of clubbing are surprisingly varied (see List 5.1). \nThe mechanism is unknown but there are, of course, \nseveral theories. A popular one is that platelet-derived \ngrowth factor (PDGF), released from megakaryocyte \nand platelet emboli in the nail beds, causes fibrovascular \nproliferation. Megakaryocytes and clumps of platelets \ndo not normally reach the arterial circulation. Their \nlarge size (up to 50 µm) prevents their passing through \nthe pulmonary capillaries when they are released from \nthe bone marrow. In conditions where platelets may \nclump in the arterial circulation (infected cardiac valve) \nor bypass the pulmonary capillaries (right-to-left shunt \nassociated with congenital heart disease), they can reach \nthe systemic circulation and become trapped in the \nterminal capillaries of the fingers and toes. Damage to \npulmonary capillaries from various lung disorders can \nhave the same effect.\nProper examination for clubbing involves inspecting \nthe fingernails (and toenails) from the side to determine \nf\t\nJohn Langdon Down (1828–96), Assistant Physician to the London Hospital \nand founder of the Normansfield Mental Hospital.

As the condition advanced, he observed \nthis in his own fingers, only for the space to reappear as he improved.\ni\t\nThis angle can be measured with a shadowgraph, which projects the \nsilhouette of the finger so that it can be measured with a protractor. It \nis not in common use. If the angle is greater than 190°, clubbing is generally \nagreed to be present.\nj\t\nIt is said that gardening is the most common cause of splinter \nhaemorrhages.\nk\t Sir William Osler (1849–1919), a Canadian physician, Professor of Medicine \nat McGill University at 25, and later famous Regius professor of medicine \nat Oxford and renowned medical historian. He was made a baronet. His \nonly son was killed at Ypres.

Schamroth’s sign is the disappearance of the \ndiamond-shaped space that is formed when the nails \nof two similar fingers are held facing each other (see \nFig. 5.11).h One accepted measurement is the \ninterphalangeal depth ratio. The anteroposterior (AP) \ndimension of the finger is measured at the distal \ninterphalangeal joint and compared with the AP \ndiameter at the level of the point where the skin joins \nthe nail. A ratio of more than 1 means clubbing.4,i \nEventually the distal phalanx becomes enlarged, owing \nto soft-tissue swelling. Patients hardly ever notice that \nthey have clubbing, even when it is severe. They often \nexpress surprise at their doctor’s interest in such an \nunlikely part of their anatomy.\nBefore leaving the nails, look for splinter \nhaemorrhages in the nail beds (see Fig. 5.12). These \nare linear haemorrhages lying parallel to the long axis \nof the nail. They are most often due to trauma, \nparticularly in manual workers.j However, an important \ncause is infective endocarditis, which is a bacterial or \nother infection of the heart valves or part of the \nendocardium. In this disease splinter haemorrhages \nare probably the result of a vasculitis in the nail bed, \nbut this is controversial. Other rare causes of splinter \nhaemorrhages include vasculitis as in rheumatoid \narthritis, polyarteritis nodosa or the antiphospholipid \nsyndrome, sepsis elsewhere in the body, haematological \nmalignancy or profound anaemia.\nOsler’sk nodes are a rare manifestation of infective \nendocarditis. These are red, raised, tender palpable \nnodules on the pulps of the fingers (or toes), or on the \nthenar or hypothenar eminences. They are reported \nto have occurred in 50% of patients before antibiotic \ntreatment of endocarditis became available. Currently \n",

The \nnormal resting heart rate in adults is usually said to be \nbetween 60 and 100 beats per minute but a more \nsensible range is probably 55 to 95 (95% of normal \npeople). Bradycardia (from the Greek bradys ‘slow’, \nkardia ‘heart’) is defined as a heart rate of less than 60 \nbeats per minute. Tachycardia (from the Greek tachys \n‘swift’, kardia ‘heart’) is defined as a heart rate over 100 \nbeats per minute (see the OSCE ECGs nos 2, 3 and 4 \nat \n). The causes of bradycardia and \ntachycardia are listed in Table 5.1.\nRhythm\nThe rhythm of the pulse can be regular or irregular. An \nirregular rhythm can be completely irregular with no \npattern (irregularly irregular or chaotic rhythm); this is \nusually due to atrial fibrillation (see Table 5.1). In atrial \nfibrillation coordinated atrial contraction is lost, and \nchaotic electrical activity occurs with bombardment of \nthe atrioventricular node with impulses at a rate of over \n600 per minute. Only a variable proportion of these is \nconducted to the ventricles because (fortunately) the \nAV node is unable to conduct at such high rates. In \nthis way, the ventricles are protected from very rapid \nrates, but beat irregularly, usually at rates between 150 \nand 180 per minute (unless the patient is being treated \nwith drugs to slow the heart rate [see the OCSE ECG \nno. 8 at \n]). The pulse also varies \nin amplitude from beat to beat in atrial fibrillation \nbecause of differing diastolic filling times. This type \nof pulse can occasionally be simulated by frequent \nirregularly occurring supraventricular or ventricular \nectopic beats.\nPatients with atrial fibrillation or frequent ectopic \nbeats may have a detectable pulse deficit. This means \nthat the heart rate when counted by listening to the \nheart with the stethoscope is higher than the rate \nobtained when the radial pulse is counted at the wrist. \nIn these patients the heart sounds will be audible with \nevery systole, but some early contractions preceded \nby short diastolic filling periods will not produce \nenough cardiac output for a pulse to be palpable at \nthe wrist.\nAn irregular rhythm can also be regularly irregular. \nFor example, in patients with sinus arrhythmia the \npulse rate increases with each inspiration and decreases \nwith each expiration (see the OCSE ECG no. 7 at \n); this is a normal finding. It is \nassociated with changes in venous return to the heart.\nPatterns of irregularity (see Fig. 5.16) can also occur \nwhen patients have frequent ectopic beats. These may \narise in the atrium (atrial ectopic beats, AEBs) or in the \nventricle (ventricular ectopic beats, VEBs [see the OCSE \nECG no. 6 at \n]) Ectopic beats quite \ncommonly occur in a fixed ratio to normal beats. When \nevery second beat is an ectopic one, the rhythm is called \nbigeminy. A bigeminal rhythm caused by ectopic beats \nhas a characteristic pattern: normal pulse, weak (or \nabsent) pulse, delay, normal pulse and so on. Similarly, \nevery third beat may be ectopic—trigeminy. A pattern \nof irregularity is also detectable in the Wenckebacho \nphenomenon. Here the AV nodal conduction time \nincreases progressively until a non-conducted atrial \nsystole occurs. Following this, the AV conduction time \nshortens and the cycle begins again.\nRadiofemoral and radial–\nradial delay\nRadiofemoral delay is an important sign, especially in \na young patient with hypertension. While palpating \nthe radial pulse, place the fingers of your other hand \nover the femoral pulse, which is situated below the \ninguinal ligament, one-third of the way up from the \npubic tubercle (see Fig. 5.17). A noticeable delay in \nthe arrival of the femoral pulse wave suggests the \ndiagnosis of coarctation of the aorta, where a congenital \nnarrowing in the aortic isthmus occurs at the level \nwhere the ductus arteriosus joins the descending aorta. \nThis is just distal to the origin of the subclavian artery. \nThis lesion can cause upper limb hypertension.\nYou can palpate both radial pulses together to \ndetect radial–radial inequality in timing or volume, \nwhich is usually due to a large arterial occlusion by an \natherosclerotic plaque or aneurysm, or to subclavian \nartery stenosis on one side. It can also be a sign of \ndissection of the thoracic aorta.\no\t Marel Frederik Wenckebach (1864–1940), a Dutch physician who practised \nin Vienna.

If the arm is too \nhigh—for example, at the level of the supraclavicular \nnotch—the blood pressure reading will be about \n5 mmHg lower; if the arm is too low, the reading will \nbe higher than is accurate.\nFive different sounds will be heard as the cuff is \nslowly released (see Fig. 5.19). These are called the \nKorotkoffq sounds. The pressure at which a sound is \nfirst heard over the artery is the systolic blood pressure \n(Korotkoff I, or KI). As deflation of the cuff continues, \nthe sound increases in intensity (KII), then decreases \n(KIII), becomes muffled (KIV) and disappears (KV). \nDifferent observers have used KIV and KV to indicate \nthe level of the diastolic pressure. KV is probably \nthe best measure. However, this provides a slight \nunderestimate of the arterial diastolic blood pressure. \nAlthough diastolic pressure usually corresponds most \nclosely to KV, in severe aortic regurgitation KIV is a \nmore accurate indication.

The difference \nbetween the two readings represents the level of the \npulsus paradoxus.\nVariations in blood pressure\nWhen blood pressure is measured with an intra-arterial \ncatheter it becomes clear that blood pressure varies \nfrom minute to minute in normal people. Short-term \nchanges of 4 mmHg in the systolic and 3 mmHg in \nthe diastolic readings are common. Hour-to-hour and \nday-to-day variations are even greater.

It takes considerable practice to distinguish \nbetween the different important types of carotid wave \nforms (see Table 5.3). Auscultation of the carotids may \nbe performed now or in association with auscultation \nof the praecordium.\nJugular venous pressure\nJust as the carotid pulse tells us about the aorta and \nleft ventricular function, the JVP (see Fig. 5.6) tells us \nabout right atrial and right ventricular function.2,10,11 \nThe positioning of the patient and lighting are important \nfor this examination to be done properly. The patient \nmust be lying down at 45° to the horizontal with his \nor her head on pillows and in good lighting conditions \n(see Fig. 5.8). It is usual to ask the patient to turn the \nhead slightly to the left so that the base of the neck is \nexposed. However, if the head is turned too far, the \nsternocleidomastoid muscle will contract and obscure \nthe view. This is a difficult examination and there is \nconsiderable inter- (and intra-) observer variation in \nthe findings.\nWhen the patient is lying at 45°, the sternal angle \nis also roughly in line with the base of the neck (see \nFig. 5.6(c)). This provides a convenient zero point from \nwhich to measure the vertical height of the column of \nblood in the jugular vein. The jugular venous pulsation \n(movement) can be distinguished from the arterial pulse \nbecause: (1) it is visible but not palpable and has a more \nprominent inward movement than the artery, (2) it has \na complex wave form, usually seen to flicker twice with \neach cardiac cycle (if the patient is in sinus rhythm), (3) \nit moves on respiration—normally the JVP decreases \non inspiration, and (4) it is at first obliterated and then \nfilled from above when light pressure is applied at the \nbase of the neck.\nJVP must be assessed for height and character. \nWhen the JVP is more than 3 centimetres above the \nzero point, the right-heart filling pressure is raised (a \nnormal reading is less than 8 centimetres of water: \n5 centimetres + 3 centimetres). This is a sign of right \nventricular failure, volume overload or some types of \npericardial disease.\nThe assessment of the character of JVP is difficult, \neven for experienced clinicians.

Most valve surgery requires \ncardiopulmonary bypass and for this a median \nsternotomy (a cut down the middle of the sternum) \nis very commonly used. This type of scar is occasionally \nhidden under a forest of chest hair. It is not specifically \nhelpful, as it may also be a result of previous coronary \nartery bypass grafting. Alternatively, left- or even \nright-sided lateral thoracotomy scars, which may be \nhidden under a pendulous breast, may indicate an \nold (usually more than 30 years old) previous closed \nmitral valvotomy (now very rare). In this operation a \nstenosed mitral valve is opened through an incision \nmade in the left atrial appendage; cardiopulmonary \nbypass is not required. Coronary artery bypass grafting \nand even valve surgery are now sometimes performed \nusing small lateral ‘port’ incisions for video-assisted \ninstruments.\nSkeletal abnormalities such as pectus excavatum \n(funnel chest; p 181) or kyphoscoliosis (from the Greek \nkyphos ‘hunchbacked’, skolios ‘curved’), a curvature \nof the vertebral column, may be present. Skeletal \nabnormalities such as these, which may be part of \nMarfan’s syndrome, can cause distortion of the position \nof the heart and great vessels in the chest and thus \nalter the position of the apex beat. Severe deformity \ncan interfere with pulmonary function and cause \npulmonary hypertension (p 125).\nAnother surgical ‘abnormality’ that must not \nbe missed, if only to avoid embarrassment, is a \npacemaker or cardioverter-defibrillator box (see the \nOCSE ECGs nos 17–19 showing paced rhythm at \n). These are usually under the right \nor left pectoral muscle just below the clavicle, are usually \neasily palpable and obviously metallic. The pacemaker \nleads may be palpable under the skin, leading from \nthe top of the box. The box is normally mobile under \nthe skin. Fixation of the skin to the box or stretching \nof the skin over the box may be an indication for \nrepositioning. Erosion of the box through the skin is a \nserious complication because of the inevitable infection \nthat will occur around this foreign body. Rarely, a loose \nlead connection will lead to twitching of the muscles of \nthe chest wall around the box. Penetration of the right \nventricular lead into or through the right ventricular \nwall may lead to disconcerting paced diaphragmatic \ncontractions (hiccups) at whatever rate the pacemaker \nis set. Defibrillator boxes are larger than pacemakers. \nThey are currently about 10 × 5 centimetres and a little \nless than 1 centimetre thick.\nLook for the apex beat. Its normal position is in \nthe fifth left intercostal space, 1 centimetre medial to \nthe midclavicular line (see Fig. 5.26). It is due primarily \nto recoil of the heart as blood is expelled in systole. \nThere may be other visible pulsations—for example, \nover the pulmonary artery in cases of severe pulmonary \nhypertension.\nPalpation\nPalpate the apex beat (see Fig. 5.27).13 Count down the \nnumber of interspaces (see Fig. 5.26). The first palpable \ninterspace is the second. It lies just below the \nmanubriosternal angle. The position of the apex beat \nis defined as the most lateral and inferior point at which \nthe palpating fingers are raised with each systole. The \nnormal apex is felt over an area the size of a 20 cent \n(50 p) coin. Use firm pressure with the tips of your \nfingers in the rib interspaces.

Jean-Nicholas Corvisant (Napoleon’s \npersonal doctor) was the first to associate abnormal palpation of the \nheart with cardiac chamber enlargements.\nFeeling for the parasternal impulse \nFIGURE 5.28 \nFeeling for the apex beat \nFIGURE 5.27 \nIt is worth noting that the palpable apex beat is not \nthe anatomical apex of the heart but a point above it. \nAt the time the apex beat is palpable,x the heart is \nassuming a more spherical shape and the apex is \ntwisting away from the chest wall. The area above the \napex, however, is moving closer to the chest and is \npalpable. If the apex beat is displaced laterally or \ninferiorly, or both, this usually indicates enlargement,13 \nbut may sometimes be due to chest wall deformity, or \npleural or pulmonary disease (p 182).\nThe character of the apex beat may provide vital \ndiagnostic clues. The normal apex beat gently lifts the \npalpating fingers. There are a number of types of \nabnormal apex beats:\n•\t The pressure loaded (heaving, hyperdynamic or \nsystolic overloaded) apex beat is a forceful and \nsustained impulse. This occurs with aortic \nstenosis or hypertension.\n•\t The volume-loaded (thrusting) apex beat is a \ndisplaced, diffuse, non-sustained impulse. This \noccurs most commonly in advanced mitral \nregurgitation or dilated cardiomyopathy.\n•\t The dyskinetic apex beat is an uncoordinated \nimpulse felt over a larger area than normal in the \npraecordium and is usually due to left ventricular \ndysfunction (e.g. in anterior myocardial \ninfarction).\n•\t The double-impulse apex beat, where two \ndistinct impulses are felt with each systole, is \ncharacteristic of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \n(p 137).\n•\t The tapping apex beat will be felt when the first \nheart sound is actually palpable (heart sounds \nare not palpable in health) and indicates mitral \nor very rarely tricuspid stenosis.\nThe character, but not the position, of the apex beat \nmay be more easily assessed when the patient lies on \nthe left side.\nIn many patients the apex beat may not be palpable. \nThis is most often due to a thick chest wall, emphysema, \npericardial effusion, shock (or death) and rarely to \ndextrocardia (where there is inversion of the heart and \ngreat vessels). The apex beat will be palpable to the \nright of the sternum in many cases of dextrocardia.\nOther praecordial impulses may be palpable in \npatients with heart disease. A parasternal impulse may \nbe felt when the heel of the hand is rested just to the \nleft of the sternum with the fingers lifted slightly off \nthe chest (see Fig. 5.28). Normally no impulse or a \nslight inward impulse is felt. In cases of right ventricular \nenlargement or severe left atrial enlargement, where \nthe right ventricle is pushed anteriorly, the heel of the \nhand is lifted off the chest wall with each systole. \nPalpation with the fingers over the pulmonary area \nmay reveal the palpable tap of pulmonary valve closure \n",

These \npalpable murmurs are called thrills. The praecordium \nshould be systematically palpated for thrills with the \nflat of the hand, first over the apex and left sternal \nedge, and then over the base of the heart (this is the \nupper part of the chest and includes the aortic and \npulmonary areas; see Fig. 5.29).\nApical thrills can be more easily felt with the patient \nrolled over to the left side (the left lateral position) as \nthis brings the apex closer to the chest wall. Thrills are \nbest felt with the patient sitting up, leaning forwards \nand in full expiration. In this position the base of the \nheart is moved closer to the chest wall. A thrill that \ncoincides in time with the apex beat is called a systolic \nthrill; one that does not coincide with the apex beat is \ncalled a diastolic thrill.\nThe presence of a thrill usually indicates a severe \nvalve lesion. Careful palpation for thrills is a useful, but \noften neglected, part of the cardiovascular examination.\nPercussion\nIt is possible to define the cardiac outline by means \nof percussion,y but this is not routinely performed \n(p 184).14 Percussion is most accurate when performed \nin the fifth intercostal space. The patient should lie \nsupine and the examiner percusses from the anterior \naxillary line towards the sternum. The point at which \nthe percussion note becomes dull represents the left \nheart border. A distance of more than 10.5 centimetres \nbetween the border of the heart and the middle of the \nsternum indicates cardiomegaly. The sign is not useful \nin the presence of lung disease.\nAuscultation\nNow at last the stethoscope is required.15 However, in \nsome cases the diagnosis should already be fairly clear. \nIn the viva voce and OSCE examination, the examiners \nwill occasionally amuse themselves by stopping a \ncandidate before auscultation and ask for an opinion.\nAuscultation of the heart (reference to heart sounds \nrecordings) begins in the mitral area with the bell of \nthe stethoscope (see Figs 5.1 and 5.30). The bell is \ndesigned as a resonating chamber and is particularly \nefficient in amplifying low-pitched sounds, such as the \ndiastolic murmur of mitral stenosis or a third heart \nsound. It must be applied lightly to the chest wall, \nbecause forceful application will stretch the skin under \nthe bell so that it forms a diaphragm.

This can be obtained only through \nconstant practice. Auscultation of the normal heart \nreveals two sounds called, not surprisingly, the first \nand second heart sounds.

Because the pulmonary \ncomponent of the second heart sound (P2) may not \nbe audible throughout the praecordium, splitting of \nthe second heart sound may best be appreciated in \nthe pulmonary area and along the left sternal edge. \nPulmonary valve closure is further delayed (by 20 or \n30 milliseconds) with inspiration because of increased \nvenous return to the right ventricle; thus, splitting of \nthe second heart sound is wider on inspiration. The \nsecond heart sound marks the beginning of diastole, \nwhich is usually longer than systole.\nIt can be difficult to decide which heart sound is \nwhich. Palpation of the carotid pulse will indicate the \ntiming of systole and enable the heart sounds to be \nmore easily distinguished. It is obviously crucial to \ndefine systole and diastole during auscultation so that \ncardiac murmurs and abnormal sounds can be placed \nin the correct part of the cardiac cycle. Students are \noften asked to time a cardiac murmur; this is not a \nrequest to measure its length, but rather to say in which \npart of the cardiac cycle it occurs. Even the experts \ncan mistake a murmur if they do not time it. It is \nimportant, during auscultation, to concentrate separately \non the components of the cardiac cycle: attempt to \nidentify each and listen for abnormalities. There can \nbe more than 12 components to identify in patients \nwith heart disease. An understanding of the cardiac \ncycle is helpful when interpreting the auscultatory \nfindings (see Fig. 5.34).\nAbnormalities of the \nheart sounds\nAlterations in intensity\nThe first heart sound (S1) is loud when the mitral or \ntricuspid valve cusps remain wide open at the end of \ndiastole and shut forcefully with the onset of ventricular \nsystole. This occurs in mitral stenosis because the \nnarrowed valve orifice limits ventricular filling so that \nthere is no diminution in flow towards the end of \ndiastole. The normal mitral valve cusps drift back \ntowards the closed position at the end of diastole as \nventricular filling slows down. Other causes of a loud \nS1 are related to reduced diastolic filling time (e.g. \ntachycardia or any cause of a short atrioventricular \nconduction time).\nSoft first heart sounds can be due to a prolonged \ndiastolic filling time (as with first-degree heart block) \nor a delayed onset of left ventricular systole (as with \nleft bundle branch block), or to failure of the leaflets \nto coapt normally (as in mitral regurgitation).\nThe second heart sound (S2) may have a loud aortic \ncomponent (A2) in patients with systemic hypertension. \nThis results in forceful aortic valve closure secondary \nto high aortic pressures. Congenital aortic stenosis \nis another cause, because the valve is mobile but \nnarrowed and closes suddenly at the end of systole. \nThe pulmonary component of the second heart sound \n(P2) is traditionally said to be loud in pulmonary \nhypertension, where the valve closure is forceful because \nof the high pulmonary pressure. In fact, a palpable P2 \ncorrelates better with raised pulmonary pressures than a \nloud P2.16\nA soft A2 will be found when the aortic valve is \ncalcified and leaflet movement is reduced, and in aortic \nregurgitation when the leaflets cannot coapt.\nSplitting\nSplitting of the heart sound is usually most obvious \nduring auscultation in the pulmonary area. Splitting \nof the first heart sound is usually not detectable \nclinically; however, when it occurs it is most often due \nto the cardiac conduction abnormality known as \ncomplete right bundle branch block (see the OCSE \nECG library no. 22 at \n).\nIncreased normal splitting (wider on inspiration) \nof the second heart sound occurs when there is any \ndelay in right ventricular emptying, as in right bundle \nbranch block (delayed right ventricular depolarisation), \npulmonary stenosis (delayed right ventricular ejection), \nventricular septal defect (increased right ventricular \nvolume load) and mitral regurgitation (because of earlier \naortic valve closure, due to more rapid left ventricular \nemptying).\nIn the case of fixed splitting of the second heart \nsound, there is no respiratory variation (as is normal) \nand splitting tends to be wide. This is caused by an \natrial septal defect where equalisation of volume loads \nbetween the two atria occurs through the defect. This \nresults in the atria acting as a common chamber.\nReversed splitting is present when P2 occurs first \nand splitting occurs in expiration. This can be due \nto delayed left ventricular depolarisation (left bundle \nbranch block [see the OCSE ECG library no. 23 at \n",

It is more likely to be \nappreciated if the clinician listens not to the individual \nheart sounds but to the rhythm of the heart. It is \nprobably caused by tautening of the mitral or tricuspid \npapillary muscles at the end of rapid diastolic filling, \nwhen blood flow temporarily stops.\nA pathological S3 is due to reduced ventricular \ncompliance, so that a filling sound is produced even \nwhen diastolic filling is not especially rapid. It is strongly \nassociated with increased atrial and ventricular \nend-diastolic pressure.\nA left ventricular S3 is louder at the apex than at \nthe left sternal edge, and is louder on expiration. It can \nbe physiological when it is due to very rapid diastolic \nfilling, associated with an increased cardiac output, as \noccurs in pregnancy and thyrotoxicosis and in some \nchildren. Otherwise, it is an important sign of left \nventricular failure and dilation, but may also occur in \naortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, ventricular \nseptal defect and patent ductus arteriosus.18\nA new third heart sound after a myocardial \ninfarction is an indicator of increased mortality risk \n(LR+, 8.0).19\nA right ventricular S3 is louder at the left sternal \nedge and with inspiration. It occurs in right ventricular \nfailure or constrictive pericarditis.\nThe fourth heart sound (S4) is a late diastolic sound \npitched slightly higher than the S3.20 The cadence of \nan S4 is similar to that of the word ‘Tennessee’. Again, \nthis is responsible for the impression of a triple (gallop) \nrhythm. It is due to a high-pressure atrial wave reflected \nback from a poorly compliant ventricle. It does not \noccur if the patient is in atrial fibrillation, because the \nsound depends on effective atrial contraction, which is \nlost when the atria fibrillate. Its low pitch means that, \nunlike a split first heart sound, it disappears if the bell \nof the stethoscope is pressed firmly onto the chest.\nA left ventricular S4 may be audible when \nleft ventricular compliance is reduced owing to \naortic stenosis, acute mitral regurgitation, systemic \nhypertension, ischaemic heart disease or advanced age. \nIt is sometimes present during an episode of angina \nor with a myocardial infarction, and may be the only \nphysical sign of that condition.\nA right ventricular S4 occurs when right ventricular \ncompliance is reduced as a result of pulmonary \nhypertension or pulmonary stenosis.\nIf the heart rate is greater than 120 beats per \nminute, S3 and S4 may be superimposed, resulting in \na summation gallop. In this case, two inaudible sounds \nmay combine to produce an audible one. This does not \nnecessarily imply ventricular stress, unless one or both \nof the extra heart sounds persists when the heart rate \nslows or is slowed by carotid sinus massage. When both \nS3 and S4 are present, the rhythm is described as a \nquadruple rhythm. It usually implies severe ventricular \ndysfunction.\nAdditional sounds\nAn opening snap is a high-pitched sound that occurs \nin mitral stenosis at a variable distance after S2. It is \ndue to the sudden opening of the mitral valve and is \nfollowed by the diastolic murmur of mitral stenosis. \nIt can be difficult to distinguish from a widely split \nS2, but normally occurs rather later in diastole than \nthe pulmonary component of the second heart sound. \nIt is pitched higher than a third heart sound and so \nis not usually confused with this. It is best heard at \nthe lower left sternal edge with the diaphragm of the \nstethoscope. Use of the term opening snap implies \nthe diagnosis of mitral stenosis or, rarely, tricuspid \nstenosis.\nA systolic ejection click is an early systolic \nhigh-pitched sound that is heard over the aortic or \npulmonary and left sternal edge areas, and that may \noccur in cases of congenital aortic or pulmonary stenosis \nwhere the valve remains mobile; it is followed by the \nsystolic ejection murmur of aortic or pulmonary \nstenosis. It is due to the abrupt doming of the abnormal \nvalve early in systole.\nA non-ejection systolic click is a high-pitched \nsound heard during systole that is best appreciated \nat the mitral area. It is a common finding. It may be \nfollowed by a systolic murmur. The click may be due \nto prolapse of one or more redundant mitral valve \nleaflets during systole. Non-ejection clicks may also be \nheard in patients with atrial septal defects or Ebstein’s \nanomaly (p 141).\nAn atrial myxomaz is a very rare tumour that may \noccur in either atrium.

This sound is only \nrarely heard, even in patients with a myxoma (about \n10%).\nA diastolic pericardial knock may occur when there \nis sudden cessation of ventricular filling because of \nconstrictive pericardial disease.21\nProsthetic heart valves produce characteristic \nsounds (p 138).22 Rarely, a right ventricular pacemaker \nproduces a late diastolic high-pitched click due to \ncontraction of the chest wall muscles (the pacemaker \nsound).\nMurmurs of the heart\nMurmurs are continuous sounds caused by turbulent \nblood flow. Some turbulence is inevitable as the blood \nis accelerated through the aortic and pulmonary valves \nduring ventricular systole. Increased turbulence across \nnormal valves occurs in association with anaemia and \nthyrotoxicosis. The normal velocity of flow through \nthese valves is about 1 metre per second. This may \nbe enough to produce a soft swishing sound audible \nwith the stethoscope, an innocent murmur. Greater \nturbulence—flow velocities of 4 metres per second or \nmore across narrowed aortic valves and even higher \nvelocities when the mitral valve leaks—lead to more \nprominent murmurs. Certain features have been shown \nto indicate a likelihood that a murmur is significant \n(see Good signs guide 5.1aa).\nIn deciding the origin of a cardiac murmur, a \nnumber of different features must be considered. These \nare: associated features (peripheral signs), timing, \nthe area of greatest intensity and radiation (see Fig. \n5.35), the loudness and pitch and the effect of dynamic \nmanoeuvres, including respiration and the Valsalva \nmanoeuvre. The presence of a characteristic murmur \nis very reliable for the diagnosis of certain valvular \nabnormalities, but for others less so.\nAssociated features\nAs already mentioned, the cause of a cardiac murmur \ncan sometimes be elicited by careful analysis of the \nperipheral signs.\nTiming\nSystolic murmurs (which occur during ventricular \nsystole) may be pansystolic, midsystolic (ejection \nsystolic) or late systolic (see Table 5.4).\nThe pansystolic murmur extends throughout systole, \nbeginning with the first heart sound and going right \nup to the second heart sound. Its loudness and pitch \ndo not vary during systole. Pansystolic murmurs occur \nwhen a ventricle leaks to a lower-pressure chamber \nor vessel. As there is a pressure difference from the \nmoment the ventricle begins to contract (S1), blood \nflow and the murmur both begin at the first heart sound \nand continue until the pressures equalise (S2). Causes \nof pansystolic murmurs include mitral regurgitation,bb \ntricuspid regurgitation, ventricular septal defect and \naortopulmonary shunts.\nThe midsystolic ejection murmur does not begin \nright at the first heart sound; its intensity is greatest \nin midsystole or later, and wanes again late in systole. \nThis is described as a crescendo–decrescendo murmur. \nThese murmurs are usually produced by turbulent flow \nthrough the aortic or pulmonary valve orifices or by \ngreatly increased flow through a normal-sized orifice \nor outflow tract. Causes include aortic or pulmonary \nstenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and atrial septal \ndefect.\nWhen it is possible to distinguish an appreciable gap \nbetween the first heart sound and the murmur, which \nthen continues right up to the second heart sound, \nbb\t The older term incompetence is synonymous with regurgitation, but the \nlatter better describes the pathophysiology and changes to terminology \nof this sort keep non-cardiologists on the back foot.\n",

They are more difficult for students \nto hear than systolic murmurs and are usually softer. \nA loud murmur is unlikely to be diastolic.\nThe early diastolic murmur begins immediately \nwith the second heart sound and has a decrescendo \nquality (it is loudest at the beginning and extends for \na variable distance into diastole). These early diastolic \nmurmurs are typically high-pitched and are due to \nregurgitation through leaking aortic or pulmonary \nvalves. The murmur is loudest at the beginning because \nthis is when aortic and pulmonary artery pressures are \nhighest.\nThe mid-diastolic murmur begins later in diastole \nand may be short or extend right up to the first heart \nsound. It has a much lower-pitched quality than early \ndiastolic murmurs. It is due to impaired flow during \nventricular filling and can be caused by mitral stenosis \nand tricuspid stenosis, where the valve is narrowed, or \nrarely by an atrial myxoma, where the tumour mass \nobstructs the valve orifice, or mitral valvulitis from \nacute rheumatic fever.\nIn severe aortic regurgitation, the regurgitant jet \nfrom the aortic valve may cause the anterior leaflet of \nthe mitral valve to shudder, producing a diastolic \nmurmur. Occasionally, normal mitral or tricuspid valves \ncan produce flow murmurs, which are short and \nmid-diastolic, and occur when there is torrential flow \nacross the valve. Causes include a high cardiac output \nor intracardiac shunting (atrial or ventricular septal \ndefects).\nThe presystolic murmur may be heard when atrial \nsystole increases blood flow across the valve just \nbefore the first heart sound. It is an extension of the \nmid-diastolic murmurs of mitral stenosis, tricuspid \nstenosis and atrial myxoma, and usually does not occur \nwhen atrial systole is lost in atrial fibrillation.\nAs the name implies, continuous murmurs extend \nthroughout systole and diastole. They are produced \nwhen a communication exists between two parts of \nthe circulation with a permanent pressure gradient so \nthat blood flow occurs continuously. They can usually \nbe distinguished from combined systolic and diastolic \nmurmurs (due, for example, to aortic stenosis and aortic \n",

The \nvarious causes are presented in Table 5.4.\nA pericardial friction rub is a superficial scratching \nsound; there may be up to three distinct components \noccurring at any time during the cardiac cycle. They \nare not confined to systole or diastole. A rub is caused \nby movement of inflamed pericardial surfaces; it is \na result of pericarditis. The sound can vary with \nrespiration and posture; it is often louder when the \npatient is sitting up and breathing out. It tends to come \nand go, and is often absent by the time students can \nbe found to come and listen for it. It has been likened \nto the crunching sound made when walking on snow.\nA mediastinal crunch (Hamman’scc sign) is a \ncrunching sound heard in time with the heartbeat but \nwith systolic and diastolic components. It is caused by \nthe presence of air in the mediastinum, and once heard \nit is not forgotten. It is very often present after cardiac \nsurgery and may occur associated with a pneumothorax \nor after aspiration of a pericardial effusion (if air has \nbeen let into the pericardium).\nArea of greatest intensity\nAlthough the place on the praecordium where a \nmurmur is heard most easily is a guide to its origin, \nthis is not a particularly reliable physical sign. For \nexample, mitral regurgitation murmurs are usually \nloudest at the apex, over the mitral area, and tend to \nradiate towards the axillae (see Fig. 5.35, Good signs \nguide 5.2), but they may be heard widely over the \npraecordium and even right up into the aortic area or \nover the back. Conduction of an ejection murmur up \ninto the carotid arteries strongly suggests that this arises \nfrom the aortic valve.\nLoudness and pitch\nThe loudness of the murmur may be helpful in deciding \nthe severity of the valve lesion; for example, for mitral \nregurgitation (see Good signs guide 5.3).23\nThe loudness and harshness of the murmur (and \nthe presence of a thrill) correlate with the severity of \naortic stenosis except in the severest forms of valve \nstenosis, when murmurs may be soft because cardiac \noutput has fallen.

He described his manoeuvre in 1704. Forced \nexpiration against the closed glottis causes discharge of pus into the \nexternal auditory canal in cases of chronic otitis media. Friedrich Weber \nrediscovered the manoeuvre in 1859 and demonstrated that he could \nslow his pulse at will. He stopped demonstrating this after he caused \nhimself to faint and have convulsions.\nDynamic auscultation for aortic regurgitation \nor a pericardial friction rub; the patient sitting \nup in deep expiration \nFIGURE 5.37 \nreduced, the systolic murmur of hypertrophic \ncardiomyopathy becomes louder and the systolic \nclick and murmur of mitral valve prolapse begin \nearlier. In phase 3 (the release of the manoeuvre), \nfirst right-sided and then left-sided cardiac \nmurmurs become louder briefly before returning \nto normal. Blood pressure falls further because of \npooling of blood in the pulmonary veins. In \nphase 4, the blood pressure overshoots as a result \nof increased sympathetic activity as a response to \nthe previous hypotension. Changes in heart rate \nare opposite to the blood pressure changes.\n•\t Standing to squatting: when the patient squats \nrapidly from the standing position, venous \nreturn and systemic arterial resistance increase \nsimultaneously, causing a rise in stroke volume \nand arterial pressure. This makes most murmurs \nlouder. However, left ventricular size is increased, \nwhich reduces the obstruction to outflow and \ntherefore reduces the intensity of the systolic \nmurmur of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, while \nthe midsystolic click and murmur of mitral valve \nprolapse are delayed.\n•\t Squatting to standing: when the patient stands \nup quickly after squatting, the opposite changes \nin the loudness of these murmurs occur.\n•\t Isometric exercise: sustained handgrip or \nrepeated sit-ups for 20–30 seconds increases \nsystemic arterial resistance, blood pressure and \nheart size. The systolic murmur of aortic stenosis \nmay become softer because of a reduction in the \npressure difference across the valve but often \nremains unchanged. Most other murmurs \nbecome louder, except the systolic murmur of \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is softer, \nand the mitral valve prolapse murmur, which is \ndelayed because of an increased ventricular \nvolume.\nAuscultation of the neck\nThis is often performed as a part of dynamic auscultation \nfor valvular heart disease, but certain aspects of the \nexamination may be considered here. Abnormal sounds \nheard over the arteries are called bruits. These sounds \nare low-pitched and may be more easily heard with \nthe bell of the stethoscope. Carotid artery bruits are \nmost easily heard over the anterior part of the \nof a pericardial friction rub is also best heard in \nthis position.\n•\t The Valsalva manoeuvre:dd this is forceful \nexpiration against a closed glottis. Ask the \npatient to hold his or her nose with the fingers, \nclose the mouth, breathe out hard and \ncompletely so as to pop the eardrums, and hold \nthis for as long as possible. Listen over the left \nsternal edge during this manoeuvre for changes \nin the systolic murmur of hypertrophic \ncardiomyopathy, and over the apex for changes \nwhen mitral valve prolapse is suspected.\nThe Valsalva manoeuvre has four phases. In \nphase 1 (beginning the manoeuvre), a rise in \nintrathoracic pressure and a transient increase in \nleft ventricular output and blood pressure occur. \nIn phase 2 (the straining phase), systemic venous \nreturn falls, filling of the right and then the left \nside of the heart is reduced, and stroke volume \nand blood pressure fall while the heart rate \nincreases.

Ask the patient to stop breathing \nfor a brief period to remove the competing noise of \nbreath sounds. It may be prudent to ask the patient \nnot to speak. The amplified voice is often painfully \nloud when heard through the stethoscope.\nA systolic bruit may be a conducted sound from the \nheart. The murmur of aortic stenosis is always audible in \nthe neck and a soft carotid bruit is sometimes audible in \npatients with severe mitral regurgitation or pulmonary \nstenosis. A bruit due to carotid stenosis will not be \naudible over the base of the heart. Move the stethoscope \nfrom point to point onto the chest wall; if the bruit \ndisappears, it is likely the sound arises from the carotid. \nIt is not possible to exclude a carotid bruit in a patient \nwith a murmur of aortic stenosis that radiates to the \nneck. Carotid artery stenosis is an important cause of \na carotid bruit.\nMore severe stenosis is associated with a noise that \nis longer and of increased pitch. Total obstruction of \nthe vessel leads to disappearance of the bruit. It is not \npossible to exclude significant (>60% obstruction) \ncarotid stenosis clinically. The upshot is that a carotid \nbruit poorly predicts significant carotid stenosis or \nstroke risk.\nThyrotoxicosis can result in a systolic bruit due to \nthe increased vascularity of the gland. \nA continuous noise is sometimes audible at the \nbase of the neck. This is usually a venous hum, a result \nof audible venous flow. It disappears if light pressure \nis applied to the neck just above the stethoscope. \nHaemodialysis patients frequently have an audible bruit \ntransmitted from their arteriovenous fistula.\nTHE BACK\nIt is now time to leave the praecordium. Percussion \nand auscultation of the lung bases (Ch 10) are also part \nof the cardiovascular examination. Signs of cardiac \nfailure may be detected in the lungs; in particular late \nor pan-inspiratory crackles or a pleural effusion may \nbe present. The murmur associated with coarctation \nof the aorta may be prominent over the upper back.\nWhile the patient is sitting up, feel for pitting \noedema of the sacrum, which occurs in severe right \nheart failure, especially in patients who have been in \nbed.26 This is because the sacrum then becomes a \ndependent area and oedema fluid tends to settle under \nthe influence of gravity.\nTHE ABDOMEN AND LEGS\nLay the patient down flat (on one pillow) and examine \nthe abdomen (Ch 14). You are looking particularly for \nan enlarged tender liver, which may be found when \nthe hepatic veins are congested in the presence of right \nheart failure. Distension of the liver capsule is said to \nbe the cause of liver tenderness in these patients. When \ntricuspid regurgitation is present the liver may be \npulsatile, as the right ventricular systolic pressure wave \nis transmitted to the hepatic veins—this is a very reliable \nsign. Test for hepatojugular reflux.12,27 Ascites may occur \nwith severe right heart failure. Splenomegaly, if present, \nmay indicate infective endocarditis.\nFeel for the pulsation of the abdominal aorta, to \nthe left of the middle line. It is often palpable in normal \nthin people but the possibility of an abdominal aortic \naneurysm should always be considered when the aorta’s \npulsations are palpable and expansile.28,29\nThe cardiovascular examination is not complete \nuntil the legs have been examined (in particular test \nfor pitting ankle oedema) as set out in Chapter 6.\n",

Figs 5.2 and 6.1 show their basic anatomy.\nArms\nMost of the blood supply of the arm is provided by \nthe axillary artery, which, after giving off some small \nbranches in the upper arm, becomes the brachial artery. \nThis divides into the radial and ulnar arteries, which \nrun down the forearm following their bones. Both \ncontinue to the wrist where they go on to supply the \nhands and fingers. The radial artery is very superficial \nat the wrist and easily palpable. The veins of the arm \ninclude the digital veins of the hands, the cephalic and \nmedian vein of the forearm and the basilica vein, which \nruns the whole length of the arm. In the upper arm \nthe brachial and cephalic veins run to the shoulder. \nThese veins drain via the axillary vein into the superior \nvena cava.\nLegs\nThe main blood supply to the leg is from the external \niliac artery, which becomes the femoral artery in the \ngroin. Its main branches are the profunda femoris (deep \nfemoral) artery in the thigh and the anterior and \nposterior tibial arteries in the lower leg. The posterior \ntibial artery is usually palpable behind the medial \nmalleolus and the continuation of the anterior tibial—\nthe dorsalis pedis is palpable over the dorsum of the \nfoot. The veins of the leg include the longest vein in \nthe body: the great saphenous vein. This superficial \nvein drains via perforating veins to the deep veins, \nwhich contain valves assisting return of blood to the \nheart. Damage to these valves, for example by venous \nthromboses, can lead to venous varicosities. The leg \nveins drain into the external iliac veins and then into \nthe inferior vena cava.\nLower limbs\nSee List 6.1 and Fig. 6.2. Palpate behind the medial \nmalleolus of the tibia and the distal shaft of the tibia \nfor oedema by compressing the area for at least 15 \nseconds with the thumb. This latter area is often tender \nin normal people, and gentleness is necessary. Oedema \noccurs when fluid leaks from capillaries into the \ninterstitial space. There are a number of causes. Oedema \nmay be pitting (the skin is indented and only slowly \nrefills—Fig. 6.3) or non-pitting. Oedema due to \nhypoalbuminaemia often refills more quickly.1\nThe oedema that occurs in cardiac failure is pitting \nunless the condition has been present for a long time \nand secondary changes in the lymphatic vessels have \noccurred. If oedema is present, note its upper level \n(e.g. ‘pitting oedema to mid-calf’ or ‘pitting oedema \nto mid-thigh’). Severe oedema can involve the skin of \nthe abdominal wall and the scrotum as well as the \nlower limbs. Oedema secondary to fluid retention \nsuggests about 6 litres or more is retained. Differential \ndiagnosis and causes of oedema are listed in Lists 6.2 \nand 6.3 respectively.\nNon-pitting oedema suggests chronic lymphoedema \nthat is due to lymphatic obstruction (see Fig. 6.4). \nMyxoedema that occurs in thyroid disease is due to the \naccumulation of hydrophilic molecules in subcutaneous \ntissue.\n",

A bruit may be heard if the artery \nis narrowed. Next palpate the following pulses: popliteal \n(behind the knee—see Fig. 6.5(a): if this is difficult to \nfeel when the patient is supine, try the method shown \nin Fig. 6.5(b)), posterior tibial (under the medial \nmalleolus, see Fig. 6.6(a)) and dorsalis pedis (on the \nforefoot, Fig. 6.6(b)) on both sides.2\nPatients with exertional calf pain (intermittent \nclaudication) are likely to have disease of the peripheral \narteries. More severe disease can lead to pain even \nat rest and to ischaemic changes in the legs and feet \n(see Good signs guide 6.1). Look for atrophic skin \nand loss of hair, colour changes of the feet (blue or \nred) and ulcers at the lower end of the tibia.3 Venous \nand diabetic ulcers can be distinguished from arterial \nulcers (see Figs 6.7–6.9).\nLook for reduced capillary return (compress the \ntoenails—the return of the normal red colour is slow).4 \nIn such cases, perform Buerger’sb test to help confirm \nyour diagnosis: elevate the legs to 45° (pallor is rapid \nif there is a poor arterial supply), then place them \ndependent at 90° over the edge of the bed (cyanosis \noccurs if the arterial supply is impaired).

On \nexamination, the clinician should look for swelling of \nthe calf and the thigh, and dilated superficial veins. \nFeel then for increased warmth and squeeze the calf \n(gently) to determine whether the area is tender. \nHomans’ c sign (pain in the calf when the foot is sharply \ndorsiflexed, i.e. pushed up) is of limited diagnostic value \nand is theoretically dangerous because of the possibility \nof dislodgement of loose thrombus.\nThe causes of thrombosis were described by \nVirchowd in 1856 under three broad headings (the \nfamous Virchow’s triad):\n1.\tchanges in the vessel wall\n2.\tchanges in blood flow\n3.\tchanges in the constitution of the blood.\nDeep venous thrombosis is usually caused by \nprolonged immobilisation (particularly after lower \nlimb orthopaedic surgery), cardiac failure (stasis) \nor trauma (vessel wall damage), but may also result \nfrom neoplasm, sepsis, chronic inflammatory bowel \ndisease, disseminated intravascular coagulation, \nthe contraceptive pill, pregnancy and a number of \ninherited defects of coagulation (the thrombophilias: \ne.g. antithrombin III deficiency or the factor V Leiden \nmutation).\nVARICOSE VEINS\nIf a patient complains of ‘varicose veins’, ask him or \nher to stand with the legs fully exposed.8 Inspect the \nfront of the whole leg for tortuous, dilated branches \nof the long saphenous vein (below the femoral vein in \nthe groin to the medial side of the lower leg). Then \ninspect the back of the calf for varicosities of the short \nsaphenous vein (from the back of the calf and lateral \nmalleolus to the popliteal fossa). Look to see whether \nc\t John Homans (1877–1954), a professor of surgery at Harvard University, \nBoston.

Hard leg veins suggest thrombosis, \nwhereas tenderness indicates thrombophlebitis. Perform \nthe cough impulse test. Put the fingers over the long \nsaphenous vein opening in the groin, medial to the \nfemoral vein. (Do not forget the anatomy—femoral \nvein [medial], artery [your landmark], nerve [lateral].) \nAsk the patient to cough: a fluid thrill is felt if the \nsaphenofemoral valve is incompetent.\nThe following supplementary tests are occasionally \nhelpful (and surgeons like to quiz students on them \nin examinations):\n•\t Trendelenburge test: with the patient lying down, \nthe leg is elevated. Firm pressure is placed on the \nsaphenous opening in the groin, and the patient \nis instructed to stand. The sign is positive if the \nveins stay empty until the groin pressure is \nreleased (incompetence at the saphenofemoral \nvalve). If the veins fill despite groin pressure, the \nincompetent valves are in the thigh or calf, and \nPerthes’f test is performed.\n•\t Perthes’ test: repeat the Trendelenburg test, but \nwhen the patient stands, allow some blood to be \nreleased and then get him or her to stand up and \ndown on the toes a few times. The veins will \nbecome less tense if the perforating calf veins are \npatent and have competent valves (the muscle \npump is functioning).\nIf the pattern of affected veins is unusual (e.g. pubic \nvarices), try to exclude secondary varicose veins. These \nmay be due to an intrapelvic neoplasm that has \nobstructed deep venous return. Rectal and pelvic \nexaminations should then be performed.\nCHRONIC VENOUS DISEASE\nChronic venous stasis is a common cause of leg oedema. \nIt is a result of increased pressure in the venous system. \nThere may be a history of previous deep venous \nthrombosis or of varicose veins. These are associated \nwith incompetence of the valves of the perforating \ne\t Friedrich Trendelenburg (1844–1924), a professor of surgery in Leipzig.\nf\t\nGeorg Clemens Perthes (1869–1927), a German surgeon and professor \nof surgery at Tübingen.

This can lead to dilation of the upper part \nof the long saphenous veins and make their valves \nincompetent. Failure of the muscle pump mechanism \nthat directs blood up the veins can have similar effects. It \nis common in elderly inactive patients. Chronic venous \nstasis leads to oedema and a rise in tissue pressure, \nwhich causes thinning of skin and subcutaneous tissue. \nSkin ulceration and necrosis may occur.\nTypically ulcers occur above the medial malleoli. \nEventual healing often has inadequate circulation and \nskin will often break down again. The indurated skin \nis often stained a purple black colour; this is a result \nof staining with haemosiderin from red blood cells \nthat have been extravasated into the tissues. Chronic \nvenous eczema may complicate the condition. The legs \nappear more swollen and erythematous (Fig. 6.10). \nThis is often misdiagnosed as cellulitis (skin infection), \nbut cellulitis is never bilateral.\nThis chronic oedema is described as brawny. It will \npit only slowly and unwillingly on compression.

There is usually a \nresting tachycardia. Signs of shock—hypotension and \ncyanosis—indicate a very large and life-threatening \nembolus. There may be signs of deep vein thrombosis \n(DVT) in the legs, but absence of these by no means \nexcludes the diagnosis.\nAcute aortic dissection\nAcute aortic dissection is a difficult diagnosis that \ncannot usually be excluded on clinical grounds. A tear \nin the intima leads to blood surging into the aortic \nmedia separating the intima and adventitia; this may \npresent acutely or chronically. There are three different \ntypes: type I begins in the ascending aorta and extends \nproximally and distally, type II is limited to the ascending \naorta and aortic arch (this is particularly associated \nwith Marfan’s syndrome), and type III begins distal to \nthe left subclavian artery and has the best prognosis.\n•\t Symptoms:\n○\t Chest pain (typically very severe, it radiates to \nthe back and is maximal in intensity at the \ntime of onset due to either the aortic tear or \nassociated myocardial infarction).\n○\t Stroke.\n○\t Syncope (associated with tamponade); \nsymptoms of left ventricular failure.\n○\t Rarely, limb pain (ischaemia), paraplegia \n(spinal cord ischaemia) or abdominal pain \n(mesenteric ischaemia).\n•\t Signs: the examination can reveal signs that \nmake the diagnosis very likely (specific but not \nsensitive).\n○\t There may be signs of a body habitus \nassociated with dissection (e.g. Marfan’s or \nEhlers–Danlos syndrome).\n○\t A diminution of the radial pulse on one side \nor a difference in blood pressure of 20 mmHg \nor more between the arms is significant and \nsuggests dissection has progressed to involve \nthe origin of the arm vessels.\n○\t Examine the patient for signs of pericardial \ntamponade (p 123), which occurs if the aorta \nruptures into the pericardial sac. Examine the \nheart for signs of aortic regurgitation caused \nby disruption of the aortic valve annulus. A \nneurological examination may reveal signs of \nhemiplegia, due to dissection of one of the \ncarotid arteries. Rare signs that have been \ndescribed include a pulsatile sternoclavicular \njoint, hoarseness (recurrent laryngeal nerve \ncompression) and dysphagia (oesophageal \ncompression). A tracheal tug (p 179; Oliver’s \nsign) may be present if there is already an \naneurysm of the aortic arch.b The dilated \nvessel crosses the left main bronchus and pulls \nthe trachea down during systole.\nPERICARDIAL DISEASE\nAcute pericarditis\n•\t Signs: fever; dyspnoea; pericardial friction \nrub—sit the patient up and listen to the heart \nwith the patient holding his or her breath in \ndeep expiration (see the OCSE ECG 38 at \n).\n•\t Causes of acute pericarditis:\n1.\t Viral infection (coxsackie virus A or B, \ninfluenza).\n2.\t After myocardial infarction—early, or \nlate (10–14 days, termed Dressler’s \nsyndromec).\n3.\t After pericardiotomy (cardiac surgery).\n4.\t Chronic kidney disease.\n5.\t Neoplasia—tumour invasion (e.g. bronchus, \nbreast, lymphoma) or after irradiation for \ntumour.\n6.\t Connective tissue disease (e.g. systemic lupus \nerythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis).\n7.\t Hypothyroidism.\n8.\t Other infections (e.g. tuberculosis, pyogenic \npneumonia or septicaemia).\n9.\t Acute rheumatic fever.\n",

The examination aims to measure \nthe blood pressure level, determine whether there is \nan underlying cause present and assess the severity as \ndetermined by signs of end-organ damage. It is a common \nclinical problem.\nOn general inspection the signs of the rare causes of \nsecondary hypertension must be sought—for example, \nCushing’se syndrome, acromegaly, polycythaemia or \nchronic kidney disease.\nTake the blood pressure, with the patient lying and \nstanding, using an appropriately sized cuff. A rise in \ndiastolic pressure on standing occurs typically in essential \nhypertension; a fall on standing may suggest a secondary \ncause, but is usually an effect of antihypertensive \nmedications.\n•\t Palpate for radiofemoral delay, and check the \nblood pressure in the legs if coarctation of the \naorta is suspected or if severe hypertension is \ndiscovered before 30 years of age.\n•\t Next examine the fundi for retinal changes of \nhypertension (see Figs 7.4 and 7.5), which can be \nclassified from grades 1 to 4:\nGrade 1\n‘Silver wiring’ of the arteries only \n(sclerosis of the vessel wall reduces \nits transparency so that the central \nlight streak becomes broader and \nshinier).\nGrade 2\nGrade 1 plus arteriovenous nipping \nor nicking (indentation or deflection \nof the veins where they are crossed \nby the arteries).\nGrade 3\nGrade 2 plus haemorrhages (flame-\nshaped) and exudates (soft—\ncottonwool spots due to ischaemia; \nor hard—lipid residues from leaking \nvessels).\nGrade 4\nGrade 3 plus papilloedema.\nDescribe the changes present rather than just giving \na grade.\nFIGURE 7.4 \nNote the flame-shaped haemorrhages and \ncottonwool spots \n(Courtesy of Dr Chris Kennedy and Professor Ian Constable ©Lions \nEye Institute, Perth.)\nHypertensive retinopathy grade 3. \n",

A fourth \nheart sound is frequently detectable if the blood pressure \nis greater than 180 / 110 mmHg.\nThen go to the abdomen to palpate for renal or \nadrenal masses (possible causes) and for the presence \nof an abdominal aortic aneurysm (a possible \ncomplication). Auscultate for a renal bruit (p 261) due \nto renal artery stenosis.4 Remember that most left-sided \nabdominal bruits arise from the splenic artery and are \nof no significance. A bruit is less likely to be significant \nif it is short, soft and midsystolic. A loud systolic–\ndiastolic bruit that is prominent in the epigastrium is \nmore likely to be associated with renal artery stenosis.\nExamine the central nervous system for signs of \nprevious cerebrovascular accidents, and palpate and \nauscultate the carotid arteries for bruits (however, see \npp 105 and 537 for a discussion of the accuracy of this \nexamination). Stenosis may be a manifestation of \nvascular disease, and may be associated with renal \nartery stenosis. Urinalysis should also be performed \nto look for evidence of renal disease.\nCauses of systemic \nhypertension\nHypertension may be essential or idiopathic (more than \n95% of cases), or secondary (less than 5%). Immoderate \nalcohol and salt consumption and obesity (see Questions \nbox 4.5, p 70) are associated with hypertension. \nObstructive sleep apnoea is also an association.\nSecondary causes include:\n1.\trenal disease—renal artery stenosis, chronic \npyelonephritis, analgesic nephropathy, connective \ntissue disease, glomerulonephritis, polycystic \ndisease, diabetic nephropathy, reflux nephropathy\n2.\tendocrine disorders—Cushing’s syndrome, \nConn’s syndrome (primary aldosteronism), \nphaeochromocytoma, acromegaly, thyrotoxicosis, \nhypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism\n3.\tcoarctation of the aorta\n4.\tother, such as the contraceptive pill, \namphetamine, cocaine, polycythaemia rubra \nvera, toxaemia of pregnancy, neurogenic causes \n(increased intracranial pressure, lead poisoning, \nacute porphyria), hypercalcaemia.\nComplications of hypertension\nThese include left ventricular failure, cerebrovascular \nischaemic events (strokes), renal failure and eye \ndisease (blindness). Hypertension is also a risk factor \nfor ischaemic heart disease and peripheral vascular \ndisease, including abdominal aortic aneurysm \nand arterial dissections (see the OCSE ECG 43 at \n).\nMalignant (accelerated) \nhypertension\nThis can be defined as the presence of flame-shaped \nhaemorrhages, cottonwool spots and / or papilloedema \n(≥grade 3 retinal changes) as a result of severe \nhypertension.

Exertional dyspnoea and fatigue are then \ncommon, and chest pain possibly due to right ventricular \nischaemia occurs in up to 50% of patients. It is important \nto know what signs to look for in a patient who may \nhave pulmonary hypertension.\n•\t General signs (usually only in patients with \nsevere pulmonary hypertension): tachypnoea; \nperipheral cyanosis and cold extremities, due to \nlow cardiac output; hoarseness (very rare, due to \npulmonary artery compression of the left \nrecurrent laryngeal nerve).\n•\t Pulse: usually of small volume, due to the low \ncardiac output (only in severe disease).\n•\t JVP: prominent a wave, due to forceful right \natrial contraction.\n•\t Apex beat / praecordium: right ventricular heave; \npalpable P2.\n•\t Auscultation: systolic ejection click, due to \ndilation of the pulmonary artery; loud P2,f due to \nforceful valve closure because of high pulmonary \nartery pressures; S4; pulmonary ejection \nmurmur, due to dilation of the pulmonary artery \nresulting in turbulent blood flow; murmur of \npulmonary regurgitation if dilation of the \npulmonary artery occurs.\n•\t Signs of right ventricular failure (late: termed \ncor pulmonale).\nCauses of pulmonary \nhypertension\nPulmonary hypertension may be idiopathic (primary) \nor rarely hereditary or secondary. Secondary causes \ninclude:\n1.\tpulmonary emboli—e.g. blood clots, tumour \nparticles, fat globules\n2.\tlung disease—COPD (p 195), obstructive sleep \napnoea, interstitial lung disease (ILD)\n3.\tconnective tissue disease (with or without ILD), \ne.g. scleroderma\n4.\tleft ventricular failure resulting in back-pressure \ninto the pulmonary circulation or mitral stenosis\n5.\tcongenital heart disease causing a large left-to-\nright shunt—atrial septal defect, ventricular \nseptal defect, patent ductus arteriosus\n6.\tsevere kyphoscoliosis.\nINNOCENT MURMURS\nThe detection of a systolic murmur on routine \nexamination is a common problem. It can cause \nconsiderable alarm to both the patient and the \nexamining clinician. These murmurs in asymptomatic \npeople are often the result of normal turbulence within \nthe heart and great vessels. When no structural \nabnormality of the heart or great vessels is present \nthese are called innocent, functional or organic murmurs. \nThey probably arise from vibrations within the aortic \narch near the origins of the head and neck vessels or \nfrom the right ventricular outflow tract. They are more \ncommon in children and young adults. They are louder \njust after exercise and during febrile illnesses (a common \ntime for them to be detected).\nInnocent murmurs are always systolic. (A venous \nhum, which is not really a murmur, has both systolic \nand diastolic components.) They are usually soft and \nejection-systolic in character. Those arising from the \naortic arch may radiate to the carotids and be heard \nin the neck. Those arising from the right ventricular \noutflow tract are loudest in the pulmonary area and \nmay have a scratchy quality. These outflow tract \nmurmurs must be distinguished from the pulmonary \nflow murmur of an atrial septal defect. Therefore it is \nimportant to listen carefully for wide or fixed splitting \nof the second heart sound before pronouncing a \nmurmur innocent (see Questions box 7.1).\nVALVE DISEASES OF THE \nLEFT HEART\n(See Table 7.1.)\nMitral stenosis\nThe normal area of the mitral valve is 4 to 6 cm2. \nReduction of the valve area to half normal or less causes \nsignificant obstruction to left ventricular filling, and \n",

It is important to remember that \nthe signs of severity of aortic stenosis are less \nreliable in the elderly.6\n•\t Causes of aortic stenosis include:\n1.\t degenerative calcific aortic stenosis, \nparticularly in elderly patients\n2.\t calcific in younger patients, usually on a \ncongenital bicuspid valve\n3.\t rheumatic.\n•\t Other types of aortic outflow obstruction are \nalso possible:\n1.\t Supravalvular obstruction, where there is \nnarrowing of the ascending aorta or a fibrous \ndiaphragm just above the aortic valve—this is \nrare and may be associated with a \ncharacteristic facies (a broad forehead, widely \nset eyes and a pointed chin); there is a loud \nA2 and often a thrill in the area of the sternal \nnotch.\n2.\t Subvalvular obstruction, where there is a \nmembranous diaphragm or fibrous ridge just \nbelow the aortic valve—aortic regurgitation is \nassociated and is due to a jet lesion affecting \nthe coronary cusp of the valve.\n3.\t Dynamic left ventricular outflow tract \nobstruction may occur in hypertrophic \ncardiomyopathy—here there may be a double \napical impulse. Atrial contraction into a stiff \nleft ventricle may be palpable before the left \nventricular impulse (only in the presence of \nsinus rhythm, of course).\nAortic sclerosis presents in the elderly; there are none \nof the peripheral signs of aortic stenosis. The term \nimplies the absence of a gradient across the aortic valve \ndespite some thickening and a murmur.\nAortic regurgitation\nThe incompetent aortic valve allows regurgitation of \nblood from the aorta to the left ventricle during diastole \nfor as long as the aortic diastolic pressure exceeds the \nleft ventricular diastolic pressure.7,8\n•\t Symptoms: occur in the late stages of disease \nand include exertional dyspnoea, fatigue, \npalpitations (hyperdynamic circulation) and \nexertional angina.\n•\t General signs: Marfan’s syndrome, ankylosing \nspondylitis or one of the other seronegative \n",

Author \nof The principles and practice of medicine, he was very much opposed to \nthe naming of signs after people.\ni\t\nClaudius Galen (AD 130–200). Born in Pergamum, he worked as a gladiator’s \nsurgeon but moved to Rome in AD 164 to become the city’s most famous \nphysician. He was the first to describe the cranial nerves. He never \nperformed dissection on human bodies, but his often-erroneous anatomical \nteachings were regarded as infallible for 15 centuries.\nj\t\nThis is probably the most useful of all these eponymous signs; the diagnosis \nmay be strongly suspected from the end of the bed when it is present.\nh\t This Victorian children’s toy consisted of a sealed tube half-filled with \nfluid, with the other half being a vacuum. Inversion of the tube caused \nthe fluid to fall rapidly without air resistance and strike the other end \nwith a noise like a hammer blow. It is not easy to imagine a child today \nbeing entertained by this for very long.\narthropathies or, rarely, Argyll Robertson pupils \nmay be obvious.\n•\t Pulse and blood pressure: the pulse is \ncharacteristically collapsing, a ‘water hammer’h \npulse (see Table 7.2); there may be a wide pulse \npressure. This sign is most obvious if the clinician \nraises the patient’s arm while feeling the radial \npulse with the web spaces of the lifting hand. A \nbisferiens pulse (from the Latin, to beat twice) \nmay be a sign of severe aortic regurgitation or of \ncombined aortic regurgitation and aortic stenosis. \nIt is best assessed at the carotid artery, where two \nbeats can be felt in each cardiac cycle. It is \nprobably caused by a Venturi effect in the aorta \nrelated to rapid ejection of blood and brief \nin-drawing of the aortic wall, leading to a \ndiminution of the pulse followed by a rebound \nincrease. It was a particular favourite of Galen’s.i\n•\t Neck: prominent carotid pulsations (Corrigan’s \nsign).j\n•\t Palpation: the apex beat is characteristically \ndisplaced and hyperkinetic. A diastolic thrill may \nbe felt at the left sternal edge when the patient \nsits up and breathes out.\n•\t Auscultation (see Fig. 7.11): A2 (the aortic \ncomponent of the second heart sound) may be \nsoft; there is a decrescendo high-pitched diastolic \nmurmur beginning immediately after the second \nheart sound and extending for a variable time \ninto diastole—it is loudest at the third and fourth \nleft intercostal spaces; a systolic ejection murmur \nis usually present (due to associated aortic \nstenosis or to torrential flow across an aortic \nvalve of normal diameter).\nAortic stenosis is distinguished from an aortic \nflow murmur by the presence of the peripheral \nsigns of significant aortic stenosis, such as a \nplateau pulse. However, the harsher and louder \nthe murmur (and especially if there is a thrill), \nthe more likely it is to be aortic stenosis.\nAn Austin Flint murmurk may be present. \nThis is a low-pitched rumbling mid-diastolic and \npresystolic murmur audible at the apex (the \nregurgitant jet from the aortic valve causes the \nanterior mitral valve leaflet to shudder). It can \nbe distinguished from mitral stenosis because S1 \n(the first heart sound) is not loud and there is \nno opening snap. Many other signs have been \ndescribed, but they are interesting rather than \nhelpful (see Table 7.2 and Good signs guide 7.3).\n•\t Signs indicating severe chronic aortic \nregurgitation include:\n○\t collapsing pulse; wide pulse pressure (systolic \npressure 80 mmHg more than the diastolic)\n○\t long decrescendo diastolic murmur\n○\t left ventricular S3 (third heart sound)\n○\t soft A2\n○\t Austin Flint murmur\n○\t signs of left ventricular failure.\n•\t Causes of aortic regurgitation: disease may \naffect the valvular area or aortic root, and may be \nacute or chronic.\n",

It \nis more common in males. The underlying cause is \nuncertain but seems related to abnormal placement of \ntissue involved in the closing of the ductus arteriosus. \nThere is an association with bicuspid aortic valve and \nTurner’s syndrome.\n•\t Signs: the upper body may be better developed \nthan the lower; radiofemoral delay is present, \nand the femoral pulses are weak; hypertension \noccurs in the arms but not in the legs; a \nmidsystolic murmur is usually audible over the \npraecordium and the back, owing to blood flow \nthrough collateral chest vessels and across the \ncoarct itself.\nEbstein’s anomaly\nThis is a very rare lesion. The abnormality is a downward \ndisplacement of the tricuspid valve apparatus into the \nright ventricle so that the right atrium becomes very \nlarge and consists partly of ventricular muscle, while the \nright ventricle becomes small. An atrial septal defect is \ncommonly associated. Characteristically, multiple clicks \noccur owing to asynchronous closure of the tricuspid \nvalve. Tricuspid regurgitation is usually present.\nFIGURE 7.17 \nPatent ductus arteriosus: anatomy \nFIGURE 7.18 \nCoarctation of the aorta: anatomy \nPatent ductus arteriosus\n(See Fig. 7.17.)\nThis is a persistent embryonic vessel that connects \nthe pulmonary artery and the aorta. The shunt is from \nthe aorta to the pulmonary artery unless pulmonary \nhypertension has supervened.\n•\t Pulse and blood pressure: a collapsing pulse \nwith a sharp upstroke (due to ejection of a large \nvolume of blood into the empty aorta with \nsystole); low diastolic blood pressure (due to \nrapid decompression of the aorta).\n•\t Palpation: often there is a hyperkinetic apex \nbeat.\n•\t Auscultation: if the shunt is of moderate size a \nsingle second heart sound is heard, but if the \nshunt is of significant size then reversed splitting \nof the second heart sound occurs (due to a \ndelayed A2 because of an increased volume \nload in the left ventricle); a continuous loud \n‘machinery’ murmur maximal at the first \nleft intercostal space is usually present; flow \nmurmurs through the left side of the heart, \nincluding a mitral mid-diastolic murmur, may \nbe heard.\nNote: the transmitted sound from an arteriovenous \nfistula in the arm, used for dialysis, can cause a similar \ncontinuous murmur—to avoid embarrassment, look \nat the arm.\n",

If \nthere is wide fixed splitting, this suggests an atrial septal \ndefect. If a single second heart sound is present, this \nsuggests truncus arteriosus or a ventricular septal defect. \nA normal or reversed S2 suggests a patent ductus \narteriosus.\nFallot’s syndromes\nThere are four features that are due to a single \ndevelopmental abnormality (tetralogy of Fallot):\n1.\t ventricular septal defect\n2.\t right ventricular outflow obstruction, which \ndetermines the severity of the condition, and \ncan be at the pulmonary valve or infundibular \nlevel\n3.\t an aorta that overrides the ventricular \nseptal defect and is responsible for the \ncyanosis, and\n4.\t right ventricular hypertrophy secondary to \noutflow obstruction.\n•\t Signs: central cyanosis—this occurs without \npulmonary hypertension because venous mixing \nis possible at the ventricular level, where \npressures are balanced. The aorta overrides both \nventricles and so receives right and left \nventricular blood. Clubbing and polycythaemia \nare usually present. There may be evidence of \nright ventricular enlargement—a parasternal \nimpulse at the left sternal edge. A systolic thrill \ncaused by pulmonary valve or right ventricular \noutflow obstruction may be present. There is no \noverall cardiomegaly.

The causes of congenital heart \ndisease are listed in List 7.2. The important point \nto determine is whether or not signs of pulmonary \nhypertension are present. Congenital heart disease in \nwhich a shunt from the left to the right side of the \ncirculation occurs leads to an increase in pulmonary \nblood flow. This can cause reactive pulmonary \nhypertension so that pulmonary pressures eventually \nexceed systemic pressures. When that happens, the \nsystemic to pulmonary (left to right) shunt will reverse. \nThis right-to-left shunt leads to deoxygenated blood \nbeing mixed in the systemic circulation, resulting in \ncyanosis.

Blood returning from the lungs \ninto the left atrium is directed across into the right \natrium and into the morphological right ventricle and \non into the aorta. This means that the morphological \nright ventricle is working as the systemic ventricle. This \narrangement works very well, but there are long-term \nconcerns about the ability of the right ventricle to cope \nwith systemic workloads.\n•\t Symptoms: commonly include palpitations \ncaused by supraventricular arrhythmias, \ndizziness caused by bradycardias and \nbreathlessness related to failure of the systemic \nventricle. Occasionally, obstruction of the baffles \nmay occur. The most common problem is with \nthe superior vena caval baffle, which leads to \nfacial swelling and flushing.\n•\t Signs include: the usual scar, facial flushing and \noedema, cyanosis, peripheral oedema from \ninferior caval baffle obstruction and signs of \ntricuspid regurgitation.

Repair of the \nright ventricular outflow obstruction and enlargement \nof the pulmonary valve annulus may leave severe \npulmonary regurgitation. This may lead eventually to \nexertional dyspnoea. The surgery itself has, until \nrecently, required a right ventriculotomy (cutting into \nthe right ventricle). This leaves a scar that can be \nassociated with cardiac rhythm abnormalities in later \nlife. Patients may present with palpitations or syncope.\n•\t Signs may include:\n○\t a median sternotomy scar\n○\t a long diastolic murmur of pulmonary \nregurgitation\n○\t signs of right ventricular enlargement \n(parasternal impulse)\n○\t later signs of tricuspid regurgitation (big v \nwaves in the neck and a pulsatile liver).\nTransposition of the \ngreat arteries\nMost adults who have had surgery for this abnormality \nhave had a palliative operation called a Mustard \nprocedure. Younger adults are more likely to have had \na more definitive switch operation. In this abnormality, \nthe pulmonary artery is connected to the left ventricle \nand the aorta to the right ventricle. Thus the systemic \nand pulmonary circulations are in parallel. This is not \ncompatible with life unless some connection between \nthe two circulations is present. Neonates with the \ncondition will have had an atrial septal defect created \nsoon after birth with a catheter-based balloon (balloon \nseptostomy). This allows mixing of the circulations. \nLater, ‘baffles’ will be created surgically in the atria to \ndirect blood returning from the body into the right \nT&O’C ESSENTIALS\n1.\t Careful examination of the heart can lead to an \naccurate diagnosis in most cases of valvular \nheart disease.\n2.\t Proper history taking and examination will \nprevent the ordering of expensive and \ninappropriate cardiac tests.\n3.\t It is not necessary to memorise the entire list of \neponymous signs of aortic regurgitation (in \nfact, you can forget them all).\n4.\t The presence of specific signs of heart failure \n(e.g. a third heart sound and abnormal apex \nbeat) makes the diagnosis almost certain; their \nabsence does not rule out heart failure.\n5.\t There are few specific signs of myocardial \ninfarction and the diagnosis depends on the \nhistory and ECG.\n",

It is not \npossible to order even basic tests without knowing how \na test might be helpful and what it is able to detect. \nIn addition, students must have a basic understanding \nof electrocardiography and be able to diagnose \nimportant cardiac rhythm disturbances and recognise \nelectrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities suggesting \nmyocardial ischaemia or infarction.\nThe chest X-ray: a systematic \napproach\nInterpretation of the chest X-ray is not easy. It requires \nknowledge of anatomy and pathology, appreciation of \nthe whole range of normal appearances (see Fig. 8.2) \nand knowledge of the likely X-ray changes occurring \nwith pathological processes. The clinician should \nfeel personally responsible for viewing a patient’s \nradiographs.\nMost medical students faced with giving their \ninterpretation of a chest X-ray either opt for a ‘spot \ndiagnosis’ (usually wrong) or raise their eyes to heaven, \nhoping for divine inspiration. However, a systematic \napproach is generally more useful! More is missed by \nnot looking than by not knowing.\nAuscultation begins in the mitral area with both \nthe bell and the diaphragm. Listen for each \ncomponent of the cardiac cycle separately. \nIdentify the first and second heart sounds, and \ndecide whether they are of normal intensity and \nwhether the second heart sound is normally split. \nNow listen for extra heart sounds and murmurs. \nDo not be satisfied at having identified one \nabnormality.\nRepeat the approach at the left sternal edge \nand then the base of the heart (aortic and \npulmonary areas). Time each part of the cycle \nwith the carotid pulse. Listen over the carotids.\nIt is now time to reposition the patient. First put \nhim or her in the left lateral position. Again feel \nthe apex beat for character (particularly tapping) \nand auscultate. Sit the patient up and palpate \nfor thrills (with the patient in full expiration) at the \nleft sternal edge and base. Then listen in those \nareas, particularly for aortic regurgitation or a \npericardial rub.\nDynamic auscultation should be done if there \nis any doubt about a systolic murmur. The \nValsalva manoeuvre should be performed \nwhenever there is a pure systolic murmur. \nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy is easily missed \notherwise.\nThe patient is now sitting up. Percuss the back \nquickly to exclude a pleural effusion (e.g. due to \nleft ventricular failure) and auscultate for \ninspiratory crackles (left ventricular failure). If there \nis a radiofemoral delay, listen for a coarctation \nmurmur over the back. Feel for sacral oedema \nand note any back deformity (e.g. ankylosing \nspondylitis with aortic regurgitation).\nNext have the patient lie flat and examine the \nabdomen properly for hepatomegaly (right \nventricular failure) and a pulsatile liver (tricuspid \nregurgitation). Test for the abdominojugular reflux \nsign if relevant. Feel for splenomegaly \n(endocarditis) and an aortic aneurysm.\nMove on to the legs. Palpate both femoral \narteries and auscultate here for bruits. Go on and \nexamine all the peripheral pulses. Look for signs of \nperipheral vascular disease, peripheral oedema, \nclubbing of the toes, Achilles tendon xanthomata \nand stigmata of infective endocarditis.\nFinally, examine the fundi (for hypertensive \nchanges, and Roth’s spots in endocarditis) and \nthe urine (haematuria in endocarditis).

On full inspiration, the diaphragm lies at the \nlevel of the tenth or eleventh rib posteriorly or at the \nlevel of the sixth costal cartilage anteriorly. The right \nhemidiaphragm usually lies about 2 centimetres higher \nthan the left.\nCorrect orientation\nDo not miss dextrocardia—the heart apex will be to \nthe right and the stomach gas to the left. Do not be \nmisled by left or right markers wrongly placed by a \nradiographer.\nSystematic film interpretation\nMediastinum\nThe trachea should lie in the middle line. It may be \ndeviated by a goitre or mediastinal mass. It is normally \ndeviated a little to the left as it passes the aortic knuckle. \n(The aortic arch becomes wider and unfolded with age \nbecause of loss of elasticity.)\nThe mediastinum, including the trachea, can \nbe deviated by a large pleural effusion, a tension \npneumothorax or pulmonary collapse.\nRotation of the patient may make the mediastinum \nappear distorted.\nHila\nThe hila are mostly formed by the pulmonary arteries \nwith the upper lobe veins superimposed. The left hilum \nis higher than the right. The left has a squarish shape \nwhereas the right has a V shape.\nA hilum can become more prominent if the patient \nis rotated. Lymphadenopathy or a large pulmonary \nartery will cause hilar enlargement.\nHeart\nThe heart shape is ovoid with the apex pointing to the \nleft. Characteristically, about two-thirds of the heart \nprojects to the left of the spine.\nThe right heart border is formed by the outer border \nof the right atrium, and the left heart border by the \nleft ventricle. The left margin of the right ventricle lies \nabout a thumb’s breadth in from the left heart border. \n(On the surface of the heart, this is marked by the left \nanterior descending coronary artery.)\nThe cardiothoracic diameter is a rather approximate \nway of determining whether the heart is enlarged. If \nthe heart size is more than 50% of the transthoracic \ndiameter, enlargement may be present. Apparent slight \ncardiac enlargement can occur because of a relatively \nsmall AP diameter of the chest. A cardiothoracic ratio \nat the upper limit of normal should not cause alarm \nif the patient has no reason to have cardiac failure and \nno symptoms of it.\nValve calcification, if present, is better seen on the \nlateral view. On the frontal view, valve calcification \ncannot be visualised over the spine.\nDiaphragm\nThe hemidiaphragms visualised on the frontal films \nare the top of the domes seen tangentially. Much lung \nin the posterior costophrenic angles is not seen on the \nfrontal film.\nIf the hemidiaphragms are low and flat, emphysema \nmay be present. A critical look must be made beneath \nthe diaphragm to see whether there is free peritoneal \ngas.\nLung fields\nOn the frontal field, it is convenient to divide the lung \nfields into zones. It is easy then to compare one zone \nwith another for density differences and the distribution \nof the vascular ‘markings’.\nThe apices lie above the level of the clavicles. The \nupper zones include the apices and pass down to the \nlevel of the second costal cartilages. The mid zones \nlie between the second and fourth costal cartilage levels. \nThe lower zones lie between the fourth and sixth costal \ncartilages.\nThe radiolucency of the lung fields is due to the air \nfilling the lung. The ‘greyness’ is due to blood in the \npulmonary vessels.\nThe upper zones of the lungs are normally less well \nperfused, resulting in smaller blood vessels. When left \natrial pressure is elevated, there is upper zone blood \ndiversion and the vessels are congested.\nAn increase in lung radiolucency occurs when \nthe lungs are over-inflated (e.g. as a result of chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]). Lung \nradiolucency is reduced in the presence of an effusion \nor consolidation.\nTerms such as ‘opacity’, ‘consolidation’ and ‘patchy \nshadowing’ are used to describe the lung fields. It is \nusually unwise to attempt to make too precise a \ndiagnosis of the underlying pathology.\nThe lungs are divided into lobes by reflections of \nthe visceral pleura. The right lung is composed of the \nupper, middle and lower lobes. On the left, there are \nonly the upper and lower lobes.\n",

Flow rates of air in the trachea approach \nthe speed of sound during a forceful cough. Coughing \nenables the airways to be cleared of secretions and \nforeign bodies.\nThe duration of a cough is important (see Questions \nbox 9.1). Find out when the cough first became a \nproblem. A cough of recent origin, particularly if \nassociated with fever and other symptoms of respiratory \ntract infection, may be due to acute bronchitis or \npneumonia. A chronic cough (of more than 8 weeks \nduration) associated with wheezing may be due to \nasthma; sometimes asthma can present with just cough \nalone. A change in the character of a chronic cough \nmay indicate the development of a new and serious \nunderlying problem (e.g. infection or lung cancer).\nQUESTIONS TO ASK THE PATIENT  \nWITH A COUGH\n! denotes symptoms for the possible \ndiagnosis of an urgent or dangerous \nproblem.\n1.\t How long have you had the cough?\n2.\t Do you cough up anything?

Infections such as \ntuberculosis, Cryptococcus spp., Cytomegalovirus, \nVaricella and Aspergillosis spp. should be considered.\nSome patients feel the need to cough after an ectopic \nheartbeat. There may be an associated sensation of a \nmissed heartbeat.\nIt is an important (though perhaps a somewhat \nunpleasant task) to enquire about the type of sputum \nproduced and then to look at it, if it is available. Be \nwarned that some patients have more interest in their \nsputum than others and may go into more detail than \nyou really want. A large volume of purulent (yellow \nor green) sputum suggests the diagnosis of bronchiectasis \nor lobar pneumonia. Foul-smelling dark-coloured \nsputum may indicate the presence of a lung abscess \nwith anaerobic organisms. Pink frothy secretions from \nthe trachea, which occur in pulmonary oedema, should \nnot be confused with sputum. It is best to rely on the \npatient’s assessment of the taste of the sputum, which, \nnot unexpectedly, is foul in conditions like bronchiectasis \nor lung abscess.\nHaemoptysis\nHaemoptysis (coughing up of blood) can be a sinister \nsign of lung disease (see Table 9.2) and must always be \ninvestigated. It must be distinguished from haematemesis \n(vomiting of blood) and from nasopharyngeal bleeding \n(see Table 9.3).\nAsk how much blood has been produced. Mild \nhaemoptysis usually means less than 20 mL in 24 hours. \nIt appears as streaks of blood discolouring sputum. \nMassive haemoptysis is more than 250 mL of blood \nin 24 hours and represents a medical emergency; its \nmost common causes are carcinoma, cystic fibrosis, \nbronchiectasis and tuberculosis.\nBreathlessness (dyspnoea)\nThe awareness that an abnormal amount of effort is \nrequired for breathing is called dyspnoea. It can be \ndue to respiratory or cardiac disease, or lack of physical \nfitness or sometimes to anxiety (see List 9.3). Careful \nquestioning about the timing of onset, severity and \npattern of dyspnoea is helpful in making the diagnosis \n(see Questions box 9.2 and List 9.4).1 The patient may \nbe aware of this only on heavy exertion or have much \nmore limited exercise tolerance.

These include asthma or \nCOPD, infections such as bronchiolitis and airways \nobstruction by a foreign body or tumour. Wheeze is \nusually maximal during expiration and is accompanied \nby prolonged expiration. This must be differentiated \nfrom stridor (see below), which can have a similar \nsound, but is loudest over the trachea and occurs \nduring inspiration.\nChest pain\nChest pain due to respiratory disease is usually different \nfrom that associated with myocardial ischaemia (p 121). \nThe parietal pleura has pain fibres and may be the source \nof respiratory pain. Pleural pain is characteristically \npleuritic in nature: sharp and made worse by deep \ninspiration and coughing. It is typically localised to \none area of the chest. It may be of sudden onset in \npatients with:\n•\t lobar pneumonia\n•\t pulmonary embolism and infarction, or\n•\t pneumothorax\nand is often associated with dyspnoea.\nThe sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain and \ndyspnoea is an urgent diagnostic problem, as all three \nof these conditions may be life-threatening if not treated \npromptly.\nOTHER PRESENTING \nSYMPTOMS\nBacterial pneumonia is an acute illness in which \nprodromal symptoms (fever, malaise and myalgia) occur \nfor a short period (hours) before pleuritic pain and \ndyspnoea begin.\nViral pneumonia is often preceded by a longer (days) \nprodromal illness.

Severe sleep apnoea \nscores from 11 to 20.\napnoea (where there is cessation of inspiratory muscle \nactivity) may also present with somnolence but do not \nsnore excessively (see Table 9.4).\nSome patients respond to anxiety by increasing \nthe rate and depth of their breathing. This is called \nhyperventilation. The result is an increase in CO2 \nexcretion and the development of alkalosis—a rise in \nthe pH of the blood. These patients may complain of \nvariable dyspnoea; they have more difficulty breathing \nin than out. The alkalosis results in paraesthesias of the \nfingers and around the mouth, light-headedness, chest \npain and a feeling of impending collapse.\nCURRENT TREATMENT\nIt is important to find out what drugs the patient is \nusing (see List 9.8), how often they are taken and \nwhether they are inhaled or swallowed. The patient’s \nprevious and current medications may give a clue to \nthe current diagnosis. Bronchodilators and inhaled \nsteroids are prescribed for COPD and asthma. A \npatient’s increased use of bronchodilators suggests poor \ncontrol of asthma and the need for review of treatment.\nChronic respiratory disease, including sarcoidosis, \nhypersensitivity pneumonias and asthma, may have \nbeen treated with oral steroids.\nOral steroid use may predispose to tuberculosis or \npneumocystis pneumonia. Patients with chronic lung \nconditions like cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis will \noften be very knowledgeable about their treatment and \ncan describe the various forms of physiotherapy that \nare essential for keeping their airways clear.\nFind out whether home oxygen has been prescribed. \nAn oxygen concentrator or oxygen cylinder may be used \nand the oxygen administered by a mask or with nasal \nprongs. The flow rate is usually 2 L / minute or more \nand oxygen may be prescribed for 24 hours a day in \nsome cases. Portable oxygen cylinders and rechargeable \nportable concentrators are available. Home oxygen is \nexpensive and the rules for its prescription are quite \nstrict. Usually arterial blood gas measurements that \nshow low oxygen concentrations are required before \noxygen can be prescribed. For safety reasons patients \nmust have given up smoking before home oxygen can \nbe allowed.\nPulmonary rehabilitation courses are now commonly \nprescribed for patients with chronic lung disease. They \ninvolve graded exercise programs and information \npatients with tuberculosis may present with episodes \nof drenching sweating at night.\nHoarseness or dysphonia (an abnormality of the \nvoice) may sometimes be considered a respiratory \nsystem symptom. It can be due to transient inflammation \nof the vocal cords (laryngitis), vocal cord tumour or \nrecurrent laryngeal nerve palsy.\nSleep apnoea is an abnormal increase in the periodic \ncessation of breathing during sleep. Patients with \nobstructive sleep apnoea (OSA, where airflow stops \nduring sleep for periods of at least 10 seconds and \nsometimes for more than 2 minutes, despite persistent \nrespiratory efforts) typically present with:\n•\t daytime somnolence\n•\t chronic fatigue\n•\t morning headaches\n•\t personality disturbances.\nVery loud snoring may be reported by anyone within \nearshot.

The surface of the lungs is covered by the \nvisceral pleura, a thin membrane, and a similar outer \nlayer (the parietal pleura) lines the rib cage. These \nmembranes are separated by a thin layer of fluid and \nenable the lungs to move freely during breathing. \nVarious diseases of the lungs and of the pleura \nthemselves, including infection and malignancy, can \ncause accumulation of fluid within the pleural cavity \n(a pleural effusion) (Fig. 10.1).\nThe heart, trachea, oesophagus and the great blood \nvessels and nerves sit between the lungs and make \nup the structure called the mediastinum. The left and \nright pulmonary arteries supply their respective lung. \nGas exchange occurs in the pulmonary capillaries \nthat surround the alveoli, the tiny air sacs that lie \nbeyond the terminal bronchioles. Oxygenated blood \nis returned via the pulmonary veins to the left atrium. \nAbnormalities of the pulmonary circulation, such as \nraised pulmonary venous pressure resulting from heart \nfailure or pulmonary hypertension, can interfere with \ngas exchange.\nThe position of the heart, whose apex points to the \nleft, means that the left lung is smaller than the right \nand has only two lobes, which are separated by the oblique \nfissure. The right lung has both horizontal (upper) and \noblique (lower) fissures dividing it into three lobes (see \nFig. 10.2).\nThe muscles of respiration are the diaphragm, upon \nwhich the bases of the lungs rest, and the intercostal \nmuscles. During inspiration, the diaphragm flattens \nand the intercostal muscles contract to elevate the ribs. \nIntrathoracic pressure falls as air is forced under \natmospheric pressure into the lungs. Expiration is a \npassive process resulting from elastic recoil of the \nmuscles. Abnormalities of lung function or structure \nmay change the normal anatomy and physiology of \nrespiration, for example as a result of over-inflation of \nthe lungs (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \n[COPD]). Muscle and neurological diseases can also \naffect muscle function adversely, and abnormalities of \nthe control of breathing in the respiratory centres of \nthe brain in the pons and medulla can interfere with \nnormal breathing patterns.\nDuring the respiratory examination, keep in mind \nthe surface anatomy of the lungs and try to decide \nwhich lobes are affected.\nPOSITIONING THE PATIENT\nThe patient should be undressed to the waist.1 Women \nshould wear a gown or have a towel or some clothing \nto cover their breasts when the front of the chest is \nnot being examined. If the patient is not acutely ill, \nthe examination may be easiest to perform with him \nor her sitting over the edge of the bed or on a chair.\nGENERAL APPEARANCE\nIf the patient is an inpatient in hospital, look around \nthe bed for nasal prongs or a mask, metered dose \ninhalers (puffers) and other medications. Then make \na deliberate point of looking for the following signs \nbefore beginning the detailed examination.\nDyspnoea\nWatch the patient for signs of dyspnoea at rest. Count \nthe respiratory rate; the normal rate at rest should \nnot exceed 25 breaths per minute (range 16–25). The \nfrequently quoted normal value of 14 breaths per \n",

It is traditional to count the respiratory \nrate surreptitiously while affecting to count the pulse. \nThe respiratory rate is the only vital sign that is under \ndirect voluntary control. Tachypnoea refers to a rapid \nrespiratory rate of greater than 25. Bradypnoea is defined \nas a rate below 8, a level associated with sedation and \nadverse prognosis. In normal relaxed breathing, the \ndiaphragm is the only active muscle and is active only \nin inspiration; expiration is a passive process.\nCharacteristic signs of COPD\nLook to see whether the accessory muscles of respiration \nare being used. This is a sign of an increase in the work \nof breathing, and COPDa is an important cause. These \nmuscles include the sternocleidomastoids, the platysma \nand the strap muscles of the neck. Characteristically, \nthe accessory muscles cause elevation of the shoulders \nwith inspiration, and aid respiration by increasing chest \nexpansion.

Study of the sputum is an essential part of the \nphysical examination. The colour, volume and type \n(purulent, mucoid or mucopurulent), and the presence \nor absence of blood, should be recorded.\nStridor\nObstruction of the larynx or trachea (the extrathoracic \nairways) may cause stridor, a rasping or croaking noise \nloudest on inspiration. This can be due to a foreign \nbody, a tumour, infection (e.g. epiglottitis) or \ninflammation (see List 10.1). It is a sign that requires \nurgent attention.\nHoarseness\nListen to the patient’s voice for hoarseness (dysphonia), \nas this may indicate recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy \nassociated with carcinoma of the lung (usually \nleft-sided), or laryngeal carcinoma. However, the most \ncommon cause is laryngitis and the use of inhaled \ncorticosteroids for asthma. Non-respiratory causes \ninclude hypothyroidism.\nHANDS\nAs usual, examination in detail begins with the hands.\ntug (this is also a sign of severe asthma, especially in \nchildren—see Ch 37).b\nCyanosis\nCentral cyanosis is best detected by inspecting the \ntongue. Examination of the tongue differentiates central \nfrom peripheral cyanosis. Lung disease severe enough \nto result in significant ventilation–perfusion imbalance \n(such as pneumonia, COPD and pulmonary embolism) \nmay cause reduced arterial oxygen saturation and \ncentral cyanosis. Cyanosis becomes evident when the \nabsolute concentration of deoxygenated haemoglobin is \n50 g / L of capillary blood. Cyanosis is usually obvious \nwhen the arterial oxygen saturation falls below 90% \nin a person with a normal haemoglobin level. Central \ncyanosis is therefore a sign of severe hypoxaemia. In \npatients with anaemia, cyanosis does not occur until \neven greater levels of arterial desaturation are reached. \nThe absence of obvious cyanosis does not exclude \nhypoxia. The detection of cyanosis is much easier in \ngood (especially fluorescent) lighting conditions and \ndon’t be fooled if the patient’s bed is surrounded by \ncheerful pink curtains.\nCharacter of the cough\nCoughing is a protective response to irritation of sensory \nreceptors in the submucosa of the upper airways or \nbronchi. Ask the patient to cough several times. Lack \nof the usual explosive beginning may indicate vocal cord \nparalysis (the ‘bovine’ cough). A muffled, wheezy, \nineffective cough suggests obstructive pulmonary disease. \nA very loose productive cough suggests excessive \nbronchial secretions due to chronic bronchitis, \npneumonia or bronchiectasis. A dry, irritating cough \nmay occur with chest infection, asthma or carcinoma \nof the bronchus and sometimes with left ventricular \nfailure or interstitial lung disease (ILD). It is also typical \nof the cough produced by angiotensin-converting \nenzyme (ACE) inhibitor drugs. A barking or croupy \ncough may suggest a problem with the upper airway—\nthe pharynx and larynx, or pertussis infection.\nIMPORTANT CAUSES OF STRIDOR  \nIN ADULTS\nSudden onset (minutes)\nAnaphylaxis\nToxic gas inhalation\nAcute epiglottitis\nInhaled foreign body\nGradual onset (days, weeks)\nLaryngeal or pharyngeal tumours\nCricoarytenoid rheumatoid arthritis\nBilateral vocal cord palsy\nTracheal carcinoma\nParatracheal compression by lymph nodes\nPost-tracheostomy or intubation granulomata\nLIST 10.1 \nb\t When the trachea moves in time with the pulse, the sign suggests an \naneurysm of the thoracic aorta—this is the original meaning of tracheal \ntug.\n",

An uncommon but important association with \nclubbing is hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy \n(HPO). HPO is characterised by the presence of \nperiosteal inflammation at the distal ends of the long \nbones, the wrists, the ankles and the metacarpal and \nthe metatarsal bones. There is swelling and tenderness \nover the wrists and other involved areas. Rarely HPO \nmay occur without clubbing. The causes of HPO include \nprimary lung carcinoma and pleural fibromas.

A flapping \ntremor with a 2- to 3-second cycle may occur with \nsevere CO2 retention, which is usually due to severe \nCOPD.2 The problem is an inability to maintain a \nposture. Asterixisc can also be demonstrated by asking \nthe patient to protrude his or her tongue or lift the leg \nand keep the foot dorsiflexed. However, this is a late \nand unreliable sign and can also occur in patients with \nliver or renal failure.

An increase \nin the AP diameter compared with the lateral diameter \n(the thoracic ratio) beyond 0.9 is abnormal and is often \nseen in patients with severe asthma or emphysema. It \nis not always a reliable guide to the severity of the \nunderlying lung disease and may be present in normal \nelderly people. It is sometimes an illusion when the \nabdomen is relatively small in thin people.\nA funnel chest (pectus excavatum) is a \ndevelopmental defect involving a localised depression \nof the lower end of the sternum (see Fig. 10.6(a)). The \nproblem is usually an aesthetic one, but in severe cases \nlung capacity may be restricted.\nA pigeon chest (pectus carinatum) is a localised \nprominence (an outward bowing of the sternum and \ncostal cartilages; see Fig. 10.6(b)). It may be a \nmanifestation of chronic childhood respiratory illness, \nin which case it is thought to result from repeated \nstrong contractions of the diaphragm while the thorax \nis still pliable. It also occurs in rickets.f\nHarrison’sg sulcus is a linear depression of the lower \nribs just above the costal margins at the site of \nattachment of the diaphragm. It can result from severe \nasthma in childhood, or rickets.\nKyphosis refers to an exaggerated forward curvature \nof the spine, whereas scoliosis is lateral bowing. \nKyphoscoliosis can cause asymmetrical chest deformity; \nit may be idiopathic (80%), secondary to poliomyelitis \nor associated with Marfan’s syndrome. It is often seen \nin elderly patients or those on corticosteroids as a result \nof wedge fractures of thoracic vertebral bodies. Severe \nthoracic kyphoscoliosis may reduce the lung capacity \nand increase the work of breathing.\nLesions of the chest wall may be obvious. Look for \nscars from previous thoracic operations or from chest \ndrains for a previous pneumothorax or pleural effusion. \nSurgical removal of a lung (pneumonectomy) or of the \nlobe of a lung (lobectomy) leaves a long diagonal posterior \nscar on the thorax. The presence of three 2–3 centimetre \nscars suggests previous video-assisted thoracoscopic \nsurgery, which can be performed to biopsy lymph nodes \nor carry out lung reduction surgery or pleurodesis. \nThoracoplasty causes severe chest deformity; this \noperation was performed for tuberculosis and involved \nremoval of a large number of ribs on one side of the \nchest to achieve permanent collapse of the affected lung. \nf\t\nBone disease caused by vitamin D deficiency in childhood.\ng\t Edward Harrison (1766–1838), a British general practitioner in Lincolnshire, \ndescribed this deformity in rickets in 1798.

Practice is needed to appreciate the \ndifference between normal and abnormal. Vocal \nfremitus is more obvious in men because of their \nlower-pitched voices. It may be absent in normal people \n(high-pitched voice or thick chest wall). It is only \nabnormal if different on one side from the other. The \ncauses of change in vocal fremitus are the same as \nthose for vocal resonance (p 187).\nRibs\nGently compress the chest wall anteroposteriorly and \nlaterally. Localised pain suggests a rib fracture, which \nmay be secondary to trauma or may be spontaneous \nas a result of tumour deposition, bone disease or \nsometimes the result of severe and prolonged coughing. \nTenderness over the costochondral junctions suggests \nthe diagnosis of costochondritis as the cause of chest \npain.\nRegional lymph nodes\nThe axillary and cervical and supraclavicular nodes \nmust be examined (see Ch 21); they may be enlarged \nin lung malignancies and some infections.\nPercussion\nWith your left hand on the patient’s chest wall and \nfingers slightly separated and aligned with the patient’s \nribs, press your middle finger firmly against the patient’s \nchest. Use the pad of your right middle finger (the \nplexor) to strike firmly the middle phalanx of the middle \nfinger of your left hand (the pleximeter).j Remove the \npercussing finger quickly so that the note generated is \nnot dampened (this may be less important if the \npleximeter finger is held firmly on the chest wall, as it \nshould be). The percussing finger must be held partly \nflexed and a loose swinging movement should come \nfrom the wrist and not from the forearm. Medical \nstudents soon learn to keep the right middle fingernail \nshort.\nPercussion of symmetrical areas of the anterior, \nposterior and axillary regions is necessary (see Fig. \n10.10). Percussion in the supraclavicular fossa over the \napex of the lung and direct percussion of the clavicle \nwith the percussing finger are a traditional part of the \nexamination. For percussion posteriorly, the scapulae \nshould be moved out of the way by asking the patient \nto move the elbows forwards across the front of the \nchest; this rotates the scapulae anteriorly.\nThe feel of the percussion note is as important as \nits sound. The note is affected by the thickness of the \nchest wall, as well as by underlying structures. Percussion \nover a solid structure, such as the liver or a consolidated \nor collapsed area of lung, produces a dull note. Percussion \nover a fluid-filled area, such as a pleural effusion, \nproduces an extremely dull (stony dull) note. Percussion \nover the normal lung produces a resonant note and \npercussion over hollow structures, such as the bowel \nor a pneumothorax, produces a hyperresonant note.\nConsiderable practice is required before expert \npercussion can be performed, particularly in front of \nan audience. The ability to percuss well is usually \nobvious in clinical examinations and counts in a \nstudent’s favour, as it indicates a reasonable amount of \nexperience in the wards.\nLiver dullness\nThe upper level of liver dullness is determined by \npercussing down the anterior chest in the midclavicular \nline. Normally, the upper level of liver dullness is the \nsixth intercostal space in the right midclavicular line. \nIf the chest is resonant below this level, it is a sign of \nhyperinflation, usually due to emphysema or asthma. \nThis is a sign with considerable inter-observer variability.\nCardiac dullness\nThe area of cardiac dullness usually present on the left \nside of the chest may be decreased in emphysema or \nasthma.\nAuscultation\nBreath sounds\nUsing the diaphragm of the stethoscope, listen front \nand back (Fig. 10.11).7–9 Ask the patient to take big \nbreaths in and out through the mouth. It is important \nto compare each side with the other.

Although it is tempting to amuse oneself by waiting \npatiently for the patient to realise that expiration is also a part of breathing, \nthis tends to waste time.\nl\t\nFrom the Greek amphiphoreus meaning a ‘vase with a narrow neck’.\nthe heart, different parts of the cycle must be considered. \nListen for the quality of the breath sounds, the intensity \nof the breath sounds and the presence of additional \n(adventitious) sounds.\nQuality of breath sounds\nNormal breath sounds are heard with the stethoscope \nover nearly all parts of the chest. The patient should \nbe asked to breathe in and out through the mouth so \nthat added sounds from the nasopharynx do not \ninterfere.k During expiration these sounds are produced \nin the large airways rather than in the alveoli. However, \ninspiratory sounds are probably produced close to where \nthey are heard, in the peripheral parts of the lungs. \nSince both sounds were once thought to arise in the \nalveoli, or vesicles of the lungs, they are called vesicular \nsounds. They have rather fancifully been compared by \nLaënnec to the sound of wind rustling in leaves. Their \nintensity is related to total airflow at the mouth and \nto regional airflow. Normal (vesicular) breath sounds \nare louder and longer on inspiration than on expiration \nand there is no gap between the inspiratory and \nexpiratory sounds.\nBronchial breath sounds are present when turbulence \nin the large airways is heard without being filtered by \nthe alveoli. Bronchial breath sounds have a hollow, \nblowing quality. They are audible throughout expiration \nand there is often a gap between inspiration and \nexpiration. The expiratory sound has a higher intensity \nand pitch than the inspiratory sound. Bronchial breath \nsounds are more easily remembered than described. \nThey are audible in normal people, posteriorly over \nthe right upper chest where the trachea is contiguous \nwith the right upper bronchus. They are heard over \nareas of consolidation, as solid lung conducts the sound \nof turbulence in main airways to peripheral areas \nwithout filtering. Causes of bronchial breath sounds \nare shown in List 10.3.\nOccasionally, breath sounds over a large cavity have \nan exaggerated bronchial quality. This very hollow or \namphoricl sound has been likened to that heard when \nair passes over the top of a hollow jar.\nIntensity of the breath sounds\nIt is better to describe breath sounds as being of normal \nor reduced intensity than to speak about air entry. The \nentry of air into parts of the lung cannot be directly \ngauged from the breath sounds. Asymmetrical reduction \nof breath sounds is a sign of bronchial obstruction, for \nexample by carcinoma or a foreign body on the side \nwhere breath sounds are reduced. Causes of reduced \nbreath sounds include COPD (especially emphysema), \npleural effusion, pneumothorax, pneumonia, a large \nneoplasm and pulmonary collapse. Breath sounds are \ngenerally louder if a patient breathes more deeply, for \nexample after exercise.\nAdded (adventitious) sounds\nThere are two types of added sounds: continuous \n(wheezes) and interrupted (crackles).\nContinuous sounds are called wheezes. They are \nabnormal findings and have a musical quality. The \nwheezes must be timed in relation to the respiratory \ncycle. They may be heard in expiration or inspiration, \nor both. Wheezes are due to continuous oscillation of \nopposing airway walls and imply significant airway \nnarrowing. Wheezes tend to be louder on expiration. \nThis is because the airways normally dilate during \ninspiration and are narrower during expiration. An \ninspiratory wheeze implies severe airway narrowing.\nThe pitch (frequency) of wheezes varies. It is \ndetermined only by the velocity of the air jet and is \nnot related to the length of the airway. High-pitched \nwheezes are produced in the smaller bronchi and have \na whistling quality, whereas low-pitched wheezes \n(sometimes called rhonchi) arise from the larger \nbronchi.\n",

      "text": "\t\nCHAPTER 10  The respiratory examination\t\n187\nm\t Expiratory crackles may also occur with lung fibrosis.\nn\t From the Greek aix meaning ‘goat’ and phone meaning ‘voice’.\nWheezes are usually the result of acute or chronic \nairflow obstruction due to asthma (often high-pitched) \nor COPD (often low-pitched), secondary to a \ncombination of bronchial muscle spasm, mucosal \noedema and excessive secretions. Wheezes are a poor \nguide to the severity of airflow obstruction. In severe \nairway obstruction, wheeze can be absent because \nventilation is so reduced that the velocity of the air jet \nis reduced below a critical level necessary to produce \nthe sound.\nA fixed bronchial obstruction, usually due to a \ncarcinoma of the lung, tends to cause a localised wheeze, \nwhich has a single musical note (monophonic) and \ndoes not clear with coughing.\nWheezes must be distinguished from stridor (p 177), \nwhich sounds very similar to wheeze but is louder over \nthe trachea and is always inspiratory (wheezes usually \noccur in expiration—but can occur in both inspiration \nand expiration).\nInterrupted non-musical sounds are best called \ncrackles.10,11 There is a lot of confusion about the naming \nof these sounds, perhaps as a result of mistranslations \nof Laënnec. Some authors describe low-pitched crackles \nas râles and high-pitched ones as crepitations, but others \ndo not make this distinction. The simplest approach \nis to call all these sounds crackles, but also to describe \ntheir timing and pitch. Crackles are sometimes present \nin normal people but these crackles will always clear \nwith coughing.\nCrackles are probably the result of loss of stability \nof peripheral airways that collapse on expiration. With \nhigh inspiratory pressures, there is rapid air entry into \nthe distal airways. This causes the abrupt opening \nof alveoli and of small- or medium-sized bronchi \ncontaining secretions in regions of the lung deflated \nto residual volume. More compliant (distensible) \nareas open up first, followed by the increasingly stiff \nareas. Fine- and medium-pitched crackles are not \ncaused by air moving through secretions as was once \nthought, but rather by the opening and closing of small \nairways.\nThe timing of crackles is of great importance. Early \ninspiratory crackles (which cease before the middle of \ninspiration) suggest disease of the small airways and \nare characteristic of COPD.10 The crackles are heard \nonly in early inspiration and are of medium coarseness. \nThey are different from those heard in left ventricular \nfailure, which occur later in the respiratory cycle.\nLate or pan-inspiratory crackles suggest disease \nconfined to the alveoli. They may be fine, medium or \ncoarse in quality. Fine crackles have been likened to \nthe sound of hair rubbed between the fingers, or to \nthe sound Velcro makes when pulled apart. They \nare typically caused by ILD (pulmonary fibrosis). \nCharacteristically, more crackles are heard in each \ninspiration when they are due to fibrosis—up to 14 \ncompared with 1 to 4 for COPD and 4 to 9 for cardiac \nfailure. As ILD becomes more severe the crackles extend \nearlier into inspiration and are heard further up the \nchest.m Medium crackles are usually due to left \nventricular failure. Here the presence of alveolar fluid \ndisrupts the function of the normally secreted surfactant. \nCoarse crackles are characteristic of pools of retained \nsecretions and have an unpleasant gurgling quality. \nThey tend to change with coughing, which also has an \nunpleasant gurgling quality. Bronchiectasis is a common \ncause, but any disease that leads to retention of \nsecretions may produce these features.\nPleural friction rub: when thickened, roughened \npleural surfaces rub together as the lungs expand and \ncontract, a continuous or intermittent grating sound \nmay be audible. A pleural rub indicates pleurisy, which \nmay be secondary to pulmonary infarction or \npneumonia. Rarely, malignant involvement of the \npleura, a spontaneous pneumothorax or pleurodynia \nmay cause a rub.\nVocal resonance\nAuscultation over the chest while a patient speaks gives \nfurther information about the lungs’ ability to transmit \nsounds. Over normal lung, the low-pitched components \nof speech are heard with a booming quality and \nhigh-pitched components are attenuated. Consolidated \nlung, however, tends to transmit high frequencies so \nthat speech heard through the stethoscope takes on a \nbleating quality (called aegophonyn by Laënnec12). When \na patient with aegophony says ‘e’ as in ‘bee’ it sounds \nlike ‘a’ as in ‘bay’.\nIncreased vocal resonance is a helpful sign in \nconfirming consolidation but may not be necessary as \na routine.

Note especially signs \nof respiratory distress and cyanosis.\n3.\t Ask the patient to cough and look at the \ncontents of the sputum mug.\n4.\t Remember that lung disease may be associated \nwith peripheral signs such as clubbing and \nHorner’s syndrome.\n5.\t Upper lobe signs can be difficult to elicit but \nlook especially for tracheal deviation and \ncompare movement of the clavicles from above \nand behind.\n6.\t The fine late inspiratory crackles of interstitial \nlung disease are very characteristic and once \nheard are easily remembered.\no\t From the Greek word for falling, this was once mostly applied to the \neyelid but now seems accepted as a description of the displacement of \nany organ.\np\t Hugh Pemberton (1891–1956), a physician in Liverpool, UK.\nlung the numbers will become clearly audible, while \nover normal lung the sound is muffled. If vocal \nresonance is present, bronchial breathing is likely to \nbe heard (see List 10.3). Sometimes vocal resonance \nis increased to such an extent that whispered speech \nis distinctly heard; this is called whispering pectoriloquy.\nIf a localised abnormality is found at auscultation, \ntry to determine the lobe involved (see Fig. 10.2).\nTHE HEART\nCardiac examination is an essential part of the \nrespiratory assessment and vice versa. These two systems \nare intimately related.\nLay the patient down at 45° and measure the jugular \nvenous pressure (JVP) for evidence of right heart failure. \nNext examine the praecordium. It is important to pay \nclose attention to the pulmonary component of the \nsecond heart sound (P2). This is best heard at the second \nintercostal space on the left. It should not be louder than \nthe aortic component, best heard at the right second \nintercostal space. If the P2 is louder (and especially if it \nis palpable), pulmonary hypertension should be strongly \nsuspected. There may be signs of right ventricular failure \nor hypertension. Pulmonary hypertensive heart disease \n(cor pulmonale) may be primary or due to COPD, ILD, \npulmonary thromboembolism, marked obesity, sleep \napnoea or severe kyphoscoliosis.\nTHE ABDOMEN\nPalpate the liver for ptosis,o due to emphysema, or for \nenlargement from secondary deposits of tumour in \ncases of lung carcinoma (see Ch 14).\nOTHER\nPemberton’sp sign\nAsk the patient to lift the arms over the head and wait \nfor 1 minute.13 Note the development of facial plethora, \ncyanosis, inspiratory stridor and non-pulsatile elevation \nof the JVP. This occurs in superior vena caval \nobstruction.\nLegs\nInspect the patient’s legs for swelling (oedema) or \ncyanosis, which may be clues to cor pulmonale, and \nlook for evidence of deep venous thrombosis.\nRespiratory rate on exercise\nPatients complaining of dyspnoea should have their \nrespiratory rate measured at rest, at maximal tolerated \nexertion (e.g. after climbing one or two flights of stairs \nor during a treadmill exercise test) and supine. If \ndyspnoea is not accompanied by tachypnoea when the \npatient climbs the stairs, consider the possibility of \nanxiety or malingering.\nTemperature\nFever may occur with any acute or chronic chest \ninfection.\n",

It may be necessary to \ndemonstrate this to the patient. The normal forced \nexpiratory time is 3 seconds or less. Note any audible \nwheeze or cough. An increased FET indicates airways \nobstruction. The combination of a significant smoking \nhistory and an FET of 9 seconds or more is predictive \nof chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (LR+ \n9.6).2 A peak flow meter or spirometer, however, will \nprovide a more accurate measurement of lung function.\nPeak flow meter\nA peak flow meter is a simple gauge that is used to \nmeasure the maximum flow rate of expired air (Fig. \n12.2). Again the patient is asked to take a full breath in \nbut, rather than a prolonged expiration, a rapid forced \nmaximal expiratory puff is made through the mouth.c \nThe value obtained (the peak expiratory flow [PEF]) \ndepends largely on airways diameter. Normal values \nare approximately 600 litres per minute for young men \nand 400 litres per minute for young women. The value \ndepends on age, sex and height, so tables of normal \nvalues should be consulted. Airways obstruction, \nsuch as that caused by asthma or COPD, results \nin a reduced and variable PEF. It is a simple way \nof assessing and following patients with airways \nobstruction, but is rather effort dependent. The PEF \nis most useful when used for serial estimates of lung \nfunction.\n",

It is usual to record the best \nof three attempts and to calculate the FEV1 / FVC ratio \nas a percentage. In healthy youth, the normal value is \n80%, but this may decline to as little as 60% in old age. \nNormal values also vary with sex, age, height and race.\nReversibility of a reduced FEV1 / FVC after the use \nof bronchodilators is an important test for distinguishing \nasthma from COPD.\nObstructive ventilatory defect\nWhen the FEV1 / FVC ratio is reduced (<70%) this is \nreferred to as an obstructive defect. Both values tend \nto be reduced, but the FEV1 is disproportionately low. \nThe causes are loss of elastic recoil or airways narrowing, \nas in asthma or COPD.\nRestrictive ventilatory defect\nWhen the FEV1 / FVC ratio is normal or higher than \nnormal, but both values are reduced, the pattern is \ndescribed as a restrictive defect. This occurs in \nparenchymal lung disease, such as interstitial lung \ndisease (ILD), sarcoidosis or when lung expansion is \nreduced by pneumonia or chest wall abnormalities.\nFlow volume curve\nAs a part of spirometric assessment, the flow volume \ncurve may be measured using a portable electronic \ndevice.

SIR WILLIAM OSLER (1849–1919)\nGastroenterologists and gastrointestinal surgeons \nconcern themselves with the entire length of the gut, \nthe exocrine pancreas, the liver and the peripheral \neffects of alimentary disease.\nPRESENTING SYMPTOMS\n(See List 13.1.)\nFrequency and duration\nIs the pain acute or chronic, when did it begin and \nhow often does it occur?\nSite and radiation\nThe site of the pain is important. Ask the patient to \npoint to the area affected by pain and to the point of \nmaximum intensity. Parietal peritoneal inflammation \nthat causes pain usually does so in a localised area. \nAsk about radiation of pain.\n•\t Pain that radiates through to the back suggests \npancreatic disease or a penetrating peptic \nulcer.\n•\t Pain due to diaphragmatic irritation may radiate \nto the shoulder.\n•\t Pain due to oesophageal reflux or spasm may \nradiate to the throat.\nCharacter and pattern\nThe pain may be colicky (coming and going in waves \nand related to peristaltic movements) or steady. Colicky \npain comes from obstruction of the bowel or the \nureters. Colicky pain arises because of complete or \npartial blockage of the bowel, which triggers intestinal \npain receptors. If the pain is chronic, ask about its \ndaily pattern.\nAggravating and relieving factors\n•\t Pain due to peptic ulceration may occur after \nmeals (when acid increases).\n•\t Eating may precipitate ischaemic pain in the \ngut (a result of a reduction of blood supply \nto the bowel caused by arterial disease or \nembolism).\nGASTROINTESTINAL HISTORY\nMajor symptoms\nAbdominal pain\nAppetite and / or weight change\nPostprandial fullness or early satiation, or both\nNausea and / or vomiting\nHeartburn and / or acid regurgitation\nWaterbrash\nDysphagia\nDisturbed defecation (diarrhoea, constipation, \nfaecal incontinence)\nBloating or visible distension, or both\nBleeding (haematemesis, melaena, rectal \nbleeding)\nJaundice\nDark urine, pale stools\nPruritus\nLethargy\nFever\nLIST 13.1 \nAbdominal pain\nThere are many causes of abdominal pain, and careful \nhistory taking will often lead to the correct diagnosis. \nThe following should be considered.\n",

      "text": "218\t\nSECTION 4  The gastrointestinal system\n\t\n•\t Vomiting or the use of antacids may relieve \npeptic ulcer pain or that of gastro-oesophageal \nreflux.\n•\t Defecation or passage of flatus may temporarily \nrelieve the pain of colonic disease.\n•\t Patients who obtain some relief by rolling around \nvigorously are more likely to have a colicky pain \n(e.g. from bowel obstruction), while those who \nlie perfectly still are more likely to have \nperitonitis.\nPatterns of pain\nPeptic ulcer disease\nThis is classically a dull or burning pain in the \nepigastrium that is relieved to a degree by food or \nantacids. It is typically episodic and may occur at night, \nwaking the patient from sleep. This combination of \nsymptoms is suggestive of the diagnosis. The pain is \nnot always related to meals, despite classical teaching \nto the contrary. It is not possible to distinguish duodenal \nulceration from gastric ulceration clinically. Many \npatients with epigastric pain related to meals have no \nevidence of peptic ulcer on investigation (referred to \nas non-ulcer or functional dyspepsia).\nPancreatic pain\nThis is a steady epigastric pain that may be partly \nrelieved by sitting up and leaning forwards. There is \noften radiation of the pain to the back, and vomiting \nis common.\nBiliary pain\nAlthough usually called ‘biliary colic’, this pain is rarely \ncolicky. Obstruction of the cystic duct often causes \nepigastric pain. It is usually a severe, constant pain that \ncan last for hours. There may be a history of episodes \nof similar pain in the past; although pain episodes can \noccur after fatty meals, they are usually unpredictable. \nIf cholecystitis develops, the pain typically shifts to the \nright upper quadrant and becomes more severe. Biliary \ncolic is often associated with nausea and vomiting.\nRenal colic\nThis is a colicky pain superimposed on a background \nof constant pain in the renal angle, often with radiation \ntowards the groin. It can be very severe indeed.\na\t The word nauseous can mean either nauseated (i.e. feeling like vomiting) \nor repulsive (i.e. likely to make other people vomit). It is probably best to \nuse the word nauseated to describe a patient who feels like vomiting in \norder to avoid this unfortunate ambiguity. (The Latin word has only the \nsecond meaning.)\nBowel obstruction\nThis is colicky pain. Periumbilical pain suggests a \nsmall-bowel origin but colonic pain can occur anywhere \nin the abdomen. Small-bowel obstruction tends to cause \nmore frequent colicky pain (with a cycle every 2–3 \nminutes) than does large-bowel obstruction (every \n10–15 minutes). Obstruction is often associated with \nvomiting, constipation and abdominal distension.\nAppetite and weight change\nLoss of appetite (anorexia) and weight loss are important \ngastrointestinal symptoms. The presence of both \nanorexia and weight loss should make one suspicious \nof an underlying malignancy, but they may also occur \nwith depression and in other diseases. The combination \nof weight loss with an increased appetite suggests \nmalabsorption of nutrients or a hypermetabolic state \n(e.g. thyrotoxicosis). It is important to document when \nthe symptoms began and how much weight loss has \noccurred over this period. Liver disease can sometimes \ncause disturbance of taste. This may cause smokers \nwith acute hepatitis and jaundice to give up smoking.\nEarly satiation and \npostprandial fullness\nInability to finish a normal meal (early satiation) may be \na symptom of gastric diseases, including gastric cancer \nand peptic ulcer. A feeling of inappropriate fullness after \neating can also be a symptom of functional dyspepsia.\nNausea and vomiting\nNausea is the sensation of wanting to vomit.a Heaving \nand retching may occur but there is no expulsion of \ngastric contents. Vomiting refers to the explosive \nejection of stomach contents through the mouth; it \nis involuntary.\nThere are many possible causes:\n•\t gastrointestinal tract infections (e.g. from food \npoisoning by Staphylococcus aureus) or\n•\t small-bowel obstruction\ncan cause acute symptoms.\n",

Also ask about the contents of the vomitus \n(e.g. bile indicates an open connection between the \nduodenum and stomach, old food suggests gastric outlet \nobstruction, while blood suggests ulceration). Vomiting \ndue to bowel obstruction may occur with little or no \nnausea.\nVomiting is different from rumination. Rumination \nis effortless regurgitation of food into the mouth after \neating; patients often call this vomiting when asked to \ndescribe what they mean.

Swallowing \ninvolves two phases:\n1.\tThe oropharyngeal component—food passes \nfrom mouth to hypopharynx and on to upper \noesophagus.\n2.\tThe oesophageal component—the food bolus \npasses through the oesophagus to the stomach.\nSuch difficulty may occur with solids or liquids. The \ncauses of dysphagia are listed in List 13.2. If a patient \ncomplains of difficulty swallowing, it is important to \ndifferentiate painful swallowing from actual difficulty.1 \nPainful swallowing is termed odynophagia and occurs \nwith any severe inflammatory process involving the \noesophagus. Causes include infectious oesophagitis \n(e.g. Candida, herpes simplex), peptic ulceration of \nthe oesophagus, caustic damage to the oesophagus or, \nrarely, oesophageal perforation.\nIf the patient complains of difficulty initiating \nswallowing (see Questions box 13.3), fluid regurgitating \ninto the nose or choking on trying to swallow, this \nsuggests that the cause of the dysphagia is in the pharynx \n(oropharyngeal dysphagia). Causes of oropharyngeal \ndysphagia can include neurological disease (e.g. motor \nneurone disease, resulting in bulbar or pseudobulbar \npalsy).\nIf the patient complains of food sticking in the \noesophagus, it is important to consider a number of \nanatomical causes of oesophageal blockage.1 Ask the \npatient to point to the site where the solids stick.

Patients may complain of frequent \nstools (more than three per day or a change from \nprevious frequency is abnormal) or they may complain \nof a change in the consistency of the stools, which have \nbecome loose or watery. There are a large number of \npossible causes of diarrhoea.\nAsk about the frequency and volume.

Steatorrhoea is \ndefined as the presence of more than 7 g of fat \nin a 24-hour stool collection. There are many \ncauses of steatorrhoea (p 280).\nConstipation\nIt is important to determine what patients mean if they \nsay they are constipated.3 Constipation is a common \nsymptom and can refer to the infrequent passage of \nstools (fewer than three times per week), hard stools \nor stools that are difficult to evacuate.\nThis symptom may occur acutely or may be a \nchronic problem (see Questions box 13.5). In many \npatients, chronic constipation arises because of habitual \nneglect of the impulse to defecate, leading to the \naccumulation of large, dry faecal masses. With constant \nrectal distension from faeces, the patient may grow \nless aware of rectal fullness, and this leads to chronic \nconstipation.\nc\t Harold Hirschsprung (1830–1916), a physician at Queen Louise Hospital \nfor Children, Copenhagen, described this disease in 1888. It had previously \nbeen described by Caleb Parry, English physician, in 1825.\nb\t Robert Milton Zollinger (1903–92), an American surgeon, and Edwin H \nEllison (1918–70), an American physician. This syndrome is characterised \nby gastric acid hypersecretion, peptic ulceration and in 40% of cases \ndiarrhoea, due to a gastrinoma (gastrin-secreting tumour). It was described \nin 1955.\nQUESTIONS TO ASK A PATIENT \nPRESENTING WITH CONSTIPATION\n! denotes symptoms for the possible \ndiagnosis of an urgent or dangerous \nproblem.\n1.\t How often do you have a bowel \nmovement?\n2.\t Are your stools hard or difficult to pass?\n3.\t What do the stools look like (stool form, \ne.g. small pellets)?\n4.\t Do you strain excessively on passing \nstool?\n5.\t Do you feel there may be a blockage at \nthe anus area when you try to pass stool?\n6.\t Do you ever press your finger in around \nthe anus (or vagina) to help stool pass?\n!\t  7.\t Has your bowel habit changed recently?\n8.\t Any recent change in your medication?\n!\t  9.\t Any blood in the stools?\n10.\t Any abdominal pain?

Sometimes patients may present because \nroutine testing for occult blood in the stools is positive \n(p 268). It is important to try to find out, if vomiting of \nblood is reported, that this is not the result of bleeding \nfrom a tooth socket or the nose, or the coughing up \nof blood.\nHaematemesis indicates that the site of the bleeding \nis proximal to, or within, the duodenum (see Table \n13.1). Ask about symptoms of peptic ulceration; \nhaematemesis is commonly due to bleeding chronic \npeptic ulceration, particularly from a duodenal ulcer. \nPeptic ulcers often bleed without causing abdominal \npain.\nAsk whether the blood came up with the first vomit \nor not (see Questions box 13.6). A Mallory–Weiss tear \nusually occurs with repeated vomiting; typically the \npatient reports first the vomiting of clear gastric contents \nand then the vomiting of blood.\nAsk if there is blood in the stool, and whether it is \non top or mixed in. Haemorrhoids and local anorectal \ndiseases such as fissures will commonly present with \npassing small amounts of bright-red blood per rectum. \nThe blood is normally not mixed in the stools but is \non the toilet paper, on top of the stools or in the toilet \nbowl.\nMelaena (black tarry stools) usually results from \nbleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract, although \nright-sided colonic and small-bowel lesions can \noccasionally be responsible. Massive bright-red rectal \nbleeding can occur from the distal colon or rectum, or \nimportant to determine whether there has been a recent \nchange in bowel habit, as this may indicate development \nof a malignancy. Patients with very severe constipation \nin the absence of structural disease may be found \non a transit study to have slow colonic transit; such \nslow-transit constipation is most common in young \nwomen.\nConstipation is common throughout pregnancy but \nespecially in the later stages.\nAsk about excessive straining or a feeling of stool \nbeing blocked during attempted bowel movements. \nDifficulty with evacuation of faeces may occur with \ndisorders of the pelvic floor muscles or nerves, or \nanorectal disease (e.g. fissure or stricture). Patients with \nthis problem may complain of straining, a feeling of \nanal blockage or even the need to self-digitate to \nperform manual evacuation of faeces.\nPatients confined to bed in hospital or who have \nhad abdominal operations are often constipated. \nStarvation and changes in diet can be other causes.\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\nA chronic but erratic disturbance in defecation (typically \nalternating constipation and diarrhoea) associated with \nabdominal pain, in the absence of any structural or \nbiochemical abnormality, is very common; such patients \nare classified as having the irritable bowel syndrome.4,5 \nPatients who report abdominal pain plus two or more \nof the following symptoms—abdominal pain relieved \nby defecation, looser or more frequent stools with the \nonset of abdominal pain, passage of mucus per rectum, \na feeling of incomplete emptying of the rectum following \ndefecation and visible abdominal distension—are more \nlikely to have the irritable bowel syndrome than organic \ndisease.

Toxin exposure \ncan also be important in chronic liver disease (e.g. \ncarbon tetrachloride, vinyl chloride). If a patient has \nsymptoms suggestive of liver disease, ask about recent \ntravel to countries where hepatitis is endemic.\nThe alcohol history is very important, particularly \nas alcoholics often deny or understate the amount they \nconsume (see List 1.3, p 18). Contact with anybody \nwho has been jaundiced should always be noted.\nThe sexual history should be obtained. A history \nof any injections (e.g. intravenous drugs, plasma \ntransfusions, dental treatment or tattooing) in a patient \nwho presents with symptoms of liver disease is \nimportant, particularly as hepatitis B or C may be \ntransferred in this way. Risk factors for viral hepatitis \ninclude sexual activity (e.g. between men), intravenous \ndrug use, blood transfusion and tattoos.\nFAMILY HISTORY\nA family history of colon cancer, especially of familial \npolyps, or inflammatory bowel disease is important. \nAsk about coeliac disease in the family. A positive \nfamily history of jaundice, anaemia, splenectomy \nor cholecystectomy may occur in patients with \nhaemolytic anaemia (due to haemoglobin abnormalities \nor autoimmune disease) or congenital or familial \nhyperbilirubinaemia.\n•\t Acute hepatitis can occur with halothane, \nphenytoin or chlorothiazide.\n•\t Cholestasis may occur from a hypersensitivity \nreaction to chlorpromazine or other \nphenothiazines, sulfonamides, sulfonylureas, \nphenylbutazone, rifampicin or nitrofurantoin.\n•\t Anabolic steroids and the contraceptive pill can \ncause dose-related cholestasis.\n•\t Fatty liver can occur with alcohol use, \ntetracycline, valproic acid or amiodarone.\n•\t Large blood-filled cavities in the liver called \npeliosis hepatis can occur with anabolic steroid \nuse or the contraceptive pill.\n•\t Acute liver cell necrosis can occur if an overdose \nof paracetamol (acetaminophen) is taken.\nPAST HISTORY\nSurgical procedures can result in jaundice from the \nanaesthesia (e.g. multiple uses of halothane), hypoxaemia \nof liver cells (hypotension during the operative or \npostoperative period) or direct damage to the bile duct \nduring abdominal surgery. A history of relapsing and \nremitting epigastric pain in a patient who presents with \nsevere abdominal pain may indicate that a peptic ulcer \nhas perforated. A past history of inflammatory bowel \ndisease (either ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease) is \nimportant as these are chronic diseases that tend to \nflare up.\nT&O’C ESSENTIALS\n1.\t Eliciting individual gastrointestinal symptoms \nand the pattern of presentation will often lead to \nthe correct diagnosis.\n2.\t Ask what the patient means if he or she uses \nterms like vomiting (could it really be \nrumination?), constipation or diarrhoea.\n3.\t Intermittent dysphagia and food impaction \nsuggests eosinophilic oesophagitis.\n4.\t Dysphagia, bleeding and weight loss are alarm \nsymptoms: investigation is needed.\n5.\t Heartburn and acid regurgitation typically arise \nfrom gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.\n6.\t Could this abdominal pain be biliary pain? Biliary \npain (‘colic’) is due to gallstones or acute \ncholecystitis; it is acute, severe constant (not \ncolicky) pain that often lasts for hours, usually \narises in the epigastrium or right upper quadrant \nand occurs unpredictably.\n7.\t Chronic or recurrent abdominal pain associated \nwith constipation or diarrhoea, or both, plus \nbloating, in the absence of alarm symptoms, is \nusually due to the irritable bowel syndrome.

WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, Troilus and Cressida\nExamination of the gastrointestinal system includes a \ncomplete examination of the abdomen. It is also \nimportant to search for the peripheral signs of \ngastrointestinal and liver disease. Some signs are more \nuseful than others.1\nEXAMINATION ANATOMY\nAn understanding of the structure and function of the \ngastrointestinal tract and abdominal organs is critical \nfor the diagnosis of gastrointestinal disease (see Fig. \n14.1). The mouth is the gateway to the gastrointestinal \ntract. It and the anus and rectum are readily accessible \nto the examiner, and both must be examined carefully \nin any patient with suspected abdominal disease. The \nposition of the abdominal organs can be quite variable, \nbut there are important surface markings that should \nbe kept in mind during the examination.\nThe liver is the largest organ in the abdomen; it \ncomprises a large right lobe and smaller left lobe divided \ninto eight segments, including the caudate lobe (segment \nI) squeezed in between.

Normally the liver is not palpable, but \nit may just be possible to feel the lower edge in healthy \npeople.\nThe spleen is a lymphoid organ that underlies the \nninth, tenth and eleventh ribs posteriorly on the left. \nIt is usually not palpable in health (see Ch 21).\nThe kidneys lie anteriorly four finger-breadths \nfrom the midline and posteriorly under the twelfth \nrib. Normally, the right kidney extends 2.5 centimetres \nlower than the left. The lower pole of the right kidney \nmay be palpable in thin healthy people.\nThe gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ and the \nfundus (top) is at the tip of the right ninth costal \ncartilage; it cannot be felt in health. The pancreas is \nsituated in the retroperitoneum (behind the peritoneum), \nwith the head tucked into the C-shaped duodenum \nand the tail snuggling into the spleen. A huge pancreatic \nmass may rarely be large enough to be palpable.\nThe aorta lies in the midline and terminates just \nto the left of the midline at the level of the iliac crest. \nA pulsatile mass in the middle of the abdomen is likely \nto be arising from the aorta and may indicate an \naneurysm.\nThe stomach is usually J-shaped and lies in the left \nupper part of the abdomen over the spleen and pancreas; \nit connects with the duodenum. The small intestine \nranges from 3 to 10 metres in length and comprises \nthe upper half (duodenum and jejunum) and the lower \nhalf (ileum). The small intestine lies over the middle \nsection of the abdomen but is usually impalpable.\nThe colon is approximately 1.5 metres in length, \nand from right to left consists of the caecum, ascending \ncolon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, splenic flexure, \ndescending colon, sigmoid colon, rectum and anal canal \n(anorectum). The appendix usually lies in the right \nlower abdominal area, arising posterior-medially from \nthe caecum. The caecum and ascending colon lie on the \nright side of the abdomen, the transverse colon runs \nacross the upper abdomen from right to left, and then \nthe descending colon, sigmoid and rectum lie on the \nleft side of the abdomen. Rarely, masses arising from \nthe colon will be felt in the abdomen.\nOther important anatomical areas include the \ninguinal canal and the anorectum, which are described \nlater in this chapter in relation to examination of hernias \nand the rectal examination.\nPOSITIONING THE PATIENT\nFor proper examination of the abdomen it is important \nthat the patient lies flat with the head resting on a \nsingle pillow (see Fig. 14.2). This relaxes the abdominal \nmuscles and facilitates abdominal palpation. Helping \nthe patient into this position affords the opportunity \nto make a general inspection.\nGENERAL APPEARANCE\nJaundice\nThe yellow discoloration of the sclerae (conjunctivae) \nand the skin that results from hyperbilirubinaemia is \nbest observed in natural daylight (p 40).

Mayo Clinic images in internal medicine, \nwith permission. © Mayo Clinic Scientific Press and CRC Press. \nReproduced by permission of Taylor and Francis Group, LLC, a \ndivision of Informa plc.)\nFIGURE 14.9\nc\t These changes were first described by Dr Richard Terry in 1954 in association \nwith cirrhosis. They are also found in patients with cardiac failure and \nbecome more common in normal people with age. In a patient under \nthe age of 50, their presence indicates cirrhosis, heart failure or diabetes, \nwith a likelihood ratio of 5.3.\n Palmar erythema \n(From Goldman L, Schafer AI. Goldman’s Cecil medicine, 24th edn. \nPhiladelphia: Saunders, 2011.)\nFIGURE 14.10\nintrahepatic) causes this syndrome. It is probably related \nto the liver’s failure to remove toxic metabolites from \nthe portal blood. These toxic metabolites may include \nammonia, mercaptans, short-chain fatty acids and \namines.\nHANDS\nEven experienced gastroenterologists must restrain \ntheir excitement and begin the examination of the \ngastrointestinal tract with the hands. The signs that \nmay be elicited here give a clue to the presence of \nchronic liver disease. Whatever its aetiology, permanent \ndiffuse liver damage results in similar peripheral signs. \nHowever, none of these signs alone is specific for chronic \nliver disease.\nNails\nLeuconychia\nWhen chronic liver or other disease results in \nhypoalbuminaemia, the nail beds opacify (the \nabnormality is of the nail bed and not of the nail), \noften leaving only a rim of pink nail bed at the top of \nthe nail (Terry’s nails;c see Fig. 14.9). The thumb and \nindex nails are most often involved. The underlying \nmechanism may be compression of capillary flow by \nextracellular fluid.\nMuehrcke’s lines (transverse white lines) can also \noccur in hypoalbuminaemic states, including cirrhosis. \nBlue lunulae may be seen in patients with Wilson’s \ndisease (hepatolenticular degeneration).\nClubbing\nUp to one-third of patients with cirrhosis may have \nfinger clubbing. In at least some cases, this may be \nrelated to arteriovenous (AV) shunting in the lungs, \nresulting in arterial oxygen desaturation.

It may \nalso be a normal finding, especially in women, and \nlike spider naevi can occur in pregnancy.\nAnaemia\nInspect the palmar creases for pallor suggesting \nanaemia, which may result from gastrointestinal blood \nloss, malabsorption (folate, vitamin B12), haemolysis \n(e.g. hypersplenism) or chronic disease.\nDupuytren’s contracture\nDupuytren’s contractured is a visible and palpable \nthickening and contraction of the palmar fascia causing \npermanent flexion, most often of the ring finger (see \nFig. 14.11). It is often bilateral and occasionally affects \nthe feet. It is associated with alcoholism (not liver \ndisease), but is also found in some manual workers; it \nis often familial. The palmar fascia of these patients \ncontains abnormally large amounts of xanthine, and \nthis may be related to the pathogenesis.\nHepatic flap (asterixise)\nBefore leaving the hands ask the patient to stretch \nout his or her arms in front, separate the fingers and \nextend the wrists for 15 seconds. Push on the patient’s \nfingers to keep them extended (see Fig. 14.12). Jerky, \nirregular flexion–extension movements at the wrist \nand metacarpophalangeal joints, often accompanied \nby lateral movements of the fingers, constitute the \nflapping of hepatic encephalopathy (asterixis).\nAsterixis is thought to be due to interference with \nthe inflow of joint position sense information to the \nreticular formation in the brainstem. This results in \nrhythmical lapses of postural muscle tone. Occasionally \nthe arms, neck, tongue, jaws and eyelids can also be \ninvolved. It can sometimes be demonstrated if the \npatient is asked to close the eyes forcefully or to protrude \nthe tongue.\nThe flap is bilateral, tends to be absent at rest and \nis brought on by sustained posture. The rhythmic \nmovements are not synchronous on each side and the \nflap is absent when coma supervenes.\nAlthough this flap is a characteristic and early sign \nof liver failure, it is not diagnostic: it can also occur \nin cardiac, respiratory and renal failure, as well as in \nhypoglycaemia, hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia or \nbarbiturate intoxication.\n",

Spider \nnaevi may occur transiently in viral hepatitis.

Part of the normal hepatic function \nis the inactivation of oestrogens, which is impaired in \nchronic liver disease. Oestrogens are known to have a \ndilating effect on the spiral arterioles of the endometrium, \nand this has been used to explain the presence of spider \nnaevi, but changes in plasma oestradiol levels have not \nbeen found to correlate with the appearance and \ndisappearance of spider naevi.\nThe differential diagnosis of spider naevi includes \nCampbell de Morganh spots, venous stars and hereditary \nhaemorrhagic telangiectasia.

It occurs frequently in respiratory tract \ninfections, but is in no way related to constipation or \nany serious abdominal disorder.\nLingua nigra (black tongue) is due to elongation of \npapillae over the posterior part of the tongue, which \nappears dark brown because of the accumulation of \nkeratin. Apart from its aesthetic problems it is \nsymptomless. Bismuth compounds may also cause a \nblack discoloration of the tongue.\nGeographical tongue is a term used to describe slowly \nchanging red rings and lines that occur on the surface \nof the tongue. It is not painful, and the condition tends \nto come and go. It is not usually of any significance, \nbut can be a sign of riboflavin (vitamin B2) deficiency.\nLeucoplakia (see Fig. 14.21) is white-coloured \nthickening of the mucosa of the tongue and mouth; \nthe condition is premalignant. Most of the causes of \nleucoplakia begin with ‘S’: sore teeth (poor dental \nhygiene), smoking, spirits, sepsis or syphilis, but often \nno cause is apparent. Leucoplakia may also occur on \nthe larynx, anus and vulva.\nThe term glossitis (see Fig. 14.22) is generally used \nto describe a smooth appearance of the tongue, which \nmay also be erythematous. The appearance is due to \natrophy of the papillae, and in later stages there may \nbe shallow ulceration. These changes occur in the tongue \noften as a result of nutritional deficiencies to which \nthe tongue is sensitive because of the rapid turnover \nof mucosal cells. Deficiencies of iron, folate and the \nvitamin B group, especially vitamin B12, are common \ncauses. Glossitis is common in alcoholics and can also \noccur in the rare carcinoid syndrome. However, many \ncases, especially those in elderly people, are impossible \nto explain.\nEnlargement of the tongue (macroglossia) may occur \nin congenital conditions such as Down syndrome or \nin endocrine disease, including acromegaly. Tumour \ninfiltration (e.g. haemangioma or lymphangioma) or \ninfiltration of the tongue with amyloid material in \namyloidosis can also be responsible for macroglossia.\nMouth ulcers\nThis is an important topic because a number of systemic \ndiseases can present with ulcers in the mouth (see List \n14.5). Aphthous ulceration is the most common type \nseen (see Fig. 14.23). This begins as a small painful \nvesicle on the tongue or mucosal surface of the mouth, \nwhich may break down to form a painful, shallow ulcer. \nThese ulcers heal without scarring.

Look at the shape of the \numbilicus, which may give a clue to the underlying \ncause. An umbilicus buried in fat suggests that the \npatient eats too much. However, when the peritoneal \ncavity is filled with large volumes of fluid (ascites) from \nwhatever cause, the abdominal flanks and wall appear \ntense and the umbilicus is shallow or everted and points \ndownwards. In pregnancy the umbilicus is pushed \nupwards by the uterus enlarging from the pelvis. This \nappearance may also result from a huge ovarian cyst.\nLocal swellings may indicate enlargement of one of \nthe abdominal or pelvic organs. A hernia is a protrusion \nof an intra-abdominal structure through an abnormal \nopening; this may occur because of weakening of the \nabdominal wall by previous surgery (incisional hernia), \na congenital abdominal wall defect or chronically \nincreased intra-abdominal pressure.\nProminent veins may be obvious on the abdominal \nwall. If these are present, the direction of venous flow \nshould be elicited at this stage. Use one finger to occlude \nthe vein and then empty blood from the vein below \nthe occluding finger with a second finger. Remove the \nsecond finger; if the vein refills, flow is occurring \ntowards the occluding finger (see Fig. 14.30). Flow \nshould be tested separately in veins above and below \nthe umbilicus.\nIn patients with severe portal hypertension, portal \nto systemic flow occurs through the umbilical veins, \nwhich may become engorged and distended (see Fig. \n14.31).

Usually only one or two veins (often \nepigastric) are visible. Engorgement can also occur \nbecause of inferior vena caval obstruction, usually due \nto a tumour or thrombosis but sometimes because of \ntense ascites. In this case the abdominal veins enlarge \nto provide collateral blood flow from the legs, avoiding \nthe blocked inferior vena cava. The direction of flow \nis then upwards towards the heart.

During \ninspiration the hand is kept still and the lateral margin \nof the forefinger waits expectantly for the liver edge to \nstrike it.\nThe edge of the liver and the surface itself may be \nhard or soft, tender or non-tender, regular or irregular \nand pulsatile or non-pulsatile. The normal liver edge \nmay be just palpable below the right costal margin on \ndeep inspiration, especially in thin people. The edge \nis then felt to be soft and regular with a fairly sharply \ndefined border and the surface of the liver itself is \nsmooth. Sometimes only the left lobe of the liver may \nbe palpable (to the left of the midline) in patients with \ncirrhosis.\nIf the liver edge is palpable the total liver span can \nbe measured. Remember that the liver span varies with \nheight and is greater in men than women, and that \ninter-observer error is quite large for this measurement. \nThe normal upper border of the liver is level with the \nsixth intercostal space in the midclavicular line. At this \npoint the percussion note over the chest changes from \nresonant to dull (see Fig. 14.37(a)). To estimate the \nliver span (see Fig. 14.37(b)), percuss down along the \nright midclavicular line until the liver dullness is \nencountered and measure from here to the palpable \nliver edge. Careful assessment of the position of the \nmidclavicular line will improve the accuracy of this \nmeasurement. The normal span is less than 13 \ncentimetres. Note that the clinical estimate of the liver \nspan usually underestimates its actual size by 2 to 5 \ncentimetres.\nOther causes of a normal but palpable liver include \nptosis due to emphysema, asthma or a subdiaphragmatic \ncollection, or a Riedel’s lobe.u The Riedel’s lobe is a \ntongue-like projection of the liver from the right lobe’s \ninferior surface; it can be quite large and rarely extends \nas far as the right iliac fossa.

The patient lies flat on his or her back. To \npalpate the right kidney, slide your left hand underneath \nthe patient’s back to rest with the heel of the hand \nunder the right loin. The fingers remain free to flex \nat the metacarpophalangeal joints in the area of the \nrenal angle. The flexing fingers can push the contents \nof the abdomen anteriorly. Place your right hand over \nthe right upper quadrant.\nFirst an attempt should be made to capture the \nkidney between both hands. It is more often possible to \nfeel a kidney by bimanual palpation (this is traditionally \ncalled ballotting, although this term should probably \nbe reserved for palpation of an organ or a mass in a \nfluid medium). In this case the renal angle is pressed \nsharply by the flexing fingers of the posterior hand \n(Fig. 14.40). It is important that the posterior hand is \nplaced almost as far posterior as the spine and not just \nin the flank. The kidney can be felt to float upwards \nand strike the anterior hand. The opposite hands are \nused to palpate the left kidney.\nWhen palpable, the kidney feels like a swelling with \na rounded lower pole and a medial dent (the hilum). \nHowever, it is unusual for a normal kidney to be felt \nas clearly as this. The lower pole of the right kidney \nmay be palpable in thin, healthy people. Both kidneys \nmove downwards with inspiration.\nIt is particularly common to confuse a large left \nkidney with splenomegaly. The major distinguishing \nfeatures are: (1) the spleen has no palpable upper \nborder—the space between the spleen and the costal \nmargin, which is present in renal enlargement, cannot \nbe felt; (2) the spleen, unlike the kidney, has a notch \nthat may be palpable; (3) the spleen moves inferomedially \non inspiration whereas the kidney moves inferiorly; \n(4) the spleen is not usually ballottable unless gross \nascites is present, but the kidney is, again because of \nits retroperitoneal position; (5) the percussion note is \ndull over the spleen but is usually resonant over the \nkidney, as the latter lies posterior to loops of gas-filled \nbowel; and (6) a friction rub may occasionally be heard \nover the spleen, but never over the kidney because it \nis too posterior.\nOther abdominal masses\nThe causes of a mass in the abdomen, excluding the \nliver, spleen and kidneys, are summarised in List 14.9.\nGallbladder\nThe gallbladder is occasionally palpable below the \nright costal margin where this crosses the lateral \nborder of the rectus muscles. If biliary obstruction or \nacute cholecystitis is suspected, the examining hand \nshould be oriented perpendicular to the costal margin, \nfeeling from medial to lateral. Unlike the liver edge, \nthe gallbladder, if palpable, will be a bulbous, focal, \nrounded mass that moves downwards on inspiration. \nThe causes of an enlarged gallbladder are listed in \nList 14.10.\nMurphy’sw sign should be sought if cholecystitis is \nsuspected. On taking a deep breath, the patient catches \nhis or her breath when an inflamed gallbladder presses \non the examiner’s hand, which is lying at the costal \nmargin. Other signs are less helpful. An alternative \ntechnique is to stand behind the patient and place your \nright hand under the right costal margin while the \npatient takes a deep breath in.\nWhen examining for an enlarged gallbladder always \nbe mindful of Courvoisier’sx law, which states that, if \nw\t John Murphy (1857–1916), an American surgeon and professor of surgery \nat Rush Medical College, Chicago, described this in 1912.\nx\t Ludwig Courvoisier (1843–1918), a professor of surgery in Switzerland, \ndescribed this principle in 1890.

A divarication of the rectus sheath \nwill be obvious when a patient sits up (see Fig. 14.42). \nThis weakness in the abdominal wall aponeurosis is \nvery common and causes bulging of the central part of \nthe abdomen when intra-abdominal pressure increases.\nPain can arise from the abdominal wall; this can \ncause confusion with intra-abdominal causes of pain. \nTo test for abdominal wall pain, feel for an area of \nlocalised tenderness that reproduces the pain while \nthe patient is supine.

Percuss over the lowest intercostal space in the \nleft anterior axillary line in both inspiration and \nexpiration with the patient supine (see Fig. 14.43). \nSplenomegaly should be suspected if the percussion \nnote is dull or becomes dull on complete inspiration. \nIf the percussion note is dull, palpation should be \nrepeated (see also Ch 21 for another method for \ndetecting splenomegaly).\nKidneys\nPercussion over a right or left subcostal mass can help \ndistinguish hepatic or splenic from renal masses: in the \nlatter case there will usually be a resonant area because \nof overlying bowel (be warned, however, that sometimes \na very large renal mass may displace overlying bowel).\nBladder\nAn area of suprapubic dullness indicates the upper \nborder of an enlarged bladder or pelvic mass.\nAscites\nThe percussion note over most of the abdomen is \nresonant, due to air in the intestines.11 The resonance \nis detectable out to the flanks. When peritoneal fluid \n(ascites) collects, the influence of gravity causes this \nto accumulate first in the flanks in a supine patient. \nThus, a relatively early sign of ascites (when at least 2 \nlitres of fluid have accumulated) is a dull percussion \nnote in the flanks (see Good signs guide 14.2). When \nascites is gross, the abdomen distends, the flanks bulge, \numbilical eversion occurs (see Fig. 14.29) and dullness \nis detectable closer to the midline. However, an area \nof central resonance will always persist. Routine \nabdominal examination should include percussion \nstarting in the midline with the finger pointing towards \nthe feet; the percussion note is tested out towards the \nflanks on each side.\nIf (and only if) dullness is detected in the flanks, \nthe sign of shifting dullness (see Fig. 14.44) should \nbe sought.11 To detect this sign, while standing on \nthe right side of the bed percuss out to the left flank \nuntil dullness is reached (see Fig. 14.45(a)). This \npoint should be marked (usually by leaving a finger \nover the spot) and the patient rolled towards you. \nIdeally 30 seconds to 1 minute should then pass so \nthat fluid can move inside the abdominal cavity and \nthen percussion is repeated over the marked point \n(see Fig. 14.45(b)).\nShifting dullness is present if the area of dullness \nhas changed to become resonant.

The \nliver and spleen may become ballottable when gross \nascites is present.\nAuscultation\nWhile some cardiologists believe that the sounds \nproduced in the abdominal cavity are not as varied or \nas interesting as those one hears in the chest, they have \nsome value.\nBowel sounds\nPlace the diaphragm of the stethoscope just below the \numbilicus. Bowel sounds can be heard over all parts \nof the abdomen in healthy people (see Fig. 14.46). They \nare poorly localised and there is little point in listening \nfor them in more than one place. Most bowel sounds \noriginate in the stomach, some from the large bowel \nand the rest from the small bowel. They have a soft \ngurgling character and occur only intermittently. Bowel \nsounds should be described as either present or absent; \nthe terms ‘decreased’ or ‘increased’ are meaningless \nbecause the sounds vary, depending on when a meal \nwas last eaten.\nComplete absence of any bowel sounds over a \n4-minute period indicates paralytic ileus (this is \ncomplete absence of peristalsis in a paralysed bowel). \nAs only liquid is present in the gut, the heart sounds \nmay be audible over the abdomen, transmitted by the \ndilated bowel.\nThe bowel that is obstructed produces a louder and \nhigher-pitched sound with a tinkling quality due to \nthe presence of air and liquid (‘obstructed bowel \nsounds’). The presence of normal bowel sounds makes \nobstruction unlikely. Intestinal hurry or rush, which \noccurs in diarrhoeal states, causes loud gurgling sounds, \noften audible without the stethoscope.

However, this syndrome was actually first \ndescribed by C Stajano in 1920.\nliver capsule (Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndromez). A splenic \nrub indicates a splenic infarct.\nVenous hums\nA venous hum is a continuous, low-pitched, soft murmur \nthat may become louder with inspiration and diminish \nwhen more pressure is applied to the stethoscope. \nTypically it is heard between the xiphisternum and \nthe umbilicus in cases of portal hypertension, but is \nrare. It may radiate to the chest or over to the liver. \nLarge volumes of blood flowing in the umbilical or \nparaumbilical veins in the falciform ligament are \nresponsible. These channel blood from the left portal \nvein to the epigastric or internal mammary veins in \nthe abdominal wall. A venous hum may occasionally \nbe heard over the large vessels such as the inferior \nmesenteric vein or after portacaval shunting. Sometimes \na thrill is detectable over the site of maximum intensity \nof the hum. The Cruveilhier–Baumgarten syndromeaa \nis the association of a venous hum at the umbilicus and \ndilated abdominal wall veins. It is almost always due \nto cirrhosis of the liver. It occurs when patients have a \npatent umbilical vein, which allows portal-to-systemic \nshunting at this site. The presence of a venous hum or \nof prominent central abdominal veins suggests that the \nsite of portal obstruction is intrahepatic rather than in \nthe portal vein itself.\nBruits\nUncommonly, an arterial systolic bruit can be heard \nover the liver. This sound is higher pitched than a \nvenous hum, is not continuous and is well localised. \nThis is usually due to a hepatocellular cancer but may \noccur in acute alcoholic hepatitis, with an arteriovenous \nmalformation or transiently after a liver biopsy. \nAuscultation for renal bruits on either side of the \nmidline above the umbilicus is indicated if renal artery \nstenosis is suspected. A bruit in the epigastrium may \nbe heard in patients with chronic intestinal ischaemia \nfrom mesenteric arterial stenosis, but may also occur in \nthe absence of pathology. A bruit may occasionally be \naudible over the spleen when there is a tumour of the \nbody of the pancreas or a splenic arteriovenous fistula.\nScratch test\nThe scratch test can help to identify the inferior liver \nborder if the abdomen is very tender, tense or distended. \nPlace the diaphragm of the stethoscope below the \nxiphoid and lightly but briskly stroke the skin in a \ndirection at right angles to the expected liver edge, \nstarting at the right lower quadrant and working slowly \nup to the right costal margin along the midclavicular \nline. When the liver edge is reached, the sound of the \nscratch is transmitted to the stethoscope. The point of \ninitial (not maximal) sound transmission is most helpful \nin identifying the liver edge. This test has been \ncontroversial but is reliable with moderate accuracy \n(versus abdominal ultrasound).12,13\nHERNIAS\nHernias are of surgical importance and should not be \nmissed during an abdominal examination. They are \nvery frequently the focus of student assessment \nexaminations.\nExamination anatomy\nYou need to know the anatomy of the inguinal and \nfemoral canal. A key anatomical landmark is the pubic \ntubercle (or pubic spine), a palpable round nodule \n(tubercle) on the upper border of the medial portion \nof the superior ramus of the pubis (a midline \ncartilaginous joint uniting the superior rami of the left \nand right pubic bones). The inguinal ligament attaches \nto the pubic tubercle (see Fig. 14.47). Find the femoral \nartery pulsation and go medially to identify the tubercle. \nThe pubic tubercle can usually easily be felt lateral to \nthe symphysis pubis (2–3 centimetres from the midline). \nIn the obese individual, it may be difficult to locate \nthe pubic tubercle; in such situations, if the thigh is \nflexed and abducted, the adductor longus muscle can \nbe traced proximally, leading you to the pubic tubercle.\nFrom the pubic tubercle to the anterior superior \niliac spine lies the inguinal canal. At the mid-inguinal \npoint (midway between the pubic symphysis and the \nanterior superior iliac spine) is an internal ring. At \nthe pubic tubercle lies an external ring, in men the \ngateway to the scrotum. Remember that the femoral \n",

Another term used \nfor irreducible is incarcerated, but this term is best \navoided. Some irreducible hernias contain bowel, which \nmay become obstructed, giving rise to symptoms of \nsmall-bowel obstruction in addition to the irreducible \nlump. Sometimes the bowel contents’ blood supply \nbecomes jeopardised, and these are known as \nstrangulated hernias; they are usually painful, red, tense \nand tender.\nInguinal hernias typically bulge above the crease of \nthe groin. The lump is found medial to the pubic \ntubercle, above the inguinal ligament (remember, \ninguinal = medial and above). Inguinal hernias may be \nindirect or direct. Indirect inguinal hernias are by far \nthe most common groin hernia. The bowel follows the \ninguinal canal, bulging through the internal ring and \nsometimes out through the external ring. Direct \ninguinal hernias are usually the result of a muscular \ndefect of the inguinal canal (an area known as \nHesselbach’s triangle,bb bounded inferiorly by the \ninguinal ligament, laterally by the inferior epigastric \nvessels and medially by the lateral border of the rectus \nsheath). Usually the hernia does not reach the scrotum. \nHowever, differentiating a direct from an indirect hernia \nis difficult based on clinical signs alone.\nA femoral hernia bulges through the femoral ring \ninto the femoral canal.

Ask the patient to cough again while \nyou inspect the opposite side.\n6.\tPalpation. Place your fingers over the region of \nthe pubic tubercle. Once again the patient is \nasked to cough and a palpable expansile impulse \nis sought. If a hernia is present, attempts at \nreduction should not be performed while the \npatient is erect, as it is more difficult and painful \nthan when the patient is placed supine.\n7.\tLay the patient supine. Ask the patient to lie \nsupine on the examination couch. Perform the \nprocedure of inspection and palpation in the \nsame manner again. The exact position of any \nhernia is usually easier to define with the patient \nlying supine.\n8.\tIdentify the hernia type. If a lump is present, it \nmust be determined whether this is a hernia and, \nif so, what sort of hernia. Identify the pubic \ntubercle. Remember, one cannot get above a \nhernia, but one can get above a hydrocele in the \ninguinal canal. Try to determine whether the \nhernia is inguinal (see Fig. 14.48) or femoral \nbased on the position in relation to the pubic \ntubercle and inguinal ligament (see above).\nRemember, femoral hernias are more \ndangerous: they are usually smaller and firmer \nthan inguinal hernias and commonly do not \nexhibit a cough impulse. Because they are \nfrequently irreducible they are commonly \nmistaken for an enlarged inguinal lymph node. A \ncough impulse is rare from a femoral hernia and \nneeds to be distinguished from the thrill produced \nby a saphena varix when a patient coughs.\n9.\tIn a male, examine the testes and scrotum. A \nlarge inguinal hernia may descend through the \nexternal ring immediately above the pubic \ntubercle into the scrotum. Gentle invagination of \nthe scrotum with the tip of the gloved finger in \nthe external ring may be performed to confirm \nan indirect hernia in men, but this can be \ndifficult to interpret without substantial \nexperience (see Fig. 14.49). A maldescended \ntestis can be confused with an inguinal hernia; \n",

A large inguinal hernia may present as \na lump in the scrotum. It is important to \nascertain whether one can get above the lump. If \nyou can get above the lump, the lump is of \nprimary intrascrotal pathology and is not a \nhernia.\nEpigastric hernia\nA hernia in the epigastric region is common in older \npatients. This can be identified by asking the patient \nto do half a sit-up from the supine position and looking \nfor an obvious bulge. Identify scars that may explain \nthe abdominal wall weakness. Ask the patient whether \nthe lump is painful and palpate it. Feel for a cough \nimpulse.

Following an explanation as to what is to \nhappen and why, the patient lies on his or her left side \nwith the knees drawn up and back to the examiner. \nThis is called the left lateral position. The examination \ncan be performed with the patient standing and in \nthe bent-over position; this may help provide good \ninformation about the prostate, but makes assessment \nof rectal function more difficult.\nDon a pair of gloves and begin the inspection of \nthe anus and perianal area by separating the buttocks. \nThe following must be looked for:\n1.\tThrombosed external haemorrhoids (piles). \nSmall (less than 1 centimetre), tense bluish \nswellings may be seen on one side of the \nanal margin. They are painful and are due to \nrupture of a vein in the external haemorrhoidal \nplexus. They are also called perianal \nhaematomas.\n2.\tSkin tags. These look like tags elsewhere on the \nbody and can be an incidental finding or occur \nwith haemorrhoids or Crohn’s disease.\n3.\tRectal prolapse. Circumferential folds of red \nmucosa are visible protruding from the anus. \nThese may become apparent only when the \npatient is asked to strain as if to pass stool. If \nthere is rectal prolapse, straining may cause a \ndark red mass to appear at the anal verge; \n",

The \npresence of a gaping anus often correlates with lower \nresting pressures on anorectal manometry. Internal \nhaemorrhoids can prolapse in the right anterior, right \nposterior and left lateral positions.\nNow test the anal wink. Stroke a cotton pad in all \nfour quadrants around the anus. Usually you will see \na brisk anal contraction that indicates the sacral nerve \npathways are intact. Sometimes the response is weak \nin healthy people. However, the complete absence of \nan anal wink, particularly in the setting of faecal \nincontinence, suggests that there is a spinal cord \nproblem and indicates the need to perform a more \ndetailed neurological examination and consider further \ninvestigations accordingly.\nNow the time for action has come. Lubricate the \ntip of your gloved right index finger and place it over \nthe patient’s anus. Ask the patient to breathe in and \nout quietly through the mouth, as a distraction and to \naid relaxation.\nIf the patient feels excruciating pain at the start of \nthe examination, this strongly suggests that there is an \nanal fissure and the remainder of the rectal examination \nshould be abandoned. Often the fissure can be seen \non inspection. An anal fissure can precipitate \nconstipation but may be secondary to constipation \nitself. By liberally lubricating the rectum with lignocaine \njelly, it may still be possible to complete the rest of the \nexamination, but usually it is better to perform anoscopy \nunder appropriate sedation for these patients. Other \ncauses of significant anal pain during palpation include \nrecently thrombosed external haemorrhoids, an \nischiorectal abscess, active proctitis or anal ulceration \nfrom another cause.\nUnless the patient feels pain, slowly increase the \npressure applied with the pulp of your finger until the \nsphincter is felt to relax slightly. At this stage advance \nyour finger into the rectum slowly. During entry, \nsphincter tone should be assessed as normal or reduced. \nThe accuracy of this assessment has been questioned in \nthe past, but more recently it has been shown to correlate \nwell with anorectal manometry measurements.16 This \nresting tone is predominantly (70%–80%) attributable to \nthe internal anal sphincter muscle. Reduced sphincter \ntone may indicate a sphincter tear. A high anal resting \ntone may contribute to difficulties with evacuation.\nPalpation of the anterior wall of the rectum for the \nprostate gland in the male and for the cervix in the \nfemale is performed first.

With prostatic enlargement, the sulcus \nbecomes obliterated and the gland is often asymmetrical. \nA very hard nodule is apparent when a carcinoma of \nthe prostate is present. The prostate is boggy and tender \nin prostatitis.

Normally, the anal sphincter \nand puborectalis should relax and the perineum should \ndescend by 1–3.5 centimetres. If the muscles seem to \ntighten, particularly when there is no perineal descent, \nthis suggests paradoxical external anal sphincter and \npuborectalis contraction, which in fact are blocking \nnormal defecation (called pelvic floor dyssynergia or \nanismus). Ask the patient to strain again when your \nfinger is rotated anteriorly. In this position a rectocele \n(a defect in the anterior wall of the rectum) may be \npalpable.\nSecond, press on the posterior rectal wall and ask \nif this causes pain; this suggests puborectalis muscle \ntenderness, which can also occur in pelvic floor \ndyssynergia.\nThird, assess whether the anal sphincter and the \npuborectalis contract when you ask the patient to \ncontract or squeeze the pelvic floor muscles. Puborectalis \ncontraction is perceived as a ‘lift’—that is, the muscle \nlifts the examining finger towards the umbilicus. Many \npatients with faecal incontinence cannot augment anal \npressure when asked to squeeze.\nFinally, place your other hand on the anterior \nabdominal wall while asking the patient to strain again. \nThis provides some information on whether the patient \nis excessively contracting the abdominal wall (e.g. by \nperforming an inappropriate Valsalva manoeuvre) and \nperhaps also the pelvic floor muscles while attempting \nto defecate, which may impede evacuation. However, \nthe exact value of this test is unclear.\nConstipation that is due to pelvic floor dysfunction \nresponds to biofeedback in about 70% of cases, and \nthis treatment can result in a laxative-free existence \nfor patients with troubling outlet constipation; the \ndiagnosis should be entertained in all patients with \nchronic constipation, and a good rectal examination \ncan help guide you as to whether anorectal manometry \ntesting is warranted.\nEnding the rectal exam\nAfter your finger has been withdrawn, inspect the glove \nfor bright blood or melaena, mucus or pus, and note \nthe colour of the faeces. Haemorrhoids are not palpable \nunless thrombosed. Persistent gaping of the anal canal \nafter withdrawal of the examining finger may indicate \nexternal anal sphincter denervation.\nTesting of the stools for blood\nTesting of the stools for blood may be considered in the \nassessment of anaemia, iron deficiency, gastrointestinal \nbleeding or symptoms suggesting colonic cancer, or for \ncolon cancer screening in asymptomatic people. In the \nguaiac test, stool is placed on a guaiac-impregnated \npaper; blood results in phenolytic oxidation, causing \na blue colour.\n",

Vitamin C can reduce \nthe sensitivity of guaiac results and should not be \ntaken before testing. False-negative results are not \nuncommon with colorectal neoplasms because they \nbleed intermittently.

Neurological signs of \nalcoholism (e.g. a coarse tremor) or evidence of \nthiamine deficiency (peripheral neuropathy or memory \nloss) may also be present.\nExamination of the cardiovascular system may be \nhelpful in patients with hepatomegaly. Cardiac failure \nis a common cause of liver enlargement and can even \ncause cirrhosis. Measurement of the patient’s temperature \nis important, especially in an acute abdominal case or \nif there is any suggestion of infection.\nExamine with particular care all lymph node groups, \nthe breasts and chest if there is any evidence of \nmalignant disease such as firm, irregular hepatomegaly.\nEXAMINATION OF THE \nGASTROINTESTINAL \nCONTENTS\nFaeces\nNever miss an opportunity to inspect a patient’s \nfaeces, because considerable information about the \ngastrointestinal tract can be obtained in this way.\nMelaena\nMelaena stools are poorly formed, black and have a \ntarry appearance. They have a very characteristic and \noffensive smell. The cause is the presence of blood \ndigested by gastric acid and colonic bacteria. Melaena \nusually indicates bleeding from the oesophagus, stomach \nor duodenum. The most common cause is acute or \nchronic peptic ulceration. Less often, right-sided colonic \nbleeding and (rarely) small-bowel bleeding can cause \nmelaena. The differential diagnosis of dark stools \nincludes ingestion of iron tablets, bismuth, liquorice \nor charcoal. However, these tend to result in small \nwell-formed non-tarry stools and the offensive smell \nis absent.\nBright-red blood (haematochezia)\nThis appearance usually results from haemorrhage \nfrom the rectum or left colon. Beetroot ingestion can \nsometimes cause confusion. Blood loss may result from \na carcinoma or polyp, an arteriovenous malformation, \ninflammatory bowel disease or diverticular disease. \nIt can occasionally occur with massive upper \ngastrointestinal bleeding. The blood is usually mixed \nin with the bowel motion if it comes from above \nthe anorectum, but if blood appears on the surface \nof the stool or only on the toilet paper this suggests, \nbut does not guarantee, that bleeding is from a local \nrectal cause, such as internal haemorrhoids or a fissure. \nDark-red jelly-like stools may be seen with ischaemic \nbowel.\nSteatorrhoea\nThe stools are usually very pale, offensive, smelly and \nbulky. They float and are difficult to flush away. However, \nthe most common cause of floating stools is gas and \nwater rather than fat.\nSteatorrhoea results from malabsorption of fat. In \nsevere pancreatic disease, oil (triglycerides) may be \npassed per rectum and this is virtually pathognomonic \nof pancreatic steatorrhoea (lipase deficiency). Oil may \nalso be seen when the patient has used a weight-loss \ndrug that induces fat malabsorption (orlistat).\n‘Toothpaste’ stools\nHere the faeces are expressed like toothpaste from a \ntube: the condition is usually due to severe constipation \nwith overflow diarrhoea.

The pale watery stools are of enormous \nvolume and contain mucous debris.\nVomitus\nThe clinician who is fortunate enough to have vomitus \navailable for inspection (ill-informed staff may throw \nout this valuable substance) should not lose the \nopportunity of a detailed examination. There are a \nnumber of interesting types of vomitus.\n‘Coffee grounds’\nAn old blood clot in vomitus has the appearance of \nthe dregs of a good cup of espresso coffee. Unfortunately, \ndarker vomitus is often described as having this \nappearance. This emphasises the need for personal \ninspection. Iron tablets and red wine, not to mention \ncoffee ingestion, can have the same effect on the \nvomitus.\nBright-red blood (haematemesis)\nLook for the presence of fresh clot. It usually \nindicates fresh bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal \ntract.\nYellow-green vomitus\nThis results from the vomiting of bile and upper \nsmall-bowel contents, often when there is obstruction.\nFaeculent vomiting\nHere brown offensive material from the small bowel \nis vomited. It is a late sign of small-intestinal obstruction. \nRecently ingested tea can have the same appearance \nbut lacks the smell.\nBrownish-black fluid in large volumes may be \nvomited in cases of acute dilation of the stomach. A \nsuccussion splash will usually be present. Acute dilation \nmay occur in association with diabetic ketoacidosis \nor following abdominal surgery. It represents a \nmedical emergency because of the risk of aspiration; \nthere is a need for urgent placement of a nasogastric \ntube.\nProjectile vomiting\nThis term describes the act of vomiting itself and may \nindicate pyloric stenosis. It may also occur with raised \nintracranial pressure.\nURINALYSIS\nNote that testing of the urine can be very helpful in \ndiagnosing liver disease.\nStrip colour tests can detect the presence of bilirubin \nand urobilinogen in the urine. False-positive or \nfalse-negative results can occur with vitamin C or even \nexposure to sunlight. An understanding of the reasons \nfor the presence of bilirubin or urobilinogen in the \nurine necessitates an explanation of the metabolism \nof these substances (see Fig. 14.52).\nRed blood cells are broken down by the \nreticuloendothelial system, causing the release of haem, \nwhich is converted to biliverdin and then unconjugated \nbilirubin, a water-insoluble compound. For this reason, \nunconjugated bilirubin released with haemolytic anaemia \nwill not appear in the urine (termed acholuric jaundice).\nUnconjugated bilirubin is transported in the blood \nbound largely to albumin but also to other plasma \nproteins. Unconjugated bilirubin is then taken up by the \nliver cells and transported to the endoplasmic reticulum, \nwhere glucuronyl transferases conjugate bilirubin with \nglucuronide. This results in the formation of conjugated \nbilirubin, which is water soluble. Conjugated bilirubin \nis then concentrated and excreted by the liver cells into \nthe canaliculus.\nConjugated bilirubin is virtually all excreted into \nthe small bowel; it is converted in the terminal ileum \nand colon to urobilinogen, and then to stercobilin. \nStercobilin is responsible for the normal colour of the \nstools with other non-bilirubinoid dietary pigments. \nUp to 20% of urobilinogen is reabsorbed by the bowel, \nand small amounts are excreted in the urine as urinary \nurobilinogen. This can often be normally detected by \nreagent strips.\nTotal biliary obstruction, from whatever cause, \nresults in absence of urinary urobilinogen, as no \nconjugated bilirubin reaches the bowel, resulting in \npale stools (absence of stercobilin). The conjugated \nbilirubin, unable to be excreted (the rate-limiting step), \nleaks from the hepatocytes into the blood and from \nthere is excreted into the urine (normally there is no \nbilirubin detected in urine). This results in dark urine \n(excess conjugated bilirubin). Acute liver damage, as \nin viral hepatitis, may sometimes initially result in \nexcessive urinary urobilinogen, because the liver is \nunable to re-excrete the urobilinogen reabsorbed from \nthe bowel. These changes are summarised in Table 14.2.\n",

SAMUEL JOHNSON, A Dictionary of the English Language (1775)\nEXAMINATION OF THE \nACUTE ABDOMEN\nIt is very important to try to determine whether a \npatient who presents with acute abdominal pain requires \nan urgent operation or whether careful observation \nwith reassessment is the best course of action.1 Note \nwhether the patient has received pain relief (usually \nwith an opiate)—pain relief should not usually be \nwithheld and does not alter the signs sufficiently to \nlead to misdiagnosis.2\nFirst, take note of the general appearance of the \npatient. The patient who is obviously distressed with \npain or who looks unwell often is, and conversely some \nreassurance can be gained if a patient does not look \nsick and appears comfortable.\nAssess the patient’s vital signs immediately and \nrecheck these at frequent intervals. Signs of reduced \ncirculating blood volume and dehydration—including:\n•\t tachycardia\n•\t postural hypotension\n•\t tachypnoea\n•\t vasoconstriction\n•\t sweating\nare of great concern. These signs, when associated with \nabdominal pain, are usually an indication of substantial \nintra-abdominal blood loss (such as a ruptured aortic \naneurysm), substantial fluid losses (e.g. due to acute \npancreatitis) or septic shock (as with a perforated viscus \nor abscess).\nTake the patient’s temperature.\nInspect the abdomen (see Fig. 15.1). Look particularly \nfor lack of movement with respiration, with splinting \nof the abdominal wall muscles. If there is a history of \npossible blunt abdominal trauma look for a seatbelt \nsign (bruising in the distribution of a seatbelt).3 \nNote any abdominal distension, visible peristalsis \nor other lumps and masses, without forgetting the groin \nregion and hernias. Note also any abdominal scars and \nenquire as to their nature and age.\nPalpate very gently. The presence or absence of \nperitonism is first assessed. Peritonism is an inflammation \nthat causes pain when peritoneal surfaces are moved \nrelative to each other (see Good signs guide 15.1). \nTraditionally, rebound tenderness is used to assess whether \nperitonism is present or not. However, if peritonism is \npresent, this test is far more uncomfortable (and cruel) \nthan eliciting tenderness to light percussion. If the patient \nis extremely apprehensive, ask him or her first to cough; \nthe reaction will be a guide to the degree of peritonism \nand also its location. Palpation is then continued slowly, \nbut more deeply if possible and if masses are sought.

The examination will often reveal tenderness \nand guarding in the right iliac fossa. The pain and \ntenderness are usually maximal over McBurney’sa point. \nMcBurney described this point as 3.8 to 5 centimetres \nalong a line from the anterior superior iliac spine to \nthe umbilicus. Rovsing’sb sign is another way of testing \nrebound tenderness. Press over the patient’s left lower \nquadrant, then release quickly; this causes pain in the \nright iliac fossa. The psoas sign is positive when the \npatient lies on the left side and the clinician attempts \nto extend the right hip. If this is painful and resisted, \nthe sign is positive. When the appendix causes pelvic \ninflammation, rectal examination evokes tenderness on \nthe right side. These signs are of variable usefulness.\nRemember that in elderly patients these signs may \nbe reduced or absent.\nAcute abdomen after \nblunt trauma\nYou must assess for intra-abdominal injuries after blunt \ntrauma to the abdomen, such as is common after a \nmotor vehicle accident. A careful clinical assessment to \nlook for shock and abdominal signs should be followed \nby targeted investigations, most notably an emergency \nabdominal ultrasound.3\nTake the patient’s pulse and blood pressure. \nHypotension is an indicator of intra-abdominal injury \n(+ve LR, 5.2). Look for bruising. Note the presence of \nthe seatbelt sign from trauma with bruising over the \narea of impact (LR range for injury, 5.6–9.9). Also look \nfor abdominal distension (LR, 3.8). Palpate for rebound \ntenderness (LR, 6.5) and guarding (LR, 3.7). Note that \nno abdominal tenderness on palpation is insufficient to \nexclude intra-abdominal injury (summary LR, 0.61).\nDo an emergency ultrasound as this is more \naccurate than physical examination. The presence \nof intraperitoneal fluid or organ injury on bedside \nultrasound assessment indicates the need for urgent \nsurgical consultation (LR, 30). A normal ultrasound \nresult is strongly reassuring (LR, 0.26).3\nLIVER DISEASE\nThere are many signs that point to chronic liver disease.\nIn an ileus from any cause, bowel sounds are usually \nreduced or absent.\nRectal and vaginal examinations may be important \nbut the findings are not very helpful for the diagnosis of \nappendicitis or obstruction; note any tenderness (and \nits location), masses or blood loss. Clinical findings \nthat increase the likelihood of an ectopic pregnancy \ninclude tenderness (cervical motion tenderness [LR, 4.9] \nand adnexal tenderness [LR, 1.9]) and a mass (adnexal \nmass [LR, 2.4]).4\nPer rectal blood should make the examiner think \nof acute colitis (e.g. Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, \nischaemic colitis or infectious colitis) or of mesenteric \nischaemia. A purulent vaginal discharge suggests salpingitis.\nUrinalysis may show glycosuria and ketonuria in \ndiabetic ketoacidosis (which can cause acute abdominal \npain), haematuria in renal colic, bilirubinuria in \ncholangitis or proteinuria in pyelonephritis.\nExamine the respiratory system for signs of \nconsolidation, a pleural rub or pleural effusion, and \nexamine the cardiovascular system for atrial fibrillation \n(a major cause of embolism to a mesenteric artery). \nExamine the back for evidence of spinal disease that \nmay radiate to the abdomen. Remember that herpes \nzoster may cause abdominal pain before the typical \nvesicles erupt.\nConsider the symptoms and signs of appendicitis1 (see \nGood signs guide 15.3).

A pulse rate of more than 100 beats \nper minute, a systolic blood pressure of less than \n100 mmHg or a 15 mmHg postural fall in systolic \nblood pressure suggests severe recent blood loss.

Urgent resuscitative measures must be \ninstituted.\nDetermining the possible \nbleeding site\nThe causes of acute gastrointestinal haemorrhage are \nlisted in Table 13.1 (see p 225).\nExamine the patient with acute upper gastrointestinal \nbleeding for signs of chronic liver disease and portal \nhypertension. Part of the assessment should include \ninspection of the vomitus and stools and a rectal \nexamination (critical). Melaena on rectal examination \ndefinitely increases the likelihood that a patient has an \nupper gastrointestinal bleed (LR, 25).6\nRemember that, of patients with chronic liver disease \nand upper gastrointestinal bleeding, only about half \nare bleeding from varices. The others are usually \nbleeding from peptic ulceration (either acute or \nchronic). Examine also for evidence of a bleeding \ndiathesis (generalised bruising or petechiae).\nFinally, examine the patient for any evidence \nof skin lesions that can be associated with vascular \nanomalies in the gastrointestinal tract, although these \nare rare (see Table 13.1 on p 225 and Table 14.1 on \np 233). For example, pseudoxanthoma elasticum is \nan autosomal recessive disorder of elastic fibres that \nresults in xanthoma-like yellowish nodules, particularly \nin the axillae or neck (see Fig. 15.2). These patients \nmay also have angioid streaks of the optic fundus and \nangiomatous malformations of blood vessels that can \nbleed into the gastrointestinal tract.

If no spleen is felt, percuss over the left \ncostal margin in the left anterior axillary line \nduring complete inspiration (dullness suggests \nsplenomegaly). Always roll the patient onto the \nright side and palpate again if the spleen is not \nfelt initially. Attempt now to feel the kidneys \nbimanually. Remember the important \ndistinguishing features of a spleen as opposed to \na kidney.\nPercuss for ascites only if there is dullness in the \nflanks (and usually this will be obvious). If the \nabdomen is resonant right out to the flanks, do \nnot roll the patient over. Otherwise test for shifting \ndullness. This is performed by percussing away \nfrom your side of the bed until you reach a dull \nnote. Then roll the patient towards you and, after \nwaiting a minute or so, begin percussing again \nfor resonance.\nBy auscultation note the presence of bowel \nsounds. Next auscultate briefly over the liver, \nspleen and renal areas, listening for bruits, hums \nand rubs.\nExamine the patient’s groin next. Palpate for \ninguinal lymphadenopathy. Examine for hernias \nby asking the patient to stand and then cough. \nThe testes should be palpated. Now look at the \nlegs for oedema and bruising.

This will \navoid missing constrictive pericarditis or chronic \ncardiac failure as a cause of liver disease. While \nthe patient is sitting up, palpate in the \nsupraclavicular fossae for lymph nodes and feel \nat the back for sacral oedema. If ascites is \npresent, it is necessary to examine the chest for a \npleural effusion.\nIf malignant disease is suspected, examine all \nlymph node groups, the breasts and the lungs.\nA rectal examination should always be \nconsidered and specimens of the patient’s \nvomitus or faeces should be inspected, if \navailable and symptoms point to abnormalities. \nPerform a urinalysis (for bilirubin and \nurobilinogen, and glucose) and check the \npatient’s temperature.\nEXTENDING THE \nGASTROINTESTINAL \nEXAMINATION\nRadiology, endoscopy, biochemical and special tests \nof function provide important diagnostic and prognostic \ninformation in gastrointestinal and liver diseases. An \nintroduction to testing is provided here.\nEndoscopy\nEndoscopy allows the clinician to extend the physical \nexamination directly into the gastrointestinal tract. The \noesophagus, stomach and duodenum (second part) \nare usually easily reached by a standard gastroscope, \nwhile a colonoscope can reach into the terminal \nileum. Small-bowel enteroscopy allows visualisation \nof the entire small intestine, although this remains \ntechnically challenging, but a small-bowel capsule \nis easily swallowed and provides images of the small \nintestine (e.g. to determine the cause of obscure \ngastrointestinal bleeding). An endoscopic ultrasound \n(where an ultrasound probe is passed through the \nendoscope biopsy channel) allows excellent imaging \nof the pancreas and biliary ducts.\nInspection is a critical endoscopy skill and a \nsystematic approach is key to ensuring that pathology \nis identified correctly.\nIndications for upper endoscopy include dysphagia \n(although a barium swallow may be considered first \nto help guide endoscopic management), odynophagia, \ngastrointestinal bleeding, recurrent vomiting, weight \nloss and heartburn or dyspepsia resistant to treatment. \nThe procedure is also used to determine whether \noesophageal varices are present so that prophylactic \ntreatment can be considered. Colonoscopy is used to \nscreen for colon cancer and investigate unexplained \nlower gastrointestinal symptoms.\nInformed consent is always required prior to the \nprocedure as there are well-defined risks (most notably \nperforation, bleeding and anaesthetic risks).\nRelative contraindications to endoscopy include \nintestinal perforation, severe cardiorespiratory disease \nor obstructive sleep apnoea (as the sedation risk is \n",

As \na simple rule (although no rule is absolute in medicine), \nalways confirm an isolated abnormal blood test value \nbefore marching on to do more intensive investigations.\nWith liver inflammation (e.g. hepatitis), the \nliver transaminase enzymes alanine transaminase \n(ALT [SGPT]) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST \n[SGOT]) both increase. ALT is more liver specific \n(ALT-Liver) and is usually higher than AST in acute \nviral hepatitis. In alcoholic liver disease, AST is higher \nthan ALT (the ratio is about 3 : 1 because alcohol \nspecifically injures mitochondria and AST comes from \nmitochondria).\nAnother indicator of liver dysfunction is the serum \nalkaline phosphatase (SAP), but this enzyme may arise \nfrom the liver (e.g. bile duct obstruction) or bone (e.g. \nmetastases). If the gamma glutamyl transpeptidase \n(GGT) is also increased, this suggests a liver origin, \nas this enzyme rises in parallel with SAP. An ultrasound \nis usually indicated to rule out dilated bile ducts (e.g. \nfrom cancer).\nA low albumin level may indicate that the liver is \nnot synthesising this protein. An elevated international \nnormalised ratio (INR) occurs if there is vitamin K \ndeficiency (e.g. because the liver is not synthesising \nclotting factors II, VII, IX and X).\nIf the liver transaminases are increased, the cause \nneeds to be identified. Review the alcohol history. \nCheck the body mass index (e.g. fatty liver causing \ninflammation: non-alcoholic steatohepatitis). Testing \nfor hepatitis A, B or C and searching for diseases that \ncause infiltration of the liver (e.g. iron overload in \nhaemochromatosis, by testing the serum ferritin and \niron studies) are further steps to consider based on \nthe clinical picture.\nIMAGING THE \nGASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM\nThe three modalities most commonly used in abdom­\ninal imaging are abdominal X-rays Figs 16.2–16.7), \ncomputed tomography (CT) scans (Figs 16.8–16.9) and \nultrasound (Figs 16.9–16.10).\nAbdominal X-rays (see the OCSE \nX-ray library at \n)\nIndications\nPlain film radiographs of the abdomen are indicated \ninitially to identify three conditions: bowel obstruction, \nintraperitoneal free gas and radio-opaque calculi. Up \nto 50% of abdominal aortic aneurysms, 90% of renal \ncalculi and at least 10% of gallstones have enough \ncalcium to be detectable on plain films. Occasionally, \nthe degree of faecal loading may also be assessed with \nan abdominal X-ray. Non-specific abdominal pain \nshould not be an indication for an abdominal X-ray \nexamination.\nTechnique of examination\nThe routine radiographic assessment of the abdomen \nincludes supine AP, erect AP and PA erect chest X-rays. \nIf the patient is unable to be placed upright, a left lateral \ndecubitus is substituted. The term KUB is occasionally \napplied to an abdominal X-ray, denoting Kidneys, \nUreters and Bladder. All three images should be \ninterpreted systematically.\nPrinciples of interpretation\nInterpretation of the plain radiograph requires \nknowledge of basic anatomy and pathological processes. \nThe soft-tissue density of the abdominal organs is similar \nto that of water. Therefore, they are not usually visible \nunless outlined by fat or adjacent gas. For example, \nfluid-filled bowel is not visible, but the bowel walls \nare outlined by the contained gas.\nThe five fundamental radiographic densities \nthat need to be interpreted are gas, fat, solid organ, \ncalcification and metal (see Table 16.1). Because of the \nintrinsic lack of contrast in the abdomen, radio-opaque \ncontrast media are used to highlight various organs. \nBarium meals, barium enemas, intravenous urograms \nand arteriograms are contrast studies.\nReading an abdominal X-ray\nAs with chest X-rays, the name and date should be \nchecked. The left and right sides should be easily \ndistinguished by the stomach gas on the left and the \n",

The main advantages of CT are \nthe short time required for image acquisition, the \nexquisite anatomical detail provided, the wide limits \nof body coverage and the ability to assess blood vessels \nand perfusion characteristics of organs and lesions. \nPatient morbidity is mainly related to the radiation dose \nincurred and to complications from the intravenous \niodinated contrast such as renal failure and allergic \nreactions.\nTechnique of examination\nImages are obtained in a transverse plane (axial) in a \ncontinuous spiral as the patient is moved through the \nimaging beam. As the X-ray passes through the patient \nit decreases in energy (is attenuated) according to the \ntissue density and is registered on a row of detectors \nand converted into a density. Once a body area has \nbeen scanned the data can be recalculated into any \ndensity or plane including three-dimensional renditions. \nMulti-row CT scanners allow more rapid acquisition \nwith thinner slices. This allows the detection of more \ndetail and smaller abnormalities.\nIntravenous contrast containing iodine is injected \nto improve organ depiction, identify blood vessels and \nshow vascularity. Oral contrast is given to show \nintestinal details.\nMany variations in CT technique can be obtained \nto optimise the depiction of abnormalities (see Table \n16.4, Figs 16.8, 16.9a, 16.11).\nPrinciples of interpretation\nFirst, the initial scanogram of the abdomen should \nbe reviewed, because in up to 10% of cases the \ndiagnosis can be made or modified by the findings. \nSecond, an overview of the entire scan is performed \nslice by slice, to identify any major abnormalities such \nas bowel loop dilation, ascites, organomegaly, aortic \naneurysm or mass. Third, an organ-by-organ analysis \nis completed to check its size, margins, enhancement \ncharacteristics and any mass lesion. At the periphery \nof each normal organ the transition from the surface \nto the adjacent fat should be sharp and distinct—a \nfeature that if absent frequently denotes inflammatory \nchange, haemorrhage or tumour infiltration. Fourth, \nfree fluid and free gas are identified by surveying the \nsubdiaphragmatic spaces, paracolic gutters, renal \nrecesses and the pelvis. Finally, change the image setting \nto the lung window to view basal pathology such as \npleural effusion, hiatus hernia and tumours or to the \nbone window to view the spine, ribs and bony pelvis \noptimally.\nPancreatic pseudo-cyst \nFIGURE 16.8 \n",

The patient may have noticed hesitancy \n(difficulty starting micturition—urination), followed \nby a decrease in the size of the stream of urine and \nterminal dribbling of urine. Strangury (recurrently, \na small volume of bloody urine is passed with a \npainful desire to urinate each time) and pis-en-\ndeux / double-voiding (the desire to urinate despite \nhaving just done so) may occur.4 When obstruction is \ncomplete there may be overflow incontinence of urine. \nObstruction is associated with an increased risk of \nurinary infection.\nRenal calculi can cause ureteric obstruction (see \nFig. 19.2 on p 322). The presenting symptom here, \nhowever, is usually severe colicky or constant loin or \nlower quadrant pain that may radiate down towards \nthe symphysis pubis or perineum or testis (renal colic). \nSometimes the main symptoms are abdominal pain \nand nausea and the condition must be distinguished \nfrom an acute abdomen. Urinary obstruction can be \na cause of acute kidney injury (AKI, or renal failure; \nsee List 17.5).\nUrinary incontinence\nThis is the inability to hold urine in the bladder \nvoluntarily. It is not a consequence of normal ageing \nalone. The problem can occur transiently with UTIs, \ndelirium, excess urine output (e.g. from the use of \ndiuretics), immobility (because patients are unable to \nreach the toilet), urethritis or vaginitis, or stool \nimpaction.\nCauses of established urinary incontinence include:\n1.\tStress incontinence (instantaneous leakage after \nthe stress of coughing or after a sudden rise in \nintra-abdominal pressure of any cause)—this \nproblem is more common in women owing to \nvaginal deliveries or an atrophic vaginal wall \npostmenopause causing a hypermobile urethra.\n2.\tUrge incontinence (overactivity of the detrusor \nmuscle), which is characterised by an intense \nurge to urinate and then leakage of urine in the \nabsence of cough or other stressors—this occurs \nin both men and women.\n3.\tDetrusor underactivity—this is rare and is \ncharacterised by urinary frequency, nocturia and \nthe frequent leaking of small amounts of urine \nfrom neurological disease.\n4.\tOverflow incontinence (urethral obstruction)—this \noccurs typically in men with disease of the \nprostate and is characterised by dribbling \nincontinence after incomplete urination.\n5.\tA vesico / urethral fistula—a complication of \nobstructed labour.\nChronic kidney disease\nThe clinical features of chronic kidney disease (CKD; \nchronic renal failure) can be deduced in part by \nconsidering the normal functions of the kidneys.\n1.\t Failure of excretory function leads to \naccumulation of numerous ‘uraemic’ toxins, \nhence the widely used term uraemia. This \nfrequently leads to malaise, lethargy, anorexia, \nmalnutrition and hiccups.a\n(Adapted from Simel DL, Rennie D. The rational clinical \nexamination: evidence-based diagnosis.

The source of the kidney \nmay affect the patient and family psychologically (e.g. \nearly failure of a graft donated by a relative).\nMENSTRUAL AND \nSEXUAL HISTORY\nSexual history taking can be embarrassing for the \npatient (and student); unless it is very relevant to the \npresenting problem, it should probably be left to a \nsecond or later interview. By this time the patient and \nclinician will have become more used to each other and \nthe questions are likely to seem less intrusive.\nFor the menstrual history, the menarche or date \nof the first period is important. The regularity of the \nperiods over the preceding months or years and the \ndate of the last period are also both relevant. The patient \nmay complain of dysmenorrhoea (painful menstruation) \nor menorrhagia (an abnormally heavy period or series \nof periods).\nVaginal discharge can occur in patients with \ninfections of the genital tract. Sometimes the type \nof discharge is an indication of the type of infection \npresent. The history of the number of pregnancies and \nbirths is relevant: gravidity refers to the number of \ntimes a woman has conceived, while parity refers to the \nnumber of babies delivered (live births or stillbirths). \nAlso ask about any complications that occurred during \npregnancy (e.g. hypertension).\nThe sexual history is also relevant.7 Ask about \ncontraceptive methods and the possibility of pregnancy.8 \nAsk men about erectile dysfunction (impotence). \nErectile dysfunction is defined as inability to achieve \nor maintain a satisfactory erection during a 3-month \nperiod. Most causes are organic (neurogenic [e.g. \ndiabetes], vascular [related to endothelial dysfunction] \nor drug related [e.g. beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics]). \nThe onset is gradual and often begins with the loss of \nmorning erections in older men.\n",

In patients with decreased renal \nfunction, the dosages of many drugs that are cleared \nby the kidneys must be adjusted. The patient with CKD \nshould be well informed about the need for protein, \nphosphate, potassium, fluid or salt restriction. Patients \nwith UTIs may have had a number of courses of \nantibiotics. Contrast agents used for angiography CT \nscans and MRI scans can be nephrotoxic. Has the patient \nhad exposure to these recently? Treatment of \nhypertension should be documented. Certain drugs \nshould be used with caution. For example, NSAIDs \ncan worsen renal function or cause CKD.\nPAST HISTORY\nFind out whether there have been previous or recurrent \nUTIs or renal calculi. There may have been operations \nto remove urinary tract stones, or pelvic surgery may \nhave been performed because of urinary incontinence \nin women or prostatism in men. The patient may \nknow about the previous detection of proteinuria or \nmicroscopic haematuria at a routine examination. \nGlomerulonephritis will usually have been diagnosed \nby renal biopsy, a procedure that is often a memorable \nevent. Histories of diabetes mellitus or gout are relevant, \nas these diseases may lead to renal complications. It is \nmost important to find out about hypertension, because \nthis may not only cause renal impairment but is also \na common complication of renal disease. Similarly, a \nhistory of episodes of AKI, a history of cancer treated \nwith chemotherapy or radiotherapy, severe allergic \nreactions and exposure to nephrotoxic substances \nare all relevant. A history of childhood enuresis \n(bedwetting) beyond the age of 3 years old can be \nassociated with vesicoureteric reflux and subsequent renal \nscarring.\nRenovascular disease is more likely if there is a \nhistory of vascular disease elsewhere, such as myocardial \nischaemia or cerebrovascular disease. In elderly patients, \nspecific questions relating to ingestion of Bex or \nVincent’s powders may suggest a diagnosis of analgesic \nnephropathy. This is particularly important as these \npatients require surveillance for urothelial malignancy \nin addition to managing their renal impairment.\nT&O’C ESSENTIALS\n1.\t Patients with early renal disease are often \nasymptomatic.\n2.\t A routine urine or blood test may lead to the \nneed to take a renal history.\n3.\t Many drugs are nephrotoxic. A change of \nmedications may explain deterioration in renal \nfunction.\n4.\t Patients with chronic kidney disease are at \nincreased risk of cardiovascular and bone \ndisease.\n5.\t Chronic kidney disease can have a profound \neffect on a patient’s life. Questions about coping \nand support should be routine.\ne\t Cecil Alport, 1880–1959, a South African physician who worked in London \nand Egypt, described this syndrome in 1927 while working at St Mary’s \nHospital, London.\nSOCIAL HISTORY\nPatients with CKD may have many social problems. \nThere may be a need for access to equipment at home \nfor dialysis. Who does the patient contact if there is \na problem with home dialysis? You must ask detailed \nquestions to find out how the patient and his or her \nfamily are coping with the chronic illness and its \ncomplications. Has the patient been able to work? \nFind out how well informed the patient is about the \ntransplant, if this has been the treatment. Also find \nout what sort of support the patient has obtained from \nrelatives and friends. Can dialysis be organised at other \ncentres so that the patient can go on holidays?\nFAMILY HISTORY\nSome forms of renal disease are inherited. Polycystic \nkidney disease, for example, is an autosomal-dominant \ncondition. Ask about diabetes and hypertension in \nthe family. A family history of deafness and renal \nimpairment suggests Alport’se syndrome, a hereditary \nform of nephritis. A family history of kidney disease of \nany type is a risk factor for the development of CKD.\n",

      "text": "CHAPTER 18 \nThe genitourinary examination\nDon’t touch the patient—state first what you see, cultivate your powers of observation\nSIR WILLIAM OSLER (1849–1919)\nEXAMINATION ANATOMY\nFig. 18.1 shows an outline of the anatomy of the urinary \ntract. Fig. 18.2 shows the arterial supply of the kidneys \nas demonstrated on a CT renal angiogram and Fig. \n18.3 shows the outline of the renal collecting system. \nProblems with function can arise in any part, from \nthe arterial blood supply of the kidneys, the renal \nparenchyma, the ureters and bladder (including their \ninnervation) to the urethra.\nTHE EXAMINATION\nA set examination of the genitourinary system is not \nroutinely performed. However, if renal disease is \nsuspected or known to be present, then certain signs \nmust be sought. These are mostly the signs of chronic \nkidney disease (CKD) (uraemia) and its causes (see \nList 18.1). However, examination of the male genitalia \nor female pelvis (see Ch 40) is part of the routine general \nexamination.\nGENERAL APPEARANCE\nThe general inspection remains crucial. Look for \nhyperventilation, which may indicate an underlying \nmetabolic acidosis. Hiccupping may be present and can \nbe an ominous sign of advanced uraemia. There may \nbe the ammoniacal fish breath (uraemic fetor) of kidney \nfailure. This musty smell is not easy to describe but \nonce detected is easily remembered. Patients with CKD \ncommonly have a sallow complexion (a dirty brown \nappearance or uraemic tinge). This may be due to \nimpaired excretion of urinary pigments (urochromes) \ncombined with anaemia. The skin colour may be from \nslate grey to bronze, caused by iron deposition in dialysis \npatients who have received multiple blood transfusions, \nbut these signs are becoming less frequent with the \nuse of exogenous erythropoietin. In terminal renal \nfailure, patients become drowsy and finally sink into \na coma owing to nitrogen or toxin retention. Twitching \ndue to myoclonic jerks, and tetany and epileptic seizures \ndue to neuromuscular irritability or a low serum calcium \nlevel, occur late in renal failure. Overvigorous correction \nof acidosis (e.g. with bicarbonate infusions) may also \nprecipitate seizures and coma. There may be typical \nskin nodules related to calcium phosphate deposition.\nThe state of fluid balance should be assessed in all \npatients with renal disease. Severe fluid-volume \ndepletion can be a cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) \nand can cause precipitous decompensation in patients \nwith CKD. Conversely, volume excess can result from \nintravenous infusions of fluid used in an attempt to \ncorrect AKI and cause pulmonary oedema. Patients \nshould be weighed regularly as an objective measure \nof their fluid status.\nThe distinctive ketone-like smell of a urinary tract \ninfection (UTI) may be apparent. There may be evidence \nof urinary incontinence on the patient’s clothing.\nHANDS\nInspect the patient’s nails. Look for leuconychia. \nMuehrcke’s nailsa refer to paired white transverse lines \nnear the end of the nails; these occur in hypoalbumi­\nnaemia (e.g. nephrotic syndrome).1 A single transverse \nwhite band (Mees’ linesb; see Fig. 18.4) may occur in \narsenic poisoning, as well as in chronic kidney disease. \nHalf-and-half nails (distal nail brown or red, proximal \nnail pink or white) are also seen in CKD.\na\t RC Meuhrcke reported this sign in the British Medical Journal in 1956.\nb\t RA Mees, a Dutch physician, reported this sign in 1919. It had previously \nbeen reported (1901) in the Lancet by E Reynolds among drinkers of beer \ncontaminated by arsenic in the north of England.\n",

Lung \ninfection is also common as a result of the \nimmunosuppression present from the CKD itself or \nof treatment.\nTHE ABDOMINAL \nEXAMINATION\nAbdominal examination is performed as described on \npage 244. However, particular attention must be paid \nto the following.\nInspection\nThe presence of a Tenckhoff catheter (peritoneal dialysis \ncatheter) should be noted. It is important to look for \nnephrectomy scars (see Fig. 14.28, p 245). These are \noften more posterior than one might expect. It may \nbe necessary to roll the patient over and look in the \nregion of the loins. Renal transplant scars are usually \nfound in the right or left iliac fossae. A transplanted \nkidney may be visible as a bulge under the scar, as it \nis placed in a relatively superficial plane. Peritoneal \ndialysis results in small scars from catheter placement \nin the peritoneal cavity; these are situated on the lower \nabdomen, at or near the midline.\nThe abdomen may be distended because of large \npolycystic kidneys or ascites (as a result of the nephrotic \nsyndrome, or peritoneal dialysis fluid).\nInspect the scrotum for masses and genital oedema.\nPalpation\nParticular care is required here so that renal masses \n(see List 18.2) are not missed. Remember that an \nenlarged kidney usually bulges forwards, while \nperinephric abscesses or collections tend to bulge \nbackwards. Transplanted kidneys in the right or left \niliac fossa may be palpable as well. Tenderness over \nthe transplant can be a sign of rejection. Patients with \npolycystic kidneys may also have a polycystic liver and \nthere may be hepatomegaly as a result of hepatic cysts \n(see List 18.3). Feel for the presence of an enlarged \nbladder.2 Also palpate for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. \nIn the patient with abdominal pain, renal colic should \nbe suspected if there is renal tenderness (LR+, 3.6) or \nloin tenderness (LR+, 27.7).3\nsensorineural hearing loss and eye disease of the retina \nor cornea).\nInspect the patient’s eyes and look for signs of \nanaemia and, rarely, jaundice (retention of nitrogenous \nwastes can cause haemolysis). Band keratopathy is a \ncalcium deposition beneath the corneal epithelium \nin line with the interpalpebral fissure—it is due to \nsecondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism, or excessive \nreplacement of calcium in patients with CKD.\nA uraemic fetor may be present in the patient’s \nmouth. This is an ammoniacal, musty odour that results \nfrom the breakdown of urea to ammonia in the saliva. \nMucosal ulcers can occur as there is a decrease in saliva \nflow, and patients with CKD are prone to infection \n(e.g. thrush), owing to decreased acute inflammatory \nresponses as a result of nitrogen retention. Transplant \npatients treated with calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporin \nand tacrolimus) frequently develop gingival hyperplasia \n(thickening of the gums).\nNECK\nCarefully check the jugular venous pressure (see Fig. \n5.6, p 77) to help assess the intravascular volume status. \nAuscultate for carotid artery bruits; these provide a \n(rather unreliable) clue that there may be generalised \natherosclerotic disease (which can cause renal artery \nstenosis or complicate CKD). Look for signs of previous \njugular vein puncture due to previous vascular access \ninsertion (‘vascath’) for haemodialysis. Surgical scars \nfrom previous parathyroidectomy performed for \nmanagement of tertiary hyperparathyroidism may be \npresent.\nCHEST\nExamine the heart and lungs. In CKD there may be \ncongestive cardiac failure due to fluid retention, and \nhypertension as a result of sodium and water retention \nor excess vasoconstrictor activity, or both. Signs of \npulmonary oedema may also be present owing to \nuraemic lung disease (a type of non-cardiogenic \npulmonary oedema associated with a typical ‘bat’s wing’ \npattern on chest X-ray; see Fig. 8.5, p 152), volume \noverload or uraemic cardiomyopathy.\nPericarditis, which can be fibrinous or haemorrhagic \nin CKD, is secondary to retained metabolic toxins and \n",

Place \none hand under the renal angle and flick your fingers \nupwards while your other hand—placed anteriorly \nin the right or left upper quadrant—waits to feel the \nkidney move upwards and then float down again (see \nFig. 18.6).\nPercussion\nThis is necessary to confirm the presence of ascites by \nexamining for shifting dullness. Also percuss for an \nenlarged bladder.4 Obesity and ascites make direct \npercussion of the bladder difficult. This is an opportunity \nto attempt auscultatory percussion.2 Place the diaphragm \nof the stethoscope just above the border of the symphysis \npubis and perform direct percussion of the abdominal \nwall, starting at the subcostal margin in the middle \nADULT POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE\nIf you find polycystic kidneys, remember these \nvery important points.\n1.\t Take the blood pressure (75% of affected \npatients have hypertension).\n2.\t Examine the urine for haematuria (due to \nhaemorrhage into a cyst) and proteinuria \n(usually less than 2 g / day).\n3.\t Look for evidence of anaemia (due to CKD) \nor polycythaemia (due to high erythropoietin \nlevels). Note that the haemoglobin level is \nhigher than expected for the degree of renal \nfailure.\n4.\t Note the presence of hepatomegaly or \nsplenomegaly (due to cysts). These may cause \nconfusion when one is examining the \nabdomen.\n5.\t Tenderness on palpation may indicate an \ninfected cyst.\nNote: Subarachnoid haemorrhage occurs in 3% of patients \nwith polycystic kidney disease due to rupture of an associated \nintracranial aneurysm.

Similar information \nmay be gained from more gentle ballotting of the renal \nangle when the patient lies supine. Look also for sacral \noedema in a patient confined to bed, particularly if \nthe nephrotic syndrome or congestive cardiac failure \nis suspected. The presence of ulcerations of the toes \nsuggests atheroembolic disease.\nLEGS\nThe important signs here are oedema, purpura (p 346), \nlivedo reticularis (a red–blue reticularc pattern from \nvasculitis or atheroembolic disease), pigmentation, \nscratch marks and signs of peripheral vascular disease. \nExamination for peripheral neuropathy and myopathy \nis indicated, as in the arms. Gouty tophi or the presence \nof gouty arthropathy may very occasionally provide \nan explanation for the patient’s renal failure (although \nsecondary uric acid retention is common with CKD, \nit rarely causes clinical gout).\nline. There is a sudden increase in loudness when the \nupper border of the bladder is reached. It is even \npossible to estimate the volume of urine in the bladder \nby this method. An upper border less than 2 centimetres \nfrom the stethoscope suggests a fairly empty bladder, \nwhile an upper border more than 8 centimetres higher \ncorresponds to a urine volume of between 750 mL \nand 1 L.\nAuscultation\nThe important sign here is the presence of a renal bruit. \nRenal bruits are best heard above the umbilicus, about \n2 centimetres to the left or right of the midline. Listen \nwith the diaphragm of the stethoscope over both these \nareas. Next ask the patient to sit up, and listen in both \nflanks. The presence of a systolic and diastolic bruit is \nimportant. A diastolic component makes the bruit more \nlikely to be haemodynamically significant. Its presence \nsuggests renal artery stenosis due to fibromuscular \ndysplasia or atherosclerosis. Approximately 50% of \npatients with renal artery stenosis will have a bruit. In \na patient with hypertension that is difficult to control, \nthe presence of a systolic / diastolic abdominal bruit \nhas a positive LR for renal artery stenosis of over 40.3 \nOn the other hand, if only a soft systolic bruit is audible, \nat least half these patients do not have any significant \nrenal artery stenosis. In such cases the aorta or splenic \nartery may be the source of the sound. The absence of \nhypertension makes the diagnosis of renal artery \nstenosis less likely. The occurrence of unexplained \npulmonary oedema of sudden onset (‘flash’ pulmonary \noedema) in a patient with renal impairment and \nhypertension makes a diagnosis of renal artery stenosis \nmore likely.\nRectal and pelvic \nexamination\nHere the presence of prostatomegaly5,6 in men and a \nfrozen pelvis from cervical cancer in women is \nimportant, as this may be a cause of urinary tract \nobstruction and secondary renal failure. (For female \npelvic examination, see Ch 40, p 752.)\nTHE BACK\nStrike the patient’s vertebral column gently with the \nbase of your fist to elicit bony tenderness.

The presence of small firm testes suggests \nan endocrine disease (hypogonadism) or testicular \natrophy due to alcohol or drug ingestion.\nFeel posteriorly for the epididymis and then upwards \nfor the vas deferens and the spermatic cord. It should \nbe possible to differentiate the vas from the testis.\nA varicocele feels like a bag of worms in the scrotum. \nThe testis on the side of the varicocele often lies \nhorizontally. It is unclear whether this is a cause or \neffect of the varicocele. A left varicocele is sometimes \nfound when there is an underlying left renal tumour \nor left renal vein thrombosis. The significance of the \nrarer right varicocele is disputed.9\nDifferential diagnosis of a \nscrotal mass\nIf a mass is palpable in the scrotum, decide first whether \nit is possible to get above it. Have the patient stand up. \nIf no upper border is palpable, it must be descending \ndown the inguinal canal from the abdomen and is \ntherefore an inguinoscrotal hernia (see Fig. 18.10). If \nit is possible to get above the mass, it is necessary to \ndecide whether it is separate from or part of the testis, \nand to test for translucency. This is performed using \na transilluminoscope (a torch; see Fig. 18.11). With \nthe patient in a darkened room, a small torch is applied \nto the side of the swelling by invaginating the scrotal \nwall. A cystic mass will light up, whereas a solid mass \nremains dark.\nA mass that is part of the testis and that is solid \n(non-translucent) is likely to be a tumour or, rarely, \na syphilitic gumma. The testes may be enlarged and \nhard in men with leukaemia. A mass that is cystic \n(translucent) with the testis within it is a hydrocele \n(a collection of fluid in the tunica vaginalis of the \ntestis). A mass that appears separate from the testis and \ntransilluminates is probably a cyst of the epididymis, \nwhereas a similar mass that fails to transilluminate is \nprobably the result of chronic epididymitis. By feeling \nalong the testicular–epididymal groove it is usually \npossible to separate an epididymal mass from the testis \nitself.\nof the testis may cause the involved testis to appear \nhigher and to lie more transversely than normal. Inspect \nfor oedema of the skin, sebaceous cysts, tinea cruris \n(an erythematous rash caused by a fungal infection of \nthe moist skin of the groin) or scabies. Scrotal oedema \nis common in severe cardiac failure and may occur \nwith the nephrotic syndrome and ascites.\nPalpate each testis gently using the fingers and thumb \nof the (gloved) right hand or cradle the testis between \nthe middle and index fingers of the right hand and \npalpate it with the ipsilateral thumb.7 The testes are \nnormally equal in size, smooth and relatively firm. \nAbsence of one or both testes may be due to previous \nexcision, failure of the testis to descend or to a retractile \ntestis. In children the testes may retract as examination \nof the scrotum begins because of a marked cremasteric \nreflex. A maldescended testis (one that lies permanently \nin the inguinal canal or higher) has a high chance of \ndeveloping malignancy. An exquisitely tender, indurated \ntestis suggests orchitis.8 This is often due to mumps in \npostpubertal patients and occurs about 5 days after \nthe parotitis.

Examine the mouth for \ndryness, ulcers or fetor, and note the presence of \nany vasculitic rash on the face.\nCheck the neck for surgical scars, and listen for \ncarotid bruits. Look at the jugular venous pressure \nwith the patient at 45°.\nThe patient should then lie flat while you \nexamine the abdomen for scars indicating \nperitoneal dialysis or operations, including renal \ntransplants. Palpate for the kidneys, including \ntransplanted kidneys, and then examine the liver \nand spleen. Feel for an abdominal aortic \naneurysm. Percuss over the bladder, determine \nwhether there is ascites, and listen for renal bruits. \nRectal examination is indicated to detect \nprostatomegaly or bleeding.\nSit the patient up and palpate the back for \ntenderness and sacral oedema.\nExamine the heart for signs of pericarditis or \ncardiac failure and the lungs for pulmonary \noedema.\nLay the patient down again. Look at the legs \nfor oedema (due to the nephrotic syndrome or \ncardiac failure), bruising, pigmentation, scratch \nmarks or the presence of gout. Examine for \nperipheral neuropathy (decreased sensation, loss \nof the more distal reflexes).\nUrinalysis is performed, testing for specific \ngravity, pH, glucose, blood, protein or leucocytes. \nThe examination ends with measurement of the \nblood pressure, lying and standing (for orthostatic \nhypotension), and fundoscopy to look for \nhypertensive and diabetic changes.\nTEXT BOX 19.1 \n*Some patients with vertigo are also very uncomfortable when lying flat.\n",

Note the kidneys \nare usually both small on ultrasound in chronic \nkidney disease (CKD), but the exceptions include \ndiabetes mellitus and amyloid or polycystic \nkidneys.\n6.\tRenal biopsy—for example, to diagnose \nglomerulonephritis.\nThe urine\nThis valuable fluid must not be discarded in any patient \nin whom a renal, diabetic, gastrointestinal or other \nmajor system disease is suspected.\nColour\nLook at the colour of the urine (see Table 19.1).\nColour\nUnderlying causes\nVery pale or \ncolourless\nDilute urine (e.g. overhydration, recent \nexcessive beer consumption, diabetes \ninsipidus,* post-obstructive diuresis)\nYellow-\norange\nConcentrated urine (e.g. dehydration)\nBilirubin\nTetracycline, anthracene, sulfasalazine, \nriboflavin, rifampacin\nBrown\nBilirubin\nNitrofurantoin, phenothiazines; \nchloroquine, senna, rhubarb (yellow to \nbrown or red)\nPink\nBeetroot consumption\nPhenindione, phenolphthalein (laxatives), \nuric acid crystalluria (massive)\nRed\nHaematuria, haemoglobinuria, \nmyoglobinuria (may also be pink, \nbrown or black)\nPorphyrins, rifampicin, phenazopyridine, \nphenytoin, beetroot\nGreen\nMethylene blue, triamterene, \nmyoglobinuria when mild\nBlack\nSevere haemoglobinuria\nMethyldopa, metronidazole, unipenem\nMelanoma, ochronosis; porphyrins, \nalkaptonuria (red to black on standing)\nWhite / milky\nChyluria\n*Diabetes comes from a Greek word meaning ‘passing through’ and \nrefers to the large amount of urine passed by people with \nuncontrolled diabetes mellitus or with diabetes insipidus.

A reading of + of proteinuria may be normal, \nas up to 150 mg of protein a day is lost in the urine. \nCauses of abnormal amounts of protein in the urine \nare outlined in Lists 19.1 and 19.2. Chemical dipsticks \ndo not detect the presence of Bence Jones proteinuriaa \n(immunoglobulin light chains).\nIf proteinuria is detected on dipstick testing, this \nshould be quantified and careful urine (phase-contrast) \nmicroscopy should be carried out to look for evidence \nof active renal disease.\nGlucose and ketones\nA semiquantitative measurement of glucose and ketones \nis available. Glycosuria usually indicates diabetes \nmellitus, but can occur with other diseases (see \nList 19.3).\nKetones in the urine of patients with diabetes \nmellitus are an important indication of the presence \nof diabetic ketoacidosis (see List 19.3). The three ketone \nbodies are acetone, beta-hydroxybutyric acid and \nacetoacetic acid. Lack of glucose (starvation) or lack \nof glucose availability for the cells (diabetes mellitus) \nwhich is read off the scale on the side. The specific \ngravity can also be estimated by dipstick methods.\nWater has a specific gravity of 1, and the presence \nof solutes (especially heavy solutes such as glucose or \nan iodine contrast medium) in urine increases the \nspecific gravity. The normal range is 1.002–1.025. A \nconsistently low specific gravity suggests CKD (as there \nis failure of the kidneys to concentrate the urine) or \ndiabetes insipidus (where there is a deficiency of \nantidiuretic hormone resulting in passage of a large \nvolume of dilute urine). A high specific gravity suggests \nfluid volume depletion or diabetes mellitus with the \npresence of large amounts of glucose in the urine.\nThere is a rough correlation between the specific \ngravity of the urine and its osmolarity. For example, a \nspecific gravity of 1.002 corresponds to an osmolarity \nof 100 mOsm / kg, and a specific gravity of 1.030 \ncorresponds to 1200 mOsm / kg.\nChemical analysis\nA chemical reagent colour strip allows simultaneous \nmultiple analyses of pH, protein, glucose, ketones, \nblood, nitrite, specific gravity, the presence of leucocytes, \nbile and urobilinogen. The strip is dipped in the urine \nand colour changes are measured after a set period. \nThe colours are compared with a chart provided. It \nshould be noted that the specific gravity by dipstick is \npH dependent and insensitive to non-ionised molecules, \nand therefore correlates poorly with urine osmolality.\npH\nNormal urine is acidic, except after meals when for \na short time it becomes alkaline (the alkaline tide). \nMeasuring the pH of urine is helpful in a number of \ncritical circumstances. Sometimes the urine has to be \nmade alkaline for therapeutic purposes, such as treating \nmyoglobinuria or recurrent urinary calculi due to uric \nacid or cystine. Distal renal tubular acidosis should be \nsuspected if the early-morning urine is consistently \nalkaline and cannot be acidified. Urinary tract infections \n(UTIs) with urea-splitting organisms, such as Proteus \nmirabilis, can also cause an alkaline urine which, in \nturn, favours renal struvite stone formation.\nProtein\nThe colours are compared with a chart provided. The \nstrip tests give only a semiquantitative measure of \nurinary protein (+ to ++++) and, if positive, must be \nconfirmed by other tests. It is very important to note \nthat the dipstick is sensitive to albumin but not to other \nCAUSES OF PROTEINURIA\nPersistent proteinuria\n1.\t Renal disease\nAlmost any renal disease may cause a trace of \nproteinuria.

Usually fewer than \n6 WBCs / HPF are present, although up to 10 may be \nnormal in very concentrated urine. Tubular epithelial \ncells have a compact nucleus and are larger. Pyuria \nindicates urinary tract inflammation. Bacteria may also \nbe seen if there is infection, but bacterial contamination \nis more likely if squamous epithelial cells (which are \nlarger and have single nuclei) are prominent. Sterile \npyuria is characteristic of renal tuberculosis but may \nalso occur in acute or chronic tubulointerstitial disease. \nMultistix test strips will often test for the presence of \nWBCs.\nCasts\nCasts are cylindrical moulds formed in the lumen of \nthe renal tubules or collecting ducts (see Fig. 19.3). \nThey are signs of a damaged glomerular basement \nmembrane or damaged tubules. The size of a cast is \ndetermined by the dimension of the lumen of the \nnephron in which it forms. The presence of casts is a \nvery important abnormality and indicates renal disease.\nHyaline casts are long cylindrical structures. One \nor two RBCs or WBCs may be present in the cast. \nNormally there are fewer than 1 per LPF. They consist \nlargely of Tamm–Horsfall mucoprotein secreted by the \nrenal tubules.\nGranular casts are abnormal cylindrical granular \nstructures that arise from the tubules, usually in patients \nwith proteinuria. They consist of hyaline material \ncontaining fragments of serum proteins.\nRed cell casts are always abnormal and indicate \nprimary glomerular disease (haematuria of glomerular \norigin or vasculitis). They contain 10 to 50 red cells, \nwhich are well defined.\nWith white cell casts many WBCs adhere to or \ninside the cast. These are abnormal, indicating bacterial \npyelonephritis or less commonly glomerulonephritis, \nkidney infarction or vasculitis.\nFatty casts (i.e. the presence of fat in casts) are \nsuggestive of the nephrotic syndrome.\nElectrolyte abnormalities\nThe kidneys play an important role in maintaining \nfluid and electrolyte balance within the body.

WILLIAM HARVEY (1578–1657)\nHAEMATOLOGICAL \nDISORDERS\nThe range of haematological disorders includes the \nfollowing:\n•\t Abnormalities of red cells—for example, anaemia \n(too few red cells), polycythaemia (too many red \ncells) and haemoglobinopathies (abnormal \nhaemoglobin molecules). Small red cells \n(microcytosis) and anaemia are usually a result \nof iron deficiency. Large red cells (macrocytosis) \nand anaemia can be secondary to vitamin B12 or \nfolate deficiency (oval macrocytosis), recent \nblood loss (new red cells are large) or excessive \nalcohol consumption and liver disease of any \ncause (round macrocytosis). Chronic kidney \ndisease is usually associated with anaemia partly \nas a result of reduced erythropoietin production \nby the kidneys.\n•\t Abnormalities of platelets—for example, \nthrombocytopenia (reduced platelet numbers), \nthrombocytosis (increased platelet numbers) and \nreduced platelet function, for example as a result \nof the use of antiplatelet drugs (aspirin being the \ncommonest).\n•\t Abnormalities of clotting factors—for example, \nhaemophilia (clotting factor VIII or IX \ndeficiency) and increased tendency to clotting \n(e.g. presence of factor V Leiden mutation).\n•\t Abnormalities of white cells—for example, \nneutropenia (reduced neutrophil numbers) and \nleukaemia (increased numbers of white cells, \nmature, immature or both).\n•\t Reductions in bone marrow production of white \nor red cells, or both (e.g. myelodysplastic \nsyndrome [MDS], myelofibrosis, bone marrow \ninfiltration and drug- or immune-induced \naplasia).\n•\t Cancers of lymph nodes (Hodgkin’s lymphoma \nand non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma [NHL]).\n•\t Abnormalities of immunoglobulin-producing \ncells—for example, multiple myeloma \n(monoclonal overproduction) and \nimmunoglobulin deficiencies.\nPRESENTING SYMPTOMS\nMajor presenting symptoms are outlined in List 20.1.\nRed cell abnormalities\nThe numerous causes of anaemia make a careful history \nimportant in helping to work out the aetiology (see \nQuestions box 20.1).\nPatients with anaemia may present with weakness, \ntiredness, dyspnoea, fatigue or postural dizziness. \nAngina and heart failure may be precipitated by \nanaemia. Anaemia due to iron deficiency is often the \nresult of gastrointestinal blood loss, or sometimes \nrecurrent heavy menstrual blood loss, so these \nsymptoms should be sought. The anaemia of chronic \ndisease (red cells are normal in size—normochromic) \noccurs as a result of bone marrow suppression associated \nwith chronic illness such as rheumatoid arthritis, \ninfective endocarditis and chronic kidney disease.\nAsk about other illnesses and travel. In much of \nthe world chronic malarial infection or intestinal \nparasitic infection is the cause of chronic anaemia.\nAsk about alcohol intake, diet and possible vitamin \nB12 deficiency if the patient is known to have macrocytic \nanaemia. Some vegan diets can lead to B12 deficiency. \n",

      "text": "CHAPTER 21 \nThe haematological examination\nBlood; the red liquor that circulates in the bodies of animals.  SAMUEL JOHNSON, A dictionary of the English \nlanguage (1775)\nHaematological assessment does not depend only on \nthe microscopic examination of the blood constituents. \nPhysical signs, followed by examination of the blood \nfilm, can give vital clues about underlying disease. \nHaematological disease can affect the red blood \ncells (RBCs), the white blood cells (WBCs), the \nplatelets and other haemostatic mechanisms, as well \nas the mononuclear–phagocyte (reticuloendothelial) \nsystem.\nEXAMINATION ANATOMY\nAn important part of the examination involves \nassessment of all the palpable groups of lymph nodes. \nAs each group is examined its usual drainage area must \nbe kept in mind (see Fig. 21.1). It follows that whenever \nan abnormality is discovered anywhere that might be \ndue to infection or malignancy its draining lymph \nnodes must be examined. A decision about the size \nof the spleen is one of the most important aspects of \nthe haematological examination. The normal spleen \nlies almost completely under the ribs and is not palpable. \nAn enlarging spleen cannot displace the spine, kidney \n(it is retroperitoneal) or the diaphragm and so moves \ndownwards and displaces the stomach. Its anterior pole \nfollows a course in line with the bony part of the tenth \nrib and as it descends below the rib cage moves across \nthe abdomen towards the right iliac fossa.\nLudwig Traube described a space defined superiorly \nby the sixth rib, laterally by the midaxillary line and \ninferiorly by the left costal margin that is normally \nresonant to percussion. He noted that it became dull \nin the presence of a pleural effusion but did not realise \nthat enlargement of the spleen also caused this resonance \nto disappear (p 258).\nGENERAL APPEARANCE\nPosition the patient as for the gastrointestinal \nexamination—lying on the bed with one pillow (see \nFig. 14.2, p 230). Look for signs of wasting and for \npallor (which may be an indication of anaemia).1–3 Note \nthe patient’s racial origin (e.g. thalassaemia and sickle \ncell disease). If there is any bruising, look at its \ndistribution and extent. Jaundice may be present and \ncan indicate haemolytic anaemia. Scratch marks \n(following pruritus, which sometimes occurs with \nlymphoma and myeloproliferative disease) should be \nnoted.\nHANDS\nThe detailed examination begins in the usual way with \nassessment of the hands. Look at the nails for \nkoilonychia—these are dry, brittle, ridged, spoon-shaped \nnails, which are rarely seen today. They can be due to \nsevere iron deficiency anaemia, although the mechanism \nis unknown. Occasionally koilonychia may be due to \nfungal infection. They may also be seen in Raynaud’s \nphenomenon (see Fig. 21.2). Digital infarction (see \nFig. 21.3) may be a sign of abnormal globulins (e.g. \ncryoglobulinaemia). Pallor of the nail beds may occur \nin anaemia but is an unreliable sign. Pallor of the palmar \ncreases suggests that the haemoglobin level is less than \n70 g / L, but this is also a rather unreliable sign.1\nNote any changes of rheumatoid or gouty arthritis, \nor connective tissue disease (see Ch 25). Rheumatoid \narthritis, when associated with splenomegaly and \nneutropenia, is called Felty’s syndrome:a the mechanism \na\t Augustus Roi Felty (1895–1963), a physician at Hartford Hospital, \nConnecticut, described this in 1924.\n",

Then \nbring the patient’s arm down to rest on your forearm \nand ask him or her to relax and allow you to take the \nCHARACTERISTICS OF LYMPH NODES\nDuring palpation of lymph nodes the following \nfeatures must be considered.\nSite\nPalpable nodes may be localised to one region \n(e.g. local infection, early lymphoma) or \ngeneralised (e.g. late lymphoma).\nThe palpable lymph node areas are:\n• \nepitrochlear\n• \naxillary\n• \ncervical and occipital\n• \nsupraclavicular\n• \npara-aortic (rarely palpable)\n• \ninguinal\n• \npopliteal.\nSize\nLarge nodes are usually abnormal (greater than 1 \ncentimetre).\nConsistency\nHard nodes suggest carcinoma deposits, soft \nnodes may be normal, and rubbery nodes may \nbe due to lymphoma.\nTenderness\nThis implies infection or acute inflammation.\nFixation\nNodes that are fixed to underlying structures are \nmore likely than mobile nodes to be infiltrated \nby carcinoma.\nOverlying skin\nInflammation of the overlying skin suggests \ninfection, and tethering to the overlying skin \nsuggests carcinoma.\nLIST 21.3 \nFeeling for the epitrochlear lymph node \nFIGURE 21.6 \nFOREARMS\nIf thrombocytopenia or capillary fragility is suspected, \nthe Hessb test can be performed.c\nEPITROCHLEAR NODES\nNow feel for enlarged epitrochlear nodes. The best \nmethod is to flex the patient’s elbow to 90°, abduct \nthe upper arm a little and place the palm of your right \nhand under the patient’s right elbow (see Fig. 21.6). \nYour thumb can then be placed over the appropriate \narea, which is proximal and slightly anterior to the \nmedial epicondyle. This is repeated with the left hand \nfor the other side. An enlarged epitrochlear node is \nusually pathological. It occurs with local infection, \nnon-Hodgkin’s lymphomad or, rarely, syphilis. Note \nthe features and different causes as outlined in Lists \n21.3 and 21.4. Certain symptoms and signs suggest \nlymphadenopathy may be the result of a significant \ndisease (see Good signs guide 21.1).\nd\t Thomas Hodgkin (1798–1866), a famous student at Guy’s Hospital, London, \ndescribed his disease in 1832. The first case he described was a patient \nof Richard Bright’s. Hodgkin was one of the first to use the stethoscope \nin England. On failing to be appointed a physician, he gave up medicine \nand became a missionary.\nb\t Alfred Hess (1875–1933), a professor of paediatrics in New York, described \nthis in 1914.\nc\t This test is only of historical interest these days, as a platelet count can \nbe obtained almost as quickly in most hospitals and clinics. A blood \npressure cuff, placed over the upper arm, is inflated to a point 10 mmHg \nabove the diastolic blood pressure. Wait for 5 minutes, then deflate the \ncuff and wait for another 5 minutes before inspecting the arm. Look for \npetechiae, which are usually most prominent in the cubital fossa and \nnear the wrist, where the skin is most lax. Fewer than 5 petechiae per \ncm2 is normal, whereas more than 20 is definitely abnormal, suggesting \nthrombocytopenia, abnormal platelet function or capillary fragility.\n",

Make sure he or she is fully \nundressed, in stages and with a gown for women. \nLook for bruising, pigmentation, cyanosis, jaundice \nand scratch marks (due to myeloproliferative \ndisease or lymphoma). Also note the racial origin \nof the patient.\nPick up the patient’s hands. Look at the nails \nfor koilonychia (spoon-shaped nails, which are \nrarely seen today and indicate iron deficiency) \nand the changes of vasculitis. Pale palmar \ncreases may indicate anaemia (typically the \nhaemoglobin level has to be lower than 70 g / L). \nEvidence of arthropathy may be important (e.g. \nrheumatoid arthritis and Felty’s syndrome, \nrecurrent haemarthroses in bleeding disorders, \nsecondary gout in myeloproliferative disorders).\nExamine the epitrochlear nodes. Note any \nbruising. Remember, petechiae are pinhead \nhaemorrhages, whereas ecchymoses are larger \nbruises.\nGo to the axillae and palpate the axillary \nnodes. There are five main areas: central, lateral \n(above and lateral), pectoral (most medial), \ninfraclavicular and subscapular (most inferior).\nLook at the face. Inspect the eyes, noting \njaundice, pallor or haemorrhage of the sclerae, \nand the injected sclerae of polycythaemia. \nExamine the mouth. Look for perioral \ntelangiectasias. Note gum hypertrophy (e.g. from \nacute monocytic leukaemia or scurvy), \nulceration, infection, haemorrhage, atrophic \nglossitis (e.g. from iron deficiency, or vitamin B12 or \nfolate deficiency) and angular stomatitis. Look for \ntonsillar and adenoid enlargement (Waldeyer’s \nring).\nSit the patient up. Examine the cervical nodes \nfrom behind. There are eight groups: submental, \nsubmandibular, jugular chain, supraclavicular, \nposterior triangle, postauricular, preauricular and \noccipital. Then feel the supraclavicular area from \nthe front. Tap the spine with your fist for bony \ntenderness (caused by an enlarging marrow—\ne.g. in myeloma or carcinoma). Also gently press \nthe sternum, clavicles and shoulders for bony \ntenderness.\nLay the patient flat again. Examine the \nabdomen. Focus on the liver and spleen. Feel for \npara-aortic nodes. Do not forget to feel the testes \nin males and to perform a rectal and pelvic \nexamination (for tumour or bleeding). Spring the \nhips for pelvic tenderness. Palpate the inguinal \nnodes. There are two groups: along the inguinal \nligament and along the femoral vessels.\nExamine the legs. Note particularly leg ulcers. \nExamine the legs from a neurological aspect, for \nevidence of vitamin B12 deficiency or peripheral \nneuropathy from other causes. Remember, \nhypothyroidism can cause anaemia and \nneurological disease.\nFinally, examine the fundi, look at the \ntemperature chart and test the urine.\n",

After \ninterpretation of the automated red cell, white cell and \nplatelet indices, a properly made peripheral blood \nfilm is one of the simplest, least invasive and most \nreadily accessible forms of ‘tissue biopsy’ and can be \na very useful diagnostic tool in clinical medicine. An \nexamination of the patient’s blood film can: (1) assess \nwhether the morphology of RBCs, white blood cells \n(WBCs) and platelets is normal, (2) help characterise \nthe type of anaemia, (3) detect the presence of abnormal \ncells and provide clues about quantitative changes \nin plasma proteins (e.g. paraproteinaemia), and (4) \nhelp make the diagnosis of an underlying infection, \nmalignant infiltration of the bone marrow or primary \nproliferative haematological disorder.\nThe following pages present illustrated examples \nof some clinical problems diagnosed by examination \nof the blood film (see Figs 22.2 to 22.14).\nAnaemia\nAnaemia is a reduction in the concentration of \nhaemoglobin below 135 g / L in an adult man and \n115 g / L in an adult woman. Anaemia is not a disease \nitself but results from an underlying pathological \nprocess (see List 22.1). It can be classified according \nto the blood film. RBCs with a low mean cell volume \n(MCV) appear small (microcytic) and pale (low mean \nEXTENDING THE \nHAEMATOLOGICAL \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\nHaematology tests\nDiagnosis of haematological disease depends on the \nhistory, physical examination and thoughtful testing. \nAlthough haematology is a test-heavy specialty, the \nultimate diagnosis is still guided by the clinical setting.\nKey tests to consider include:\n•\t Complete blood count (CBC) or full blood count \n(FBC)—starts with the automated indices to \nidentify anaemia and the likely cause (which \nmust be confirmed by more specific testing), or \nto identify white cell disorders (e.g. leukaemia) \nor platelet disorders (low: thrombocytopenia, or \nhigh: thrombocytosis).\n•\t Peripheral blood smear—an extension of the \nphysical examination to identify disease (e.g. \ntarget cells in liver disease, spherocytes (round \nred blood cells [RBCs]) and polychromasia (the \npresence of large greyish-stained cells—\nreticulocytes) in immune haemolysis, burr cells \nin renal disease, teardrop cells in bone marrow \ninfiltration—see below).\n•\t Reticulocyte count—low if there are red cell \nproduction or maturation defects, or high if red \ncell survival is short and red cell production is \nincreased (as occurs with blood loss, or \nhaemolysis) and is correlated with polychromasia \n(reticulocytes are immature red cells released \nfrom the bone marrow).\n•\t Tests for excess bleeding—for example, the \nprothrombin time (international normalised \nratio [INR]) is increased with liver disease and \nvitamin K deficiency or warfarin therapy. The \nactivated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is \nprolonged in haemophilia or heparin therapy. \nFactor VIII and IX levels can be measured and \nused to predict bleeding risk and treatment \nrequirements for patients with haemophilia.\n•\t Tests for excess clotting propensity (thrombophilia) \n(such as a history of multiple deep venous \nthromboses)—for example, factor V Leiden \nmutation, antithrombin deficiency, protein C or \nS deficiency, antiphospholipid antibodies.\n",

Patients may note \na hypersensitivity to insect bites before the diagnosis \nis made.\nMyeloproliferative disease\nThis is a group of disorders of the haematopoietic \nstem cell. These include polycythaemia vera, primary \nmyelofibrosis, chronic myeloid leukaemia and \nessential thrombocythaemia. Overlapping clinical \nand pathological features occur in these disorders. \nTherefore, patients may have signs of one or more of \nthe conditions. Any of them may progress to acute \nmyeloid leukaemia.\nPolycythaemia\nThis is an elevated haemoglobin concentration and \ncan result from an increased RBC mass or a decreased \nplasma volume. Polycythaemia vera results from an \nautonomous increase in the RBC production. Patients \nwith polycythaemia often have a striking ruddy, plethoric \nappearance. To examine a patient with suspected \npolycythaemia, assess for both the manifestations of \npolycythaemia vera and other possible underlying causes \nof polycythaemia (see List 22.2).\nLook at the patient and estimate the state of \nhydration (dehydration alone can cause an elevated \nhaemoglobin due to haemoconcentration). Note \nwhether there is a Cushingoid (p 459) or virilised \n(p 475) appearance. Cyanosis may be present because \nof an underlying condition such as cyanotic congenital \nheart disease or chronic lung disease. Look for nicotine \nstaining (smoking). All these diseases can result in \nsecondary polycythaemia.\nInspect the patient’s arms for scratch marks; \npost-bathing pruritus occurs in polycythaemia vera, \npossibly owing to basophil histamine release. Take the \nblood pressure: very rarely a phaeochromocytoma will \ncause secondary polycythaemia and hypertension.\nExamine the patient’s eyes. Look for injected \nconjunctivae.

If there has been progressive change in the shape \nof the area, this is more likely to be significant.\nInstability\nJoint instability may be described by the patient as a \n‘giving way’, or occasionally ‘coming out’, of the joint \nin certain conditions. This may be due to true dislocation \n(e.g. with the shoulder or the patella) or alternatively \nto muscle weakness or a ligamentous problem.\nChange in sensation\nThis may occur as a result of nerve entrapment or \ninjury, and sometimes as a result of ischaemia.

The disease tends to be familial and females are \nmore likely to be affected. This is a benign condition. \nHowever, Raynaud’s phenomenon in patients with \nconnective tissue diseases, especially systemic sclerosis, \ncan lead to the formation of digital ulcers (see List \n23.5). It may be the first sign of this condition (see \nFig. 21.2 on p 337).\nDry eyes and mouth\nDry eyes and dry mouth are characteristic of Sjögren’s \nsyndrome (see List 23.6). This syndrome may occur \ncan present with an aching pain in the proximal \nmuscles around the shoulders and hips, associated \nwith weakness. Pain and stiffness in the shoulders \nand hips in patients over the age of 50 years may be \ndue to polymyalgia rheumatica. The acute or subacute \nonset of symptoms in multiple locations suggests \nan inflammatory process. Bone disease such as \nosteomyelitis, osteomalacia, osteoporosis or tumours can \ncause limb pain. Inflammation of tendons (tenosynovitis) \ncan produce local pain over the affected area.\nVascular disease may also produce pain in the limbs. \nAcute arterial occlusion causes severe pain of sudden \nonset, often with coolness or pallor. Chronic peripheral \nvascular disease can cause intermittent claudication \n(p 113). Venous thrombosis can also cause diffuse \naching pain in the legs associated with swelling.\nSpinal stenosis can cause pseudoclaudication—pain \non walking that, unlike the pain of peripheral arterial \ndisease, is relieved by leaning forwards, and the \nperipheral pulses are present.\nNerve entrapment and neuropathy can both cause \nlimb pain that is often associated with paraesthesias or \nweakness. The usual cause is synovial thickening or \njoint subluxation, especially for patients with rheumatoid \narthritis. The vasculitis associated with the inflammatory \narthropathies can also cause neuropathy leading to \ndiffuse peripheral neuropathy or mononeuritis multiplex.\nPatients with chronic rheumatoid arthritis often \ndevelop subluxation of the cervical spine at the \natlanto-axial joint. This is caused by erosion of the \ntransverse ligament around the posterior aspect of \nthe odontoid process (dens). The patient may describe \nshooting paraesthesias down the arms and an occipital \nheadache. Neck flexion leads to indentation of the cord \nby the dens and can cause tetraplegia or sudden death. \nThe abnormality may be obvious on lateral X-rays of \nthe cervical spine (see Fig. 26.3, p 431).\nInjury to peripheral nerves can result in vasomotor \nchanges and severe limb pain. This is called causalgia. \nEven following amputation of a limb, phantom limb \npain may develop and persist as a chronic problem.\nRaynaud’s phenomenon\nRaynaud’sc phenomenon is an abnormal response of the \nfingers and toes to cold.

WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, Richard II\nEXAMINATION ANATOMY\nRheumatoid arthritis first inflames the joint synovium. \nThickening of this may be palpable and is called pannus. \nLater, destruction of surrounding structures including \ntendons, articular cartilages and the bone itself occurs.\nJoint pain may be well localised if there is \ninflammation close to the skin, but deeper joint \nabnormalities may cause pain to be referred. The areas \nwhere joint pain is felt correspond to the innervation \nof the muscle attached to that joint—the myotome. \nFor example, the glenohumeral joint of the shoulder \nand the posterior scapular muscles are supplied from \nC5 and C6, so pain over the shoulder or scapula may \narise from any structure supplied from these nerve \nroots—including the shoulder muscles and joints but \nalso the C5 and C6 segments of the spine. The pattern \nof joint involvement may help in working out the type \nof arthritis. Remember though that more than one \ntype of arthritis may be present. Fig. 24.1a shows typical \nsynovial joints affected in rheumatoid arthritis, 24.1b \nthoracic joint involvement in spondyloarthropathies, \n24.1c the pattern of involvement in psoriatic arthritis \nand 24.1d knee joint involvement in osteoarthritis. \nThere are certain risk factors for osteoarthritis \n(see List 24.1).\nThe extra-articular structures that surround a joint \n(Fig. 24.2)—the ligaments, tendons and nerves—may \nalso be the source of joint pain. Disease of the joint \nitself tends to limit movement of the joint in all \ndirections, both active movement (moved by the patient) \nand passive movement (moved by the examiner). \nExtra-articular disease causes variable limitation of \nmovement in different directions and tends to cause \nmore limitation of active movement than of passive \nmovement.\nGeneral inspection\nThere are certain established ways of examining the \njoints and related structures1 and it is important to \nbe aware of the numerous systemic complications \nof rheumatological diseases. The actual system of \nexamination depends on the patient’s history and \nsometimes on the examiner’s noticing an abnormality \non general inspection. Formal examination of all the \njoints is rarely part of the routine physical examination, \nbut students should learn how to handle each joint \nproperly and a formal examination is an important \npart of the evaluation of patients who present with \njoint symptoms or who have an established diagnosis \nand active symptoms. Diseases of the extra-articular \nsoft tissues are particularly common.\nGeneral inspection is important for two reasons: \nfirst, it gives an indication of the patient’s functional \ndisability, which is essential in all rheumatological \nRISK FACTORS FOR OSTEOARTHRITIS\n• \nAge\n• \nFemale sex\n• \nObesity (especially knee)\n• \nGenetic factors\n• \nTrauma\n• \nManual labour (hand)\n• \nOccupational or recreational usage (e.g. \nfarmer’s hip, footballer’s knee)\n• \nRace (e.g. Caucasians—hip and hand)\nNote: lifetime risk of symptomatic OA of knee is \n27% and of hip 45%\nLIST 24.1 \n",

Inspect the skin for erythema indicating \nunderlying inflammation and suggesting active, intense \narthritis or infection, atrophy suggesting chronic \nunderlying disease, scars indicating previous operations \nsuch as tendon repairs or joint replacements, and rashes. \nFor example, psoriasis is associated with a rash and \npolyarthritis (inflammation of more than one joint). \nThe psoriatic rash consists of scaling erythematous \nassessments, and second, certain conditions can be \ndiagnosed by careful inspection. Look at the patient as \nhe or she walks into the room. Does walking appear to \nbe painful and difficult? What posture is taken? Does \nthe patient require assistance such as a stick or walking \nframe? Is there obvious deformity, and what joints does \nit involve? Note the pattern of joint involvement, which \ngives a clue about the likely underlying disease (see \nLists 23.2 and 23.4 on pp 364 and 366).\nFor a more detailed examination the patient \nshould be undressed as far as practical, usually to the \nunderclothes. Depending on the patient’s condition and \nthe parts of the body to be examined, the examination \nmay best be begun with the patient in bed, or sitting \nover the side of the bed or in a chair, or standing. The \nopportunity of watching the patient remove the clothes \nshould not be lost because arthritis can interfere with \nthis essential daily task.\nConsider the characteristic changes of osteoarthritis \n(see List 24.2).\nPRINCIPLES OF JOINT \nEXAMINATION\nCertain general rules apply to the examination of all \nthe joints and they can be summarised as: look, feel, \nmove, measure and compare with the opposite side.\nCapital (wrist)\nbones\nCarpometacarpal joint\nMetcarpophalangeal joint\nProximal phalanges\nProximal\ninterphalangeal joint\nMiddle phalanx\nSynovial cavity\nRoot of nail\nCuticle\nLunula\nNail\nDistal phalanx\nDistal phalanx\nProximal phalanx\nSecond metacarpal\nFirst\nmetacarpal\nBase\nBase\nHead\nHead\nCapsule\nPalmar \nligament\nDistal \ninterphalangeal \njoint\nDorsal digital\nartery\nThird metacarpal\nArticular cartilage\nHand bones and finger joint—a typical synovial joint \nFIGURE 24.2 \nTYPICAL FINDINGS IN OSTEOARTHRITIC \nJOINTS\n• \nOsteophytes (bony swellings) around the \njoint margins (e.g. Heberden’s nodes)\n• \nLittle or no synovitis\n• \nDeformity with little instability\n• \nReduced movement—passive and active\n• \nCrepitus on joint movement\n• \nTenderness over the joint\n• \nWasting and weakness of muscles\nLIST 24.2 \n",

This is done traditionally with \nthe backs of the fingers where temperature appreciation \nis said to be better. A cool joint is unlikely to be involved \nin an acute inflammatory process. A swollen and slightly \nwarm joint may be affected by active synovitis (see \nbelow), infection (very warm, e.g. Staphylococcus) or \ncrystal arthritis (e.g. gout).\nTenderness is a guide to the acuteness of the \ninflammation, but may be present over the muscles of \npatients with fibromyalgia. Tenderness elicited over the \nmargins of a joint indicates inflammation. Where the \njoint cannot be examined directly (e.g. hips, midtarsal \njoints), passive movement that causes pain is a surrogate \nfor this. Tell the patient to state if the examination is \nbecoming uncomfortable. Tenderness can be graded as \nfollows:\nGrade I\nPatient complains of pain\nGrade II\nPatient complains of pain and \nwinces\nGrade III\nPatient complains of pain, winces \nand withdraws the joint\nGrade IV\nPatient does not allow palpation.\nThis may result from joint inflammation or from lesions \noutside the joints (periarticular tissues), including \ninflamed tendons, bursae or attachments (entheses). \nInfected joints are extremely tender and patients will \noften not let the examiner move the joint at all. Palpation \nof a joint or area for tenderness must be performed \ngently, and the patient’s face rather than the joint itself \nshould be watched for signs that the examination is \nuncomfortable.\nPalpate the joint deliberately now, if possible, \nfor evidence of synovitis, which is a soft and spongy \n(boggy) swelling. This must be distinguished from an \neffusion, which tends to affect large joints but can occur \nin any joint. Here the swelling is fluctuant and can be \nmade to shift within the joint. Bony swelling feels hard \nand immobile, and suggests osteophyte formation or \nsubchondral bone thickening.\nMove\nMuch information about certain joints is gained by \ntesting the range of passive movement. (Passive \nmovement is obviously contraindicated in cases of \nrecent injury to the limb or joint, such as a suspected \nfracture.) Ask the patient to relax and let you move \nplaques on extensor surfaces. The nails are often also \naffected (see Fig. 24.6). Also look for a vasculitic skin \nrash (inflammation of the blood vessels of the skin), \nwhich can range in appearance from palpable purpura \nor livedo reticularis (bluish-purple streaks in a net-like \npattern) to skin necrosis.\nA small, firm, painless swelling over the back (dorsal \nsurface) of the wrist is usually a synovial cyst—a \nganglion.a A larger, localised, soft area of swelling of \nthe dorsum of the wrist generally indicates tenosynovitis.\nNote any swelling over the joint. There are a number \nof possible causes; these include effusion into the joint \nspace, hypertrophy and inflammation of the synovium \n(e.g. rheumatoid arthritis), or bony overgrowths at the \njoint margins (e.g. osteoarthritis). It may also occur \nwhen tissues around the joints become involved, as \nwith the tendinitis or bursitis of rheumatoid arthritis. \nSwelling of the lower legs may be due to fluid retention, \nwhich is painless and can occur in association with \ninflammation anywhere in the leg. Painful swelling \nmay result from inflammation of the ankle joints or \ntendons, or of the fascia, or from inflammatory oedema \nof the skin and subcutaneous tissue.\nDeformity is the sign of a chronic, usually destructive, \narthritis and ranges from mild ulnar deviation of the \nmetacarpophalangeal joints in early rheumatoid arthritis \nto the gross destruction and disorganisation of a \ndenervated (Charcot’sb) joint (see Fig. 29.4 on p 466). \nDeviation of the part of the body away from the midline \nis called valgus deformity, and that towards the midline \nit is called varus deformity. For example, genu valgum \nmeans knock-kneed and genu varum means bow-legged.\nLook for abnormal bone alignment. Subluxation is \nsaid to be present when displaced parts of the joint \nsurfaces remain partly in contact. Dislocation is used \nto describe displacement where there is loss of contact \nbetween the joint surfaces.\nMuscle wasting results from a combination of disuse \nof the joint, inflammation of the surrounding tissues \nand sometimes nerve entrapment. It tends to affect \nmuscle groups adjacent to the diseased joint (e.g. \nquadriceps wasting with active arthritis of the knee) \nand is a sign of chronicity.\na\t The traditional treatment, striking the lesion very hard with the family \nBible, is not effective.\nb\t Jean Martin Charcot (1825–1893), a Parisian physician and neurologist. \nHe became professor of nervous diseases, holding the first Chair of \nNeurology in the world.

It is \nmore likely to be vague or diffuse if it has radiated \nfrom the shoulder or neck or is due to carpal tunnel \nsyndrome, and to be localised if it is due to arthritis. \nStiffness is typically worse in the mornings in rheumatoid \narthritis. Swelling of the wrist may indicate arthritis or \ntendon sheath inflammation. Swelling of individual \njoints suggests arthritis. Deformity of the fingers and \nhand due to rheumatoid arthritis or of the fingers as \na result of arthritis or gouty tophi may be the presenting \ncomplaint. The sudden onset of deformity suggests \ntendon rupture. Locking or snapping of a finger (trigger \nfinger) is typical of inflammation of a flexor tendon \nsheath (tenovaginitis). Loss of function is a serious \nproblem when it involves the numerous functions of \nthe hand and wrist. Ask what problems this has caused. \nNeurological symptoms as a result of nerve compression \nmay cause paraesthesias, numbness or sometimes \nhyperaesthesia or limitation of strength or of complicated \nhand functions.\nExamination\nFirst sit the patient over the side of the bed and place \nthe patient’s hands on the pillow with palms down. \nOften examination (Text box 24.1) or even inspection \nof the hands alone will give enough information for \nthe examiner to make a diagnosis. As a result this is \nquite a popular test in the OSCE.\nthe intrinsic muscles of the hand. This results in the \nappearance of hollow ridges between the metacarpal \nbones. It is especially obvious on the dorsum of \nthe hand.\nGo on to the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints. \nAgain note any skin abnormalities, swelling or defor­\nmity. Look especially for ulnar deviation and volar \n(palmar) subluxation of the fingers. Ulnar deviation is \ndeviation of the phalanges at the metacarpophalangeal \njoints towards the medial (ulnar) side of the hand. It \nis usually associated with anterior (Volar) subluxation \nof the fingers (see Fig. 24.4). These deformities are \ncharacteristic but not pathognomonic of rheumatoid \narthritis (see List 24.3).\nNext inspect the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) \nand distal interphalangeal joints. Again note any skin \nchanges and joint swelling. Look for the characteristic \ndeformities of rheumatoid arthritis (see Fig. 24.4). \nThese include swan neck and boutonnière deformity \nof the fingers and Z deformity of the thumb. They are \ndue to joint destruction and tendon dysfunction. The \nswan neck deformity is hyperextension at the proximal \ninterphalangeal joint and fixed flexion deformity at the \ndistal interphalangeal joint. It is due to subluxation at the \nproximal interphalangeal joint and tendon shortening \nat the distal interphalangeal joint. The boutonnière \n(buttonhole) deformity consists of fixed flexion of the \nproximal interphalangeal joint and extension of the \ndistal interphalangeal joints. This is due to protrusion of \nthe proximal interphalangeal joint through its ruptured \nextensor tendon.

Rheumatoid \narthritis is an important cause. Typically, flexion of \nthe finger occurs freely up to a certain point where it \nsticks and cannot be extended (as flexors are more \npowerful than extensors). The application of greater \nforce overcomes the resistance with a snap.\nIf the carpal tunnel syndrome is suspected, ask the \npatient to flex both wrists for 30 seconds—paraesthesias \nwill often be precipitated in the affected hand if the \nsyndrome is present (Phalen’sf wrist flexion test). The \nparaesthesias (pins and needles) are in the distribution \nof the median nerve (p 559), when thickening of the \nflexor retinaculum has entrapped the nerve in the carpal \ntunnel (see List 24.4). This test is more reliable than \nTinel’sg sign, in which tapping over the flexor retinaculum \n(which lies at the proximal part of the palm) may cause \nsimilar paraesthesias.2\nNow test active movements. First assess wrist flexion \nand extension as shown in Fig. 24.11. Compare the two \nsides. Now go on to thumb movements (see Fig. 24.12). \nThe patient holds the hand flat, palm upwards, and your \nhand holds the patient’s fingers. Test extension by asking \nthe patient to stretch the thumb outwards; abduction by \nasking for the thumb to be pointed straight upwards; \nadduction by asking the patient to squeeze your finger \nand opposition by getting the patient to touch the little \nfinger with the thumb. Look for limitation of these \nmovements and discomfort caused by them. Next test \nmetacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal movements. \nAs a screening test, ask the patient to make a fist then \nto straighten out the fingers (see Fig. 24.13). Then test \nthe fingers individually. If active flexion of one or more \nfingers is reduced, test the superficial and profundus \nflexor tendons (see Fig. 24.14). Hold the proximal \nfinger joint extended and instruct the patient to bend \nthe tip of the finger; the distal fingertip will only flex \nif the flexor profundus is intact. Then hold the other \nfingers extended (to inactivate the profundus) with \nthe finger to be tested resting above your fingers and \ninstruct the patient to bend the whole finger (inability \nindicates the superficialis is unable to work).

The upper arms \nshould be exposed completely. Note any deformity or \ndifference in the normal 5–10° valgus position (carrying \nanglei) as the patient stands with the palms facing \nforwards.\nLook for a joint effusion, which appears as a swelling \non either side of the olecranon. Discrete swellings over \nthe olecranon or over the proximal subcutaneous border \nof the ulna may be due to rheumatoid nodules, gouty \ntophi, an enlarged olecranon bursa or, rarely, to other \ntypes of nodules (see List 24.5).\nFeel for tenderness, particularly over the lateral \nand medial epicondyles, which may indicate tennis \nand golfer’s elbow respectively. Palpate any discrete \nswellings. Rheumatoid nodules are quite hard, may \nbe tender and are attached to underlying structures. \nGouty tophi have a firm feeling and often appear yellow \nunder the skin, but are sometimes difficult to distinguish \nfrom rheumatoid nodules. A fluid collection in the \nolecranon bursa is softly fluctuant and may be tender if \ninflammation is present. These collections are associated \nwith rheumatoid arthritis and gout, but often occur \nindependently of these diseases.\nSmall amounts of fluid or synovitis of the elbow joint \nmay be detected by the examiner, facing the patient, \nplacing the thumb of the opposite hand along the edge \nof the ulnar shaft just distal to the olecranon where \nthe synovium is closest to the surface.

It \ninvolves three bones: the clavicle, the scapula and the \nhumerus (see Fig. 24.19). The acromioclavicular joint is \nformed by the acromion of the scapula and the clavicle. \nMovements of the shoulder are a result of a combination \nof ball-and-socket articulation at the glenohumeral \njoint (between the glenoid cavity [fossa] of the scapula \nand the ball-shaped end of the humerus) and motion \nbetween the scapula and the thorax. Seventeen muscles \nare involved. Stability of the joint itself depends on four \nmuscles: supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and \nsubscapularis—the rotator cuff muscles. The shallow \nglenoid fossa is extended by a cartilage rim (the glenoid \nlabrum). This cushions the humeral head and increases \nthe depth and surface area of articulation. Instability \nof the joint can result from abnormality of, or injury \nto, any of these structures.\nThe joint is encased in a capsule and is lined with \nsynovium.\nThis complicated joint is frequently affected by a \nnumber of non-arthritic conditions involving its bursa, \ncapsule and surrounding tendons—for example, ‘frozen \n(stiff) shoulder’ (adhesive capsulitis), tendinitis and \nbursitis. All of these disorders affect movement of the \nshoulder.\nInstability of the joint can result in dislocation \n(all contact between the articular surfaces is lost) \nor subluxation (partial contact remains). Anterior \ndislocation or subluxation tends to occur after a fall \nonto an outstretched arm. More chronic instability is \nassociated with gradual stretching of the supporting \nstructures by sporting or work activities that involve use \nof the arm above the head. Patients with ligamentous \nlaxity may have multidirectional instability and some \nare able to dislocate their shoulders voluntarily (e.g. \nat parties).\nHistory\nPain is the most common symptom of a patient with \nshoulder problems.3 Typically it is felt over the front \nand lateral part of the joint. It may radiate to the \ninsertion of the deltoid or even further. Pain felt over \nthe top of the shoulder is more likely to come from the \nacromioclavicular joint or from the neck. Deformity has \nto be severe before it becomes obvious. Pain and stiffness \nmay severely limit shoulder movement. Instability may \n",

The patient \nwill strongly resist this manoeuvre if there is impending \ndislocation (LR+ 1.8; LR− 0.23). There will be a similar \nresponse if the arm is adducted and internally rotated \nand posterior dislocation is about to occur. The clunk \ntest is probably kinder to the patient and more accurate. \nThe patient lies supine with the arm fully abducted. \nIt is then put into full external rotation and the head \nof the humerus is pushed a little anteriorly. Rather \nthan looking for signs of distress, the examiner listens \nand feels for a grinding sensation from the shoulder \n(LR+ 16; LR− 0.67).\nThis is also the time to test biceps function. The \npatient flexes the elbow against resistance. A ruptured \nbiceps tendon causes the biceps muscle to roll up into \na ball.\nAs a general rule, intra-articular disease produces \npainful limitation of movement in all directions, whereas \ntendinitis produces painful limitation of movement in \none plane only and tendon rupture or neurological \nlesions produce painless weakness. For example, if \nthe abnormal sign is limited shoulder abduction in \nthe middle range (45–135°), this suggests rotator \ncuff problems (i.e. the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, \nsubscapularis and teres minor muscles) rather than \narthritis.\nThe drop-arm test can help diagnose a supraspinatus \ntear. Abduct the patient’s arm to 90° and ask him or \nher to let the arm down slowly to the waist. A positive \ntest (the arm drops suddenly) indicates a supra­\nspinatus tear.\nBicipital tendinitis causes localised tenderness \nover the groove. The supraspinatus tendon is a little \nhigher, just under the anterior surface of the acromion. \nSupraspinatus tendinitis is common. Testing for it \ninvolves placing a finger over the head of the tendon \nwhile the shoulder is in extension. As this pushes the \ntendon forwards against your finger, the movement is \npainful. When the shoulder is then flexed the tendon \nmoves away and the pain disappears.\nDo not forget that arthritis affecting the acromi­\noclavicular joint can be confused with glenohumeral \ndisorders. The cross-arm test can help. Ask the patient \nto abduct the arm to 90° and then adduct the arm \nacross the body. The test is positive if pain is felt in \nthe acromioclavicular joint region.\nDeltoid wasting is characteristic of shoulder problems, \nwhereas trapezius muscle wasting suggests cervical \nspine problems.\nLook at the joint. A swelling may be visible anteriorly, \nbut unless effusions are large and the patient is thin \nthese are difficult to detect. Look for asymmetry and \nfor scars as a result of injury or previous surgery.\nFeel for tenderness and swelling. Stand beside the \npatient, rest one hand on the patient’s shoulder and \nmove the arm into different positions (see below). As \nthe shoulder moves, feel the acromioclavicular joint \nand then move your hand along the clavicle to the \nsternoclavicular joint.\nMove the joint (see Figs 24.20 and 24.21). The zero \nposition is with the arm hanging by the side of the \nbody so that the palm faces forwards. Abduction tests \nglenohumeral abduction, which is normally possible \nto 90°. For the right shoulder, stand behind the patient \nresting your left hand on the patient’s shoulder, while \nyour right hand abducts the elbow from the shoulder. \nElevation is usually possible to 180° when it is performed \nactively, as movement of the scapula is then included. \nAdduction is possible to 50°; the arm is carried forwards \nacross the front of the chest. External rotation is possible \nto 65°; with the elbow bent to 90° the arm is turned \nlaterally as far as possible. Internal rotation is usually \npossible to 90°; it is tested actively by asking the patient \nto place his or her hand behind the back and then to try \nto scratch the back as high up as possible with the thumb. \nPatients with rotator cuff problems complain of pain \nwhen they perform this manoeuvre. Flexion is possible \nto 180°, of which the glenohumeral joint contributes \nabout 90°. Extension is possible to 65°; the arm is swung \nbackwards as in marching. During all these manoeuvres, \nlimitation with or without pain and joint crepitus are \nassessed.\nRapid assessment of shoulder movement is possible \nusing the three-step Apleyj scratch test (see Fig. 24.22). \nStand behind and ask the patient to scratch an imaginary \nitch over the opposite scapula, first by reaching over \nthe opposite shoulder, next by reaching behind the \nneck and finally by reaching behind the back. If this \ntest is normal there is usually no need to test passive \nshoulder movements.\nThe anterior stability of the shoulder joint is \ntraditionally assessed by the apprehension test; stand \nj\t\nAlan Apley, an orthopaedic surgeon at St Thomas’s Hospital, London.\n",

The discomfort is usually worst in the lumbosacral \narea. Ask whether the onset was sudden and associated \nwith lifting or straining or whether it was gradual.6,7 \nStiffness and pain in the lower back that is worse \nin the morning is characteristic of an inflammatory \nspondyloarthritis. Pain that shoots from the buttock \nand thigh along the sciatic nerve distribution is called \nsciatica. In sciatic nerve compression at a lumbosacral \nnerve root, the pain is often aggravated by coughing or \nstraining or when the patient leans forwards slightly, \nfor example to brush the teeth. The back pain that \npatients may call ‘lumbago’ is often due to referred \npain (e.g. from the vertebral joints). There may be \nother neurological symptoms in the legs due to nerve \ncompression or irritation. The distribution of the \nparaesthesias or weakness may indicate the level of \nspinal cord or nerve root abnormality. Ask about \nurinary incontinence and retention as well as numbness \nExamining the spinous processes \nFIGURE 24.27 \nin the ‘saddle region’, erectile dysfunction and bowel \nincontinence, which can be a result of cauda equina \ninvolvement.\nExamination\nTo start the examination, have the patient standing \nand clothed only in underpants. Look for deformity, \ninspecting from both the back and the side. Note \nespecially loss of the normal thoracic kyphosis and \nlumbar lordosis, which is typical of ankylosing \nspondylitis. Also note any evidence of scoliosis, a lateral \ncurvature of the spine that may be simple (‘C’ shaped) \nor compound (‘S’ shaped) and that can result from \ntrauma, developmental abnormalities, vertebral body \ndisease (e.g. rickets, tuberculosis) or muscle abnormality \n(e.g. polio).\nFeel each vertebral body for tenderness and palpate \nfor muscle spasm.6\nMovement is assessed actively. Bending movements \nlargely take place at the lumbar spine, whereas rotational \nmovements occur at the thoracic spine. Range of \nmovement is tested by observation (see Fig. 24.28) \nand the use of Schober’s test (see below and Fig. 24.29).\nFlexion is tested by asking the patient to touch \nthe toes with the knees straight. The normal range of \nflexion is very wide. Many people can reach only halfway \ndown the shins when the knees are kept straight. As \nthe patient bends, look at the spine: there is normally \na gentle curve along the back from the shoulders to the \npelvis. Patients with advanced ankylosing spondylitis \nhave a flat ankylosed spine and all the bending occurs \nat the hips. Test extension by asking the patient to lean \nbackwards. Patients with back pain usually find this \nless uncomfortable than bending forwards. Lateral \nbending is assessed by getting the patient to slide \nthe right hand down the right leg as far as possible \nwithout bending forwards, and then the same for the \nleft side. This movement tends to be restricted early \nin ankylosing spondylitis. Rotation is tested with the \npatient sitting on a stool (to fix the pelvis) and asking \nhim or her to rotate the head and shoulders as far as \npossible to each side. This is best viewed from above. \nIt can also be tested while the patient is lying (see \nFig. 24.28d).\nMeasure the lumbar flexion with Schober’s test (see \nFig. 24.29).

Surrounding tendons and nerves may cause \nsymptoms that need to be distinguished from hip \nabnormalities.\nHistory\nThe word ‘hip’ is used variably by patients to indicate \na number of sites including the buttocks, low back or \ntrochanteric region. Ask the patient to point to the site \nof pain (see List 24.7). The patient with true hip joint \nproblems will often have pain that is felt anteriorly in \nthe groin or may radiate to the knee. Athletes with \n‘groin strain’ often have adductor tendinitis or osteitis \npubis caused by trauma or overuse. Pain over the greater \ntrochanter is more often a result of trochanteric bursitis, \ngluteus medius tendinitis or tear. It is exacerbated by \ncrossing the legs. Find out what sport the patient plays. \nThe condition is common in sports involving running. \nTypically the pain is present at the start of exercise and \nimproves as the athlete ‘warms up’, only to recur later at \nrest. Take a detailed work history. Overuse syndromes \nrelated to work may be worst on Fridays and improve \nover the weekend. Jumping down off of trucks or \nplatforms may cause repeated trauma to the joint.\nA limp may be noticed by the patient.

      "text": "400\t\nSECTION 7  The rheumatological system\nmore often cause diffuse pain. Ask the patient to point \nto the place where the pain is most severe. Stiffness is \nusually of gradual onset and is typical of osteoarthritis. \nIt tends to be worse after inactivity. Locking of the \nknee usually means there is a sudden inability to \nreach full extension. The knee is often stuck at about \n45° of flexion. Unlocking may occur just as suddenly, \nsometimes following some form of manipulation by the \npatient. The cause is mechanical: a loose body or torn \nmeniscus has become wedged between the articular \nsurfaces of the joint. Swelling that occurs suddenly \nafter an injury is often due to a haemarthrosis from a \nfracture or ligamentous tear; if swelling occurs after \na few hours, a torn meniscus is more likely to be the \ncause. Arthritis and synovitis cause a chronic swelling. \nPatients sometimes notice deformity, which in later \nlife is usually due to arthritis. Sometimes the patient \nmay complain that the knee is unstable or gives way. \nPatellar instability and ruptured ligaments may present \nthis way. Always ask about loss of function. There is \noften a reduced ability to walk distances, climb stairs \nand get into and out of chairs.\nOsteoarthritis of the knee is very common. \nOlder age, previous injury and stiffness lasting less \nthan half an hour are in favour of this diagnosis as \nthe cause of knee pain. Physically active adolescents \nmay present with pain and swelling below the knee \nat the point of attachment of the patellar tendon to \nthe tibial tuberosity—tibial apophysitis or Osgood–\nSchlatter’sq disease. This is the most common traction \napophysitis.\nAsk whether there has been previous knee surgery \nor arthroscopy.\nTake an occupational and sporting history. Injury \nand overuse syndromes are often related to exercise \n(particularly competitive sport) and occupations \nassociated with repetitive minor injuries to the knees.\nExamination\nThis is performed with the patient in a number of \npositions and, of course, walking.11,12 Even more than \nwith the other joints, it is important to examine the \nmore normal or uninjured knee first. This will help \nwith the interpretation of changes in the other knee and \ngive the patient more confidence that the examination \nwill not be painful.\nLook first with the patient lying down on the back \nwith both knees and thighs fully exposed. The affected \nknee will often be flexed, the most comfortable position. \nNote any quadriceps wasting. This begins quite soon \nafter knee abnormalities lead to disuse of the muscle. \nExamine the knees themselves for skin changes, scars \n(including those from previous surgery or arthroscopy), \nswelling and deformity. Compare one side with the \nother. Localised swellings may move about as the knee \nflexes and extends. They are often cartilaginous loose \nbodies. Fixed lumps in the line of the joint may be \nmeniscal cysts.\nSwelling of the synovium or a knee effusion is usually \nseen medial to the patella and in the joint’s suprapatellar \nextension. Loss of the peripatellar grooves may be an \nearly sign of an effusion. Assess fixed flexion deformity \nby squatting down and looking at each knee from the \nside. A space under the knee will be visible if there is \npermanent flexion deformity arthritis.\nVarus and valgus deformity may be obvious here \nbut are more easily seen when the patient stands. Varus \ndeformity is often related to osteoarthritis and valgus \ndeformity to rheumatoid arthritis.\nNow watch as the patient flexes and straightens \neach knee in turn. As the knee extends the patella \nglides upwards and remains centred over the femoral \ncondyles. If there is patellar subluxation it will slip \nlaterally during knee flexion and return to the midline \nduring knee extension.\nFeel the quadriceps for wasting. Palpate over the \nknees for warmth and synovial swelling.\nTest carefully for a joint effusion. The patellar tap \nis used to confirm the presence of large effusions (see \nFig. 24.33a). Rest one hand over the lower part of the \nquadriceps muscle and compress the suprapatellar \nextension of the joint space. With your other hand \npush the patella downwards. The sign is positive if the \npatella is felt to sink and then comes to rest with a tap \nas it touches the underlying femur. The bulge sign is \nused to detect small effusions (see Fig. 24.33b). Use \nyour left hand to compress the suprapatellar pouch \nwhile you run the fingers of your right hand along the \ngroove beside the patella on one side and then on the \nother.

Study the gait and the movement of \nthe knees; particularly look for a sideways wobble.\nAnkles and feet\nExamination anatomy\nThe ankle is a synovial hinge joint formed between the \ndistal ends of the tibia and the fibula, and the talus \nbone (see Fig. 24.38). Protrusions from the ends of the \ntibia and the fibula, which are called malleoli, form a \nsocket that in combination with lateral ligaments \nstabilises the joint. The proximal part of the foot is \ncalled the tarsus and contains the seven tarsal bones \n(talus, calcaneus [heel], navicular, cuboid and the three \ncuneiform bones) with their supporting ligaments and \njoint capsules. The joints and ligaments around these \nbones allow the movements of the foot: inversion and \neversion, dorsi- (upward) and plantar (downward) \nflexion.\nHistory\nThe usual symptom is pain. If this is present only when \nthe patient wears shoes, the shoes rather than the feet \nmay be the problem. There may be a specific area that is \npainful and the patient should be asked to point to this. \nThere may be a history of injury or of intensive or unusual \nexercise. Ankle injuries are common in certain sports \nthat involve twisting of the foot on the leg (e.g. netball, \nfootball; see List 24.8). Rupture of the Achilles tendon \noccurs in squash and tennis players over 50 years of \nage and following forced dorsiflexion of the foot. Heel \npain (both plantar and retrocalcaneal) is often due to \nplantar fasciitis, Achilles tendinitis or retrocalcaneal \nbursitis.\nPatients with foot pain (see List 24.9) or ankle pain \nmay have a history of rheumatoid arthritis. This can \ncause pain and deformity and affect the ankle subtalar, \nmidtarsal and metatarsophalangeal joints.\nVery severe pain involving the first metatar­\nsophalangeal joint is usually due to gout. Pain right \nover one of the metatarsals that comes on after unusually \nvigorous exercise may be due to a stress fracture.\nThere may be deformity involving the ankle or toes. \nPatients find this especially troublesome if it makes it \ndifficult to put on shoes. The patient may have noticed \nthe ligaments. If the patient finds the test painful, a \nligamentous abnormality may be the cause.\nMcMurray’ss test (see Fig. 24.37) is another way of \ndetecting a meniscal tear. With the patient lying on \nthe back, stand on the side to be tested and hold the \npatient’s ankle. Place your other hand on the medial side \nof the knee and push to apply valgus force. Extend the \npatient’s leg from the flexed position while internally \nand then externally rotating it. The test is positive if \nthere is a popping sensation, which may be followed \nby inability to extend the knee.\nApley’s grinding test (push hard) \nFIGURE 24.36 \nMcMurray’s test of the knee \nFIGURE 24.37 \ns\t\nThomas McMurray (1888–1949), the first professor of orthopaedic surgery \nin Liverpool.\n",

SIR WILLIAM OSLER (1849–1919)\nRHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS\nRheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic inflammatory \ndisease of unknown aetiology that characteristically \ninvolves the joints (see Fig. 25.1). In the majority \nof cases, patients with rheumatoid arthritis have \nrheumatoid factor present in the serum (seropositive \ndisease). These are heterogeneous antibodies directed \nagainst the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G (IgG), but \nare not specific for rheumatoid arthritis. Anti-cyclic \ncitrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies occur in 70% \nof rheumatoid arthritis (mostly the rheumatoid-factor-\npositive group), and are associated with more aggressive \ndisease and extra-articular manifestations (especially \npulmonary and cardiovascular).\nTo examine the patient with suspected rheumatoid \narthritis (see Text box 25.1 and Fig. 25.1), sit him or \nher up in bed or on a chair.\nGeneral inspection\nLook to see whether the patient has a Cushingoid \nappearance due to steroid treatment (p 458), or \nwhether there are signs of weight loss that may indicate \nactive disease.\nHands\nPut the patient’s hands on a pillow. Look especially \nfor symmetrical small joint synovitis (the distal \ninterphalangeal joints are usually spared). The other \nabnormalities in advanced disease are ulnar deviation, \nvolar subluxation of the metacarpophalangeal joints, Z \ndeformity of the thumb with swan necka and boutonnière \ndeformity of the fingers (p 375). Examine the fingernails \nand periungual areas for splinter-like vasculitic changes \nand look for wasting of the small muscles of the hand. \nLook at the palms for palmar erythema. Feel the palms \nfor palmar tendon crepitus while the patient extends \nand flexes the fingers. Look for signs of an ulnar nerve \npalsy (from ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow) and \na median nerve palsy (carpal tunnel).\nWrists\nLook for synovial thickening and perform Phalen’s sign \n(carpal tunnel).\nElbows\nLook around the elbows for rheumatoid nodules, which \nsuggest seropositive disease, and examine the elbow \njoint. Flexion contractures are common.\nShoulders and axillae\nExamine for tenderness and limitation of movement. \nAlso palpate the axillary nodes because enlarged nodes \nmay indicate active disease of joints in the area that \nthey drain.\nEyes\nLook at the eyes for redness, which may indicate \nthe dryness of Sjögren’s syndrome (see List 23.6 on \np 368), which occurs in 10%–15% of cases. Note also \nnodular scleritis—an elevated white or purple-red \nlesion, which is pathologically a rheumatoid nodule \nand usually appears surrounded by the intense redness \nof the injected sclera (see Fig. 25.2). These nodules \noccur especially in the superior parts of the sclera and \na\t The appearance resembles a swan dipping its head into the water.\n",

There are certain risk \nfactors for osteoarthritis (see List 24.1 on p 370).\nPatients typically give a history of pain and stiffness \nin the affected joint.

Pain is often intermittent \nbut patients usually report a decline in function of the \njoint over time.

While taking the history note any \nabnormal mental state—psychosis may occur due to \nthe lupus itself or to steroid therapy.\nHands\nNote any vasculitic-appearing lesions around the nail \nbed, or telangiectasia and erythema of the skin of \nthe nail base. A rash may occur—photosensitivity is \ncommon. The hand rash of lupus tends to occur over \nthe phalanges, as opposed to that of dermatomyositis, \nwhich affects the knuckles.\nRaynaud’s phenomenon may occur if the weather \nis cold (see List 23.5 on p 367).\nExamine for arthritis: synovitis of the proximal and \nmetacarpophalangeal joints. The arthritis of SLE is not \nerosive, but if severe may lead to reducible deformities \ndue to damage to supporting structures.\nForearms\nLivedo reticularis may occur here (see Fig. 25.10); in \nLatin this describes skin discoloration in the form of \na small net. This is formed by connected bluish-purple \nstreaks without discrete borders. They occur usually \non the limbs. Livedo can occur in vasculitis and in the \nantiphospholipid syndromef or from atheroembolism.1 \nLook also for purpura (due to vasculitis2 or autoimmune \nthrombocytopenia). Examine for a proximal myopathy \n(due to the disease itself or to steroid treatment). \nSubcutaneous nodules very rarely occur in SLE. The \naxillary nodes may be enlarged but will not be tender. \n(See also Ch 43, p 802.)\nHead and neck\nAlopecia (hair loss) is an important diagnostic clue \nthat occurs in about two-thirds of patients and may \nbe associated with scarring. Look especially for lupus \nhairs, which are short, broken hairs above the forehead. \nThere may be alopecia areata: circular lesions the size \nof a 20 cent coin with hair loss. Hair typically grows \nback. The hair as a whole may be coarse and dry, as \nin hypothyroidism.\nExamine the eyes for scleritis and episcleritis (more \ncommon as a manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis \nthan SLE). The eyes may be red and dry (Sjögren’s \nsyndrome). Pallor of the conjunctivae occurs with \nanaemia, usually due to chronic disease. Occasionally, \njaundice due to autoimmune haemolytic anaemia may \nbe found. Perform a fundoscopy for cytoid bodies, \nwhich are hard exudates (white spots) due to aggregates \nof swollen nerve fibres and are secondary to vasculitis.\nA facial rash may be diagnostic (see Fig. 25.11). \nThe classical rash is an erythematous ‘butterfly rash’ \nover the cheeks and bridge of the nose and must be \ndistinguished from rosacea. Mouth ulcers on the soft \nor hard palate may occur and the mouth may be dry \n(Sjögren’s syndrome).\nThe rash of discoid lupus may be found in the same \narea or affect different parts of the body.

Here \nit is subject to compression in patients who are obese, \nwear tight or heavy belts or spend long periods sitting. \nDiabetes, pregnancy and trauma can also be causes of \nproblems with the nerve.\nTarsal tunnel syndrome\nThis may be caused by compression of the posterior \ntibial nerve in its fibro-osseous canal formed by the \nflexor retinaculum and the tarsal bones. Symptoms \ninclude burning pain and paraesthesiae in the toe, \nsole and heel. Patients are often woken with pain at \nnight and, as with the carpal tunnel syndrome, this \nmay radiate upwards. Walking may improve the \nsymptoms. Causes include diabetes, synovitis from \nrheumatoid arthritis, bony deformity and flexor \ntenosynovitis. Hypertrophy of the abductor hallucis \nmuscle, which occurs in intemperate runners, is an \noccasional cause.\nExamination\nThere is usually tenderness over the nerve posterior to \nthe medial malleolus. There may be a positive Tinel’s \nsign over the tarsal tunnel. Motor findings include \nweakness of toe flexion and of the intrinsic muscles \nof the foot.\nMorton’s ‘neuroma’\nThis is caused by compression of one or more of the \ninterdigital plantar nerves by the transverse metatarsal \nligament.

It can occur in normal feet after \nprolonged standing but also occurs in a number of other \nfoot conditions (see List 25.2), and is often associated \nwith poor-fitting shoes. Morton’s metatarsalgia is \ninterdigital nerve entrapment (usually between the \nthird and fourth metatarsal bones). Patients describe \nburning pain between the metatarsal bones and may \nhave numbness on the adjacent toes. They get relief by \nremoving their shoes and massaging their foot.\nwith pain, paraesthesiae and numbness in a particular \nnerve distribution.\nCarpal tunnel syndrome\nCompression of the median nerve at the wrist is the most \nfrequent form. This seems hardly surprising when one \nremembers that the carpal tunnel, sandwiched between \nthe carpal bones and the carpal ligament, contains nine \nflexor tendons as well as the median nerve. These patients \ncomplain of numbness, pain and paraesthesiae in the \nmedian nerve distribution (the three radial fingers and \nthe radial side of the ring finger). It can be a sign of early \nrheumatoid arthritis. Symptoms often wake patients \nfrom sleep and may radiate up the forearm (one-third of \ncases) and involve the fourth and fifth fingers and wrist \nbut not the palm or dorsum of the hand—classic pattern. \nIf the palms are involved the pattern is called probable. \nThe largest group is idiopathic but overuse tenosynovitis \nof the flexor tendon sheaths at the wrist is also a cause. \nFluid retention during pregnancy or from use of the \noral contraceptive pill can also produce carpal tunnel \nsymptoms. In addition, median nerve compression can \noccur in hypothyroidism, acro­megaly and amyloidosis.\nExamination\nSymptoms can be reproduced by gentle percussion over \nthe carpal tunnel (which begins at the distal wrist crease) \nwhile the wrist is held in extension (Tinel’s sign—LR+, \n1.8; LR−, 0.8). This sign is negative in up to 30% of \npatients with electrophysiologically proven median \nnerve compression. Prolonged (60 seconds) passive \nwrist flexion (Phalen’s test) has a lower false-negative \nrate (LR+, 1.3; LR−, 0.7).4 Ask the patient: ‘What do \nyou do with your hands when the feeling is there?’ \nThe flick sign is positive when the patient demonstrates \na flicking movement with the wrist as if shaking a \nnon-electronic thermometer (LR+ 29; LR− 0.1—but \nonly in one study6). Look for wasting in the median \nnerve distribution and loss of motor (thenar muscle \nstrength: weak thumb abduction) and sensory function \n(sensation over the thenar eminence, however, is usually \npreserved). These signs occur only in advanced cases.\nMeralgiai paraesthetica\nCompression of the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh \ncauses paraesthesiae and sensory loss over the lateral \ni\t\nThe Greek word meros means ‘thigh’ and algia means ‘painful’.\n",

It presents with a variable group of symptoms \nincluding widespread musculoskeletal aches and pains, \nand usually with symptoms of chronic fatigue. There \nare often cognitive symptoms—forgetting of words or \ndifficulty in concentrating. The musculoskeletal pain \nis mostly axial (neck and back) and diffuse. It is made \nworse by stress or cold. Pain may be reported ‘all over’ \nunresponsive to anti-inflammatory drug treatment. The \ncombination of pain and fatigue may cause the patient \nsevere limitation. There is usually a poor sleep pattern. \nThe patient wakes up feeling unrefreshed and more \ntired in the morning than later in the day. There is \noften intolerance to exercise. Days of exhaustion may \nfollow any amount of exercise. Note that no abnormal \npathology has been found in the joints, muscles or \ntendons of these patients.\nExamination\nTest for the characteristic multiple hyperalgesic tender \npoints (see Fig. 25.24). These areas may be tender to \nfinger pressure in normal people, but in affected patients \nthere is marked tenderness and a definite withdrawal \nresponse. This response should be obtained in at least \n11 of 18 sites in the upper and lower limbs and on \nboth sides (i.e. it is widespread and symmetrical). Next \nexamine for hyperalgesia at control sites such as the \nforehead or distal forearm, where it should be absent.\nThe diagnosis was based on the presence of multiple \nhyperalgesic tender sites (with negative control sites) \nbut this is now thought to lead to overdiagnosis in \nwomen.7 Current diagnostic criteria include:\n•\t 3 months of self-reported pain at any of 19 \ndifferent sites (widespread pain index [WPI]—1 \npoint per site)\n•\t fatigue\n•\t waking unrefreshed\n•\t cognitive symptoms—these three (fatigue, \nwaking unrefreshed and cognitive symptoms) are \nscaled from 0 to 3 and the Symptoms Severity \nScale (SSS) calculated\n•\t a WPI >7 and SSS >5 or WPI 3–6 and SSS >9 is \nconsidered diagnostic of the condition.\nInflammatory and endocrine disease must be excluded.\n",

Note the \nlength of the stride, the smoothness of the walk \nand turning around, the stance, heel strike and \narm swing. Is walking painful? Hemiplegic, \nParkinsonian, foot drop and other neurological \ngaits should be obvious.\n2.\t Arms, legs and spine:\n○\t From behind: look at the spine for scoliosis, \nmuscle bulk of the shoulders, paraspinal \nmuscles, gluteal muscles and calves; look at \nthe iliac crests for loss of symmetry.\n○\t From the side: look for normal lordosis and \nthoracic kyphosis. Ask the patient to bend \nover and look for normal separation of \nlumbar spinous processes.\n○\t From in front: look for asymmetry or wasting \nof major muscle groups (shoulders, arms and \nquadriceps). Is there deformity of the knees, \nankles or feet?\nWhen arthritis seems likely to be an important \npart of the case, take the time to test \nmovement.

Testing is undertaken to confirm the clinical \ndiagnosis. Table 26.1 gives the current American College \nof Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for rheumatoid arthritis \n(RA)—a combination of clinical and laboratory findings.\nLaboratory testing\nKnow your autoimmune antibodies. Testing includes \nthe following:\n•\t Antinuclear antibody (ANA) is positive in high \ntitre in a number of autoimmune diseases \nincluding systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) \n(95%), drug-induced lupus, mixed connective \ntissue disease, scleroderma and Sjögren’s \nsyndrome (and ANA is positive in at least 5% of \nhealthy elderly patients). ANA is sensitive but \nnot specific.\n•\t If ANA is positive, testing for specific ANAs is \nhelpful—for example, anti-double stranded DNA \n(specific for SLE), anti-U1-RNP (very sensitive \nfor mixed connective tissue disease) and \nanticentromere antibody (CREST).\n•\t Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) \ncan be perinuclear in pattern (p-ANCA; e.g. \nChurg–Strauss syndrome) or homogeneous in \nthe neutrophil cytoplasm (c-ANCA; e.g. \ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis [GPA]—\nWegener’s granulomatosis).\n•\t Rheumatoid factor (RF, a polyclonal antibody of \nIgM and IgG classes) is present in only 70% of \npatients with rheumatoid arthritis and in 5% of \nunaffected people. Anti-cyclic citrullinated \npeptide (anti-CCP) is similar in sensitivity to RF \nfor the diagnosis of RA but much more specific. \nIt has largely replaced RF testing.\n•\t Complement components (C4 and C3) are \nreduced in SLE.\nScore\nA.

HARVEY CUSHING (1869–1939)\nPRESENTING SYMPTOMS\nHormones control so many aspects of body function \nthat the manifestations of endocrine disease are protean. \nAsk about:\n•\t changes in body weight\n•\t appetite\n•\t bowel habit\n•\t hair distribution\n•\t pigmentation\n•\t sweating\n•\t height\n•\t menstruation\n•\t galactorrhoea (unexpected breast-milk \nproduction—in men and women)\n•\t polydipsia\n•\t polyuria\n•\t lethargy\n•\t headaches\n•\t loss of libido and erectile dysfunction.\nBack pain and loss of height caused by vertebral \nfractures may be symptoms and signs of osteoporosis, \nwhich has endocrine and non-endocrine causes. Many \nof these symptoms have other causes as well and must \nbe carefully evaluated. On the other hand, the patient \nmay know which endocrine organ or group of endocrine \norgans has been causing a problem. Histories of thyroid \ndisease and diabetes mellitus are particularly common. \nA list of common symptoms associated with various \nendocrine diseases is presented in List 27.1. In this \nchapter some of the important symptoms associated \nwith endocrine disease are discussed.\nChanges in appetite \nand weight\nAn increased appetite associated with weight loss \nclassically occurs in thyrotoxicosis (due to an increase \nin metabolic activity) and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus \n(due to loss of glucose in the urine). An increased \nappetite with weight gain may occur in Cushing’s \nsyndrome (effects of excessive glucocorticoids), \nhypoglycaemia and hypothalamic disease. A loss \nof appetite with weight loss can occur with adrenal \ninsufficiency, but is also seen in anorexia nervosa and \nwith gastrointestinal disease (particularly malignancy). \nA loss of appetite with weight gain can occur in \nhypothyroidism (reduced metabolic activity).\nChanges in bowel habit\nDiarrhoea and an increase in the frequency of bowel \nmovements are associated with hyperthyroidism and \nadrenal insufficiency, whereas constipation may occur \nin hypothyroidism and hypercalcaemia. Autonomic \ndysfunction due to diabetes mellitus can result in \ndiarrhoea or constipation.\nChanges in sweating\nIncreased sweating is characteristic of hyperthyroidism, \nhypoglycaemia and acromegaly, but may also occur in \nanxiety states and at the menopause.\nChanges in hair distribution\nHirsutism refers to an increased growth of body hair \nin women.

Autonomic neuropathy \n(e.g. in diabetes mellitus or alcoholism), spinal cord \ndisease or testicular atrophy can also cause this problem.\nGalactorrhoea\nHyperprolactinaemia (usually the result of a pituitary \nadenoma) can cause galactorrhoea in up to 80% of \nwomen and 30% of men. Galactorrhoea in men occurs \nfrom a normal-appearing male breast.\nMenstruation\nFailure to menstruate is termed amenorrhoea. Primary \namenorrhoea is defined as a failure to start menstruating \nby 17 years of age. True primary amenorrhoea may \nresult from ovarian failure (e.g. X chromosomal \nabnormalities such as Turner’s syndrome), or from \npituitary or hypothalamic disease (e.g. tumour, trauma \nor idiopathic disease). Excess androgen production or \nsystemic disease (e.g. malabsorption, chronic kidney \ndisease, obesity) can also result in primary amenorrhoea. \nApparent primary amenorrhoea may also occur if \nmenstrual flow cannot escape—for example, if there \nis an imperforate hymen.\nSecondary amenorrhoea is defined as the cessation \nof menstruation for 6 months or more. Common \ncauses include pregnancy, menopause, polycystic \novarian syndrome, hyperprolactinaemia, virilising \nsyndromes or hypothalamic or pituitary disease. Use \nof the contraceptive pill, psychiatric disease and loss of \nweight of any cause, but especially as a result of anorexia \nnervosa, can also result in secondary amenorrhoea.\nPolyuria\nPolyuria is defined as a urine volume of more than 3 \nlitres / day. Patients who report urinary frequency may \nfind it difficult to tell whether large volumes of urine \nare being passed. Causes include diabetes mellitus (due \nto excessive filtration of glucose), diabetes insipidus \n(due to inadequate renal water conservation from a \ncentral deficiency of antidiuretic hormone, or a lack \nof renal responsiveness to this hormone), primary \npolydipsia—where a patient drinks excessive water \n(due to psychogenic or hypothalamic disease or drugs \nsuch as chlorpromazine or thioridazine or just simple \neccentricity), hypercalcaemia and tubulointerstitial or \ncystic renal disease.\nthe skin of the face and neck occurs in the carcinoid \nsyndrome (due to the release of vasoactive peptides \nfrom the tumour). Soft-tissue overgrowth occurs in \nacromegaly and skin tags called molluscum fibrinosum \nmay appear in the axillae. Acanthosis nigricans can \nalso occur in acromegaly and in insulin-resistant states \nincluding Cushing’s syndrome, polycystic ovarian \nsyndrome and obesity. Xanthelasmata may be present \nin patients with diabetes mellitus, lipid disorders or \nhypothyroidism.\nOnycholysis and rarely clubbing (called thyroid \nacropachy) and pretibial myxoedema may occur in \nGraves’ disease. Cushing’s syndrome is associated with \nspontaneous ecchymoses, thin skin and purple striae.\nChanges in pigmentation\nIncreased pigmentation may be reported in primary \nadrenal insufficiency, Cushing’s syndrome or acromegaly. \nDecreased pigmentation occurs in hypopituitarism. \nLocalised depigmentation is characteristic of vitiligo \n(see Fig. 28.16), which may be associated with certain \nendocrine diseases such as Hashimoto’sa disease and \nAddison’s disease (autoimmune adrenal insufficiency) \nand other autoimmune conditions.\nChanges in stature\nTallness may occur in children for constitutional reasons \n(tall parents) or, rarely, may reflect growth hormone \nexcess (leading to gigantism), gonadotrophin deficiency, \nKlinefelter’sb syndrome, Marfan’s syndrome or \ngeneralised lipodystrophy. Short stature can also result \nfrom endocrine disease, as discussed on page 473. A \nloss of height of greater than 5 centimetres may indicate \nvertebral fractures and underlying osteoporosis.\nErectile dysfunction \n(impotence)\nA persistent inability to attain or sustain penile erections \nmay occasionally be due to primary hypogonadism or \nto secondary hypogonadism due to hyperprolactinaemia \nor hypopituitarism.

Patients with \nmetabolic syndrome have twice the risk of developing \ncardiovascular disease and five times the risk of \ndeveloping type 2 diabetes.\nPAST HISTORY AND \nTREATMENT\nA previous history of any endocrine condition must \nbe uncovered. This includes surgery on the neck. A \npartial thyroidectomy or radioiodine (131I) treatment \nin the past can lead to eventual hypothyroidism. The \nsame may apply to any radiation to the neck (e.g. \nfor carcinoma). A woman may have been diagnosed \nwith diabetes mellitus after the birth of a large baby. \nThere may be a history of hypertension, which is \noccasionally due to an endocrine condition (e.g. \nphaeochromocytoma, Cushing’s syndrome or Conn’s \nsyndrome). Previous thyroid surgery can be associated \nwith hypoparathyroidism because of surgical damage \nto the parathyroid glands. Previous head injury may be \na cause of pituitary or hypothalamic damage. Cranial \nirradiation for childhood leukaemia or brain tumours \nmay eventually result in hypopituitarism.\nPrevious treatment of a patient’s thyroid problems \nmay have included the use of antithyroid drugs, thyroid \nhormone or radioactive iodine. Surgery on the adrenals \nor pituitary may have been performed and this may \nleave the patient with decreased adrenal or pituitary \nfunction.\nPatients with diabetes mellitus have an important \nchronic condition. Treatment may be with diet, insulin, \nor drugs (e.g. metformin, sulphonylurea, glucagon-\nlike insulinotropic peptide 1 [GLP-1] analogues). One \nmust determine how well the patient understands the \ncondition, and whether he or she understands the \nprinciples of the diabetic diet and adheres to it. Find \nout how the blood glucose levels are monitored and \nwhether or not the patient adjusts the insulin dose. \nMost patients should be able to monitor their blood \nglucose levels at home using a glucose meter. There is \nnow good evidence that tight control of blood glucose \nlevels reduces the incidence of diabetic complications. \nPatients should have records of home blood glucose \nmeasurements, and may know the results of tests such \nas the haemoglobin A1c (a surrogate marker of average \nblood glucose levels) and of tests of renal function and \nfor protein in the urine.\nThe patient should be aware of the need for care of \nthe feet and eyes to prevent complications. Most patients \nwith diabetes have regular ophthalmological reviews, \noften using retinal photography. There may be a history \nof laser treatment or vascular endothelial growth factor \n(VEGF) inhibitor injections for proliferative diabetic \nretinopathy.\nPatients with hypopituitarism or hypoadrenalism \nmay be on glucocorticoid (steroid) replacement; the \nlatter may also require mineralocorticoid replacement. \nDetails of the patient’s dosage schedule should be \nobtained.\nPatients may know of a diagnosis of osteoporosis.c \nThis may have been made following spontaneous \nfractures or as a result of screening tests for bone \n",

Usually, there will be some clue from \nthe history and general inspection to indicate what \nspecific endocrine disease should be pursued.\nTHE THYROID\nThe thyroid gland\nExamination anatomy\nEven when it is not enlarged, the thyroida (see Fig. \n28.1) is the largest endocrine gland (see Fig. 28.2). \nEnlargement is common, occurring in 10% of women \nand 2% of men and more commonly in iodine-deficient \nparts of the world. The normal gland lies anterior to \nthe larynx and trachea and below the laryngeal \nprominence of the thyroid cartilage. It consists of a \nnarrow isthmus in the middle line (anterior to the \nsecond to fourth tracheal rings and 1.5 centimetres \nin size) and two larger lateral lobes each about \n4 centimetres long. Although the position of the larynx \nvaries, the thyroid gland is almost always about \n4 centimetres below the larynx.\nInspection\nThe normal thyroid may be just visible below the \ncricoid cartilage in a thin young person.1,2 Usually \nonly the isthmus is visible as a diffuse central swelling. \nApparent enlargement (pseudogoitre) can occur as a \nresult of the presence of a fat pad in the anterior and \nlateral part of the neck; this finding is more common \nin people who are overweight but can occur in those \nof normal weight. Enlargement of the gland, called a \na\t The first person to distinguish an enlarged thyroid from cervical \nlymphadenopathy was the Roman medical writer Aulus Aurelius Cornelius \nCelsus (approx. 53 BC–AD 7).

Look at the front and sides of the neck and \ndecide whether there is localised or general swelling of \nthe gland. In healthy people the line between the cricoid \ncartilage and the suprasternal notch should be straight. \nAn outward bulge suggests the presence of goitre (see \nFig. 28.3). Remember that 80% of people with goitre \nare biochemically euthyroid, 10% are hypothyroid and \n10% are hyperthyroid.\nThe temptation to begin touching a swelling as soon \nas it has been detected should be resisted until a glass \nof water has been procured. The patient takes sips from \nthis repeatedly so that swallowing is possible without \ndiscomfort. Ask the patient to swallow, and watch the \nneck swelling carefully.

Many of the \nclinical features of thyrotoxicosis are characterised by \nsigns of sympathetic nervous system overactivity such \nas tremor, tachycardia and sweating. The explanation \nis not entirely clear. Catecholamine secretion is usually \nnormal in hyperthyroidism; however, thyroid hormone \npotentiates the effects of catecholamines, possibly by \nincreasing the number of adrenergic receptors in the \ntissues.\nThe most common cause of thyrotoxicosis in young \npeople is Graves’d disease, an autoimmune disease \nwhere circulating immunoglobulins stimulate thyroid-\nstimulating hormone (TSH) receptors on the surface \nof the thyroid follicular cells (see List 28.5 below).\nExamine a suspected case of thyrotoxicosis as \nfollows.\nGeneral inspection\nLook for signs of weight loss, anxiety and the frightened \nfacies of thyrotoxicosis.\nHands\nAsk the patient to put out his or her arms and look \nfor a fine tremor (due to sympathetic overactivity). \nLaying a sheet of paper over the patient’s fingers may \nmore clearly demonstrate this tremor, to the amazement \nof less-experienced colleagues.\nLook at the nails for onycholysis (Plummer’se nails; \nsee Fig. 28.6).

Note the presence of sinus tachycardia \n(sympathetic overdrive) or atrial fibrillation (due to a \nshortened refractory period of atrial cells related to \nsympathetic drive and hormone-induced changes).

In Graves’ disease \nthe gland is classically diffusely enlarged and is smooth \nand firm. An associated thrill is usually present, but \nthis finding is not specific for thyrotoxicosis caused \nby Graves’ disease.

Patients with de Quervain’s \nthyroiditis typically have a moderately enlarged \nfirm and tender gland.

These are \nan important sign of pituitary hypothyroidism. \nOccasionally, pituitary hypothyroid patients may be \nslightly overweight, but the classical myxoedematous \nappearance is usually absent.\nAcromegaly\nAcromegalyk is excessive secretion of growth hormone, \ntypically due to an eosinophilic pituitary adenoma. \nGrowth hormone stimulates the liver and other tissues \nto produce somatomedins, which in turn promote \ngrowth. Growth hormone is also a protein anabolic \nhormone exerting its effects at the ribosomal level, \nand it is diabetogenic as it exerts an anti-insulin effect \nin muscle and increases hepatic glucose release. The \ndisease has a very gradual onset and patients may \nnot have noticed symptoms. Most patients, however, \nhave headache caused by stretching of the dura by the \nenlarging pituitary tumour.\nGigantism is the result of growth hormone \nhypersecretion occurring before puberty and fusion \nof the epiphyses. It results in massive skeletal as well \nas soft-tissue growth. Acromegaly occurs when the \ngrowth plates have fused, so that only soft-tissue and \nflat-bone enlargements are possible.\nGeneral inspection\nThe face and body habitus may be characteristic (see \nFigs 28.10 and 28.12).\nHands\nSit the patient on the side of the bed or in a chair and \nlook at his or her hands.

Examine \nthe heart for signs of arrhythmias, cardiomegaly and \ncongestive cardiac failure, which may be due to \nischaemic heart disease, hypertension or cardiomyopathy \n(all more common in acromegaly).\nBack\nInspect for kyphosis.\nAbdomen\nExamine for hepatic, splenic and renal enlargement, \nand look for testicular atrophy (the latter indicating \ngonadotrophin deficiency secondary to an enlarging \npituitary tumour). Acromegaly may be associated \nwith a mixed pituitary tumour, and resultant \nhyperprolactinaemia can also cause testicular atrophy.\nLower limbs\nLook for signs of osteoarthritis in the hips especially, \nand knees (Ch 24), and for pseudogout. Foot drop may \nbe present because of common peroneal nerve \nentrapment (p 576).\nSigns of activity\nDecide whether or not the disease is active. Signs of \nactive disease include:\n•\t large numbers of skin tags (however, these can \noccur commonly in healthy people in parts of \nthe skin subject to friction, e.g. in the axillae, \nespecially in people who are overweight)\n•\t excessive sweating\n•\t the presence of glycosuria\n•\t increasing visual field loss\n•\t enlarging goitre\n•\t hypertension.\nNote: Headache also suggests disease activity.\nUrinalysis and blood pressure\nTest the urine for glucose, as excess growth hormone \nis diabetogenic in 25% of cases. Take the blood pressure \nto test for hypertension.\nOther pituitary syndromes\nCushing’s syndrome can occur as a result of excess \npituitary ACTH secretion but has other causes as well. \nHyperthyroidism can occur as a result of excess pituitary \nTSH production. Prolactinomas of the pituitary can \ncause galactorrhoea (production of milk) in both \nwomen and men.\nTHE ADRENALS\nCushing’s syndrome\nCushing’s syndrome is due to a chronic excess of \nglucocorticoids. Steroids have multiple effects on the \nbody, due to stimulation of the DNA-dependent \nsynthesis of select messenger ribonucleic acids \n(mRNAs). This leads to the formation of enzymes that \nalter cell function and result in increased protein \ncatabolism and gluconeogenesis. Remember that \nCushing’s disease is specifically pituitary ACTH \noverproduction, whereas Cushing’s syndrome is due \nto excessive steroid hormone production from any \ncause (see List 28.8, Good signs guide 28.3 and \nQuestions box 28.4).\n",

Rather courageously, they distinguished diabetes mellitus from \ndiabetes insipidus by the sweet taste of the urine: mellitus, ‘sweet, honeyed’; \ninsipidus, ‘tasteless’.\nLower limbs\nUnlike most other systematic examinations, assessment \nof the patient with diabetes can profitably begin with \nthe legs, as many of the major physical signs are to be \nfound here. In particular, vascular and neurological \nabnormalities in the feet must not be missed.1\nInspection\nLook at the skin. The skin of the feet and lower legs \nmay be hairless and atrophied due to small-vessel \nvascular disease and resultant ischaemia (the mechanism \nis uncertain, but may be related to lipoprotein alterations \nin the vessel walls).\nNote any leg ulcers, particularly on the toes or any \narea of the feet exposed to pressure (see Fig. 29.2). \nThese ulcers are due to a combination of ischaemia and \nperipheral neuropathy (the cause of the neuropathy is \nunknown, but may be related to small-vessel ischaemia \nand glycosylation of neural proteins). Look at the \nankles for signs of a Charcot’s joint (grossly deformed \ndisorganised joints, due to loss of proprioception or \npain, or both; this leads to recurrent and unnoticed \ninjury to the joint). Damage to the skin unprotected \nby pain sensation can also occur.\nLook for superficial skin infection, such as boils, \ncellulitis and fungal infections. These are more common \nin patients with diabetes because of a combination of \nhigh tissue glucose levels and ischaemia, which provides \na favourable environment for the growth of organisms.\nNote any pigmented scars (late diabetic dermopathy). \nThere may be small rounded plaques with raised \nborders lying in a linear fashion over the shins (diabetic \ndermopathy).\nNecrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum is a reasonably \nspecific skin manifestation of diabetes mellitus, but is \nDIABETES MELLITUS\nDiabetes mellitusa is characterised by hyperglycaemia \ndue to an absolute or a relative deficiency of insulin. \nThe causes of diabetes are outlined in List 29.1. The \ndisease can present with asymptomatic glycosuria \ndetected on routine physical examination or with \nsymptoms of diabetes (see List 27.1 on p 440), ranging \nfrom polyuria to coma as a result of diabetic ketoacidosis \n(see Questions box 29.1), or hyperosmolar hyperglycemia \nsyndrome.\nGeneral inspection\nAssess for evidence of dehydration because the osmotic \ndiuresis caused by a glucose load in the urine can cause \nmassive fluid loss. Note obesity (type 2 diabetics are \nusually obese) or signs of recent weight loss (this can \nbe evidence of uncontrolled glycosuria).\nLook for one of the abnormal endocrine facies \n(e.g. Cushing’s syndrome or acromegaly) and for \npigmentation (e.g. haemochromatosis—bronze diabetes) \nas these may cause secondary diabetes.\nThe patient may be comatose due to dehydration, \nacidosis or plasma hyperosmolality. Kussmaul’s \nbreathing (‘air hunger’) is present in diabetic ketoacidosis \ndue to the acidosis (this occurs because fat metabolism \nis increased to compensate for the lack of availability \nof glucose; excess acetyl-coenzyme A is produced, which \nis converted in the liver to ketone bodies, and two of \nthese are organic acids).\n",

For \nexample, for a patient with a possible goitre you need \nto define the mass properly to confirm that the thyroid \nis enlarged and identify its characteristics (including \nany retrosternal extension) and whether there are \nsigns of thyrotoxicosis or alternatively hypothyroidism. \nRemember that thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism \ncan be present in the absence of goitre (which you \nmay suspect from your initial and important general \ninspection)! You may suspect Cushing’s syndrome on \nfirst seeing the patient; your examination then needs \nto be tailored to look for the signs that will confirm \nyour initial impression (or not). Remember that \nCushing’s syndrome and obesity can be difficult to \ndifferentiate even on initial biochemical testing. The \nastute clinician may also recognise one of the endocrine \nspot diagnoses (List 30.1) on first encountering the \npatient. On the other hand, diabetes mellitus may \nbe diagnosed only after a routine blood glucose \nlevel has been measured, but if you know that the \npatient has diabetes you should routinely look for the \ncomplications of the disease as part of your clinical \nexamination.\nA summary of an approach to suspected endocrine \ndisease is presented in Text box 30.1 as a guide, but the \nmethod must be tailored to the disease you suspect and \nyou should not look for obviously irrelevant problems.\nEXTENDING THE \nENDOCRINE PHYSICAL \nEXAMINATION\nDiagnostic testing\nTo interpret investigations for endocrine diseases you \nneed to understand the physiology of hormonal \nregulation (the classic hormonal feedback cycles). \nTypically, biochemical testing is undertaken to identify \nthe hormonal abnormality and then imaging may be \nperformed to determine the anatomical lesion. Some \nintroductory examples are given below.\nPituitary testing\nTesting usually involves measuring the basal \nconcentrations of the anterior pituitary hormones in \nthe basal state (usually taken in the morning) and \nmeasuring the hormones produced by the target glands.\nENDOCRINE SPOT DIAGNOSES\n1.\t Acromegaly\n2.\t Cushing’s syndrome\n3.\t Addison’s disease\n4.\t Thyrotoxicosis\n5.\t Myxoedema\n6.\t Panhypopituitarism\n7.\t Virilisation\n8.\t Paget’s disease\nLIST 30.1 \n",

      "text": "482\t\nSECTION 8  The endocrine system\nBlood glucose\nA fasting blood glucose level (BGL) is usually ordered \nto make the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Do not \nforget the criteria for this diagnosis: a fasting (overnight) \nblood glucose level of 7.0 mmol / L or higher on at least \ntwo separate occasions, or, in the absence of fasting \nhyperglycaemia, a 2-hour postprandial glucose level \nof 11.1 mmol / L or higher. Fasting blood glucose \nlevels between 6.1 and 7.0 mmol / L are considered \nto represent impaired fasting glucose levels. In a \npatient with symptoms of diabetes, a random BGL of \n≥11.1 mmol / L or single fasting glucose reading above \n7.0 mmol / L is diagnostic.\nThe pituitary–adrenal axis may require dynamic \ntesting. If the morning cortisol level is low (<150 nmol / \nL), a hypoglycaemia stimulation test (insulin tolerance \ntest [ITT]) is performed. Intravenous insulin is given \nuntil the blood glucose level is <2.2 mmol / L. This will \nnormally raise plasma cortisol (via adrenocorticotrophic \nhormone [ACTH] release) and growth hormone (GH) \nlevels (which are usually pulsatile and can be very low \nin normal people between pulses). Failure of the levels \nto rise (peak cortisol <500 nmol / L, GH <9 mU / L) \nmeans a deficient pituitary response.\nThyroid function testing\nThyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screens for thyroid \ndisease: if the TSH is low or high, the thyroxine (T4) \nlevel is measured. In hypothyroidism, the TSH is high \nbecause the thyroid is unresponsive and the pituitary \nincreases TSH production; the low T4 level confirms \nthe diagnosis. In hyperthyroidism, the TSH is low \nbecause the thyroid is producing thyroxine, which \nsuppresses pituitary production of TSH; the high T4 \nlevel confirms the diagnosis.\nIf a single nodule is detected on thyroid examination, \nit is important to check the TSH and order a \nthyroid nuclear scan. If the TSH is low, suggesting \nhyperthyroidism, thyroid scintigraphy can identify \nwhether the nodule is hyperfunctioning (a ‘hot’ nodule; \nsee Fig. 30.2) or not secreting (a ‘cold’ nodule)—the \nlatter may be malignant and an ultrasound (see Fig. \n30.3) is indicated.\nFrom the ultrasound image one can tell whether \nthe nodule is solid or not. If the nodule is solid and \nlarge (>1 centimetre) with worrying ultrasonographic \nfeatures a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) under \nultrasound guidance can help identify whether there is \nmalignancy.\nThe endocrine system: a suggested method of examination continued\nTEXT BOX 30.1 \nExamine the neck for thyroid enlargement. \nNote any neck webbing (Turner’s syndrome). \nPalpate for supraclavicular fat pads (Cushing’s \nsyndrome).\nInspect the chest wall for hirsutism or loss of \nbody hair, reduction in breast size in women \n(panhypopituitarism) or gynaecomastia in men. \nLook for nipple pigmentation (Addison’s disease). \nMeasure the occiput to wall distance if \nosteoporosis or osteomalacia is suspected.\nExamine the abdomen for hirsutism, central fat \ndeposition and purple striae (Cushing’s syndrome) \nand the external genitalia for virilisation or \natrophy.

The test relies on the fact that glucose \nfreely permeates red blood cells and attaches to \nhaemoglobin (irreversibly); red cells live for 120 days. \nThe management goal for most patients is to achieve \nnormal or near-normal blood glucose levels as indicated \nby an A1c of 52 mmol / L (<7%) in order to reduce the \ncomplications of diabetes. There is evidence that \ncomplications of diabetes may occur in some populations \nwhen the fasting glucose level is over 6.1 mmol / L. \nAn A1c level of ≥48 mmol / mol (≥6.5%) is consistent \nwith a diagnosis of diabetes.\nCushing’s syndrome\nYou may suspect this syndrome of cortisol excess \nclinically and this may be reinforced by routine blood \ntests (e.g. a low potassium with alkalosis, a high blood \nglucose level). You should then order special biochemical \ntests to screen for the diagnosis (midnight cortisol \nlevels, 24-hour urine free cortisol or an overnight 1 mg \ndexamethasone suppression test where the morning \ncortisol level fails to suppress). To confirm the diagnosis, \na higher-dose dexamethasone suppression test can be \nordered and the ACTH level measured, followed, if \nindicated, by brain computed tomography (CT) or \nMRI scanning to identify whether there is a pituitary \ntumour (Cushing’s disease; see Fig. 30.4). Adrenal \ndisease (e.g. a cortisol-secreting adenoma; see Fig. \n30.5) can also cause a Cushingoid appearance. Ectopic \nACTH production (e.g. from a small-cell carcinoma of \nthe lung), on the other hand, does not usually cause \nclassical Cushingoid clinical features, but may cause \npigmentation.\nAddison’s disease\nYou may suspect chronic adrenal insufficiency on \nroutine blood tests (e.g. low sodium and high potassium \non serum electrolytes).

The \npatient should be allowed to describe the symptoms \nin his or her own words to begin with, and then the \nclinician needs to ask questions to clarify information \nand obtain more detail. It is particularly important to \nascertain the temporal course of the illness, as this may \ngive important information about the underlying \naetiology.\nAn acute onset of symptoms (seconds to minutes) \nis suggestive of a vascular or convulsive problem (e.g. \nthe explosive severe headache of subarachnoid \nhaemorrhage or the rapid onset of a seizure).\nThese episodes of sudden onset may feature a \nprecipitating event (e.g. exercise) or warning (aura) \nmay be present. The aura that precedes a seizure is in \nfact a partial (focal) seizure, and may be localising (e.g. \nauditory hallucinations, an unusual smell or taste, loss \nof speech or motor changes) or non-localising (e.g. a \nfeeling of apprehension). The occurrence of an aura \nfollowed by sudden unconsciousness is very suggestive \nof the diagnosis of a complex partial seizure.\nA strokea usually causes symptoms that appear over \nseconds to minutes.

The rapid onset of \nfocal symptoms without seizure almost always has a \nvascular cause: infarction or haemorrhage. If the patient \ncan answer questions it is important to ask about the \nonset of the symptoms and about risk factors for stroke \n(see Questions box 31.1).\nThe onset of weakness on one side of the body \nfollowed by resolution and a severe headache is \ncharacteristic of hemiplegic migraine, but in elderly \npatients especially there may be no headache. This \nmakes the distinction from a transient ischaemic \nepisode difficult.\nb\t If brain imaging shows an infarction or bleed the diagnosis is of a stroke \nrather than a TIA even if the symptoms are brief.\nA subacute onset occurs with infection (meningitis \nor encephalitis; hours to days) and inflammatory \ndisorders (e.g. Guillain–Barréc syndrome—acute \ninflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy, myasthenia \ngravis, polymyositis; days to weeks).\nA more insidious onset suggests that the underlying \ndisorder may be related to either a tumour (weeks to \nmonths) or a degenerative process (months to years). \nMetabolic or toxic disorders may present with any of \nthese time courses.\nBased on the history (and physical examination), \na judgement is made as to whether the disease process \nis localised or diffuse, and which levels of the nervous \nsystem are involved; the nervous system may be thought \nof as having four different levels:\n1.\tthe peripheral nervous system\n2.\tthe spinal cord\n3.\tthe posterior fossa (cerebellum and brainstem)\n4.\tthe cerebral hemisphere.\nConsideration of the time course and the levels of \ninvolvement will usually lead to a logical differential \ndiagnosis of the patient’s symptoms. After detailed \nquestions about the presenting problem, ask about \nprevious neurological symptoms and about previous \nneurological diagnoses or investigations. The patient \nmay know the results of CT or MRI brain scans \nperformed in the past. A thorough neurological \nhistory will include routine questions about possible \nneurological symptoms (see Questions box 31.2).

It may occur in the setting \nof temporal lobe sclerosis.\n•\t A focal dyscognitive seizure may cause altered \nconsciousness without collapse. Typically the \npatient begins to stare blankly and then to make \nautomatic repetitive movements such as picking \nat the clothes or smacking the lips.

Often the patient is incontinent of urine \nand faeces, and the tongue may be bitten, though these \nfeatures are of limited diagnostic value in themselves.\nAbsence seizures are also generalised seizures, with \nsynchronous, generalised electrical activity within the \nbrain. They present in children and adolescents and \nmay persist into adulthood. They are frequent (up to \n200 times a day) brief episodes of loss of awareness \noften associated with staring. Major motor movements \ndo not occur with this type of epilepsy. The presence \nof an aura or other focal symptoms (posturing, focal \ntwitching, etc.) indicates that the seizures are not \nabsences.\nOther forms of generalised seizure include \nmyoclonus (brief twitches or jerks, often present when \ntired and in the mornings) and atonic seizures.\nEpilepsy in children (especially when characterised \nby atonic seizures) may be associated with developmental \nabnormalities and is often genetic. Epilepsy in adults \npreviously considered idiopathic may also have a genetic \nbasis, or may be the result of trauma, tumour or stroke.\nT&O’C ESSENTIAL\nRemember: epilepsy is the condition of being \naffected by seizures; seizures are the epileptic \nevents.\nTransient ischaemic attacks affecting the brainstem \nonly rarely cause blackouts. They are generally associated \nwith focal neurological symptoms or signs. Use of the \nterm ‘drop attacks’ means the patient falls but there is \nno loss of consciousness. In either case the patient falls \nto the ground without premonition and the attacks are \nof brief duration. Hypoglycaemia can lead to episodes \nof loss of consciousness. Patients with hypoglycaemia \nmay also report sweating, weakness and confusion \nbefore losing consciousness. They are usually diabetics \nwho are taking insulin or an oral hypoglycaemic drug.\nSometimes bizarre, but often convincing, attacks \nof loss of consciousness occur in conversion disorder. \nThese are referred to as psychogenic non-epileptic \nseizures (PNES). They do not respond to anticonvulsants, \nand a correct diagnosis is critical to prevent incorrect \ntreatment (see List 31.3).\n",

The causes of \ndeafness are summarised on page 531.\nDisturbances of gait\nMany neurological conditions can make walking \ndifficult. These are described on page 577. Walking \nmay also be abnormal when orthopaedic disease affects \nthe lower limbs or spine. A bizarrely abnormal gait \ncan sometimes be a sign of a conversion disorder \n(hysteria).\nDisturbed sensation or \nweakness in the limbs\nPins and needles in the hands or feet may indicate \nnerve entrapment or a peripheral neuropathy (p 583) \nbut can result from sensory pathway involvement at \nany level. The carpal tunnel syndrome is common: here \nthere is median nerve entrapment, and patients \nexperience pain and paraesthesias in the hand and \nwrist. Sometimes pain may extend to the arm and even \nto the shoulder, but paraesthesias are felt only in the \nfingers. These symptoms are usually worse at night \nand may be relieved by dangling the arm over the side \nof the bed or shaking the hand (the flick sign).\nNerve root, spinal cord and cerebral abnormalities \ncan all cause disturbance of sensation and weakness.\nLimb weakness can be caused by lesions at different \nlevels in the motor system. There are a number of \npatterns of limb and muscle weakness:\n•\t Upper motor neurone (UMN) weakness (p 580) \nis due to interruption of a neural pathway at a \nlevel above the anterior horn cell. The result is an \nincrease in tone and peripheral reflexes. \nInterruption of this pathway has the greatest \neffect on the antigravity muscles and is called \npyramidal weakness. There is little or no muscle \nwasting.\n•\t Lower motor neurone (LMN) weakness (p 582) \nis due to a lesion that interrupts the reflex arc \nbetween the anterior horn cell and the muscle. \nThere is a reduction in tone and reflexes, \nfasciculation (irregular contractions of small \nareas of muscle) may be seen and muscle wasting \nis prominent.\n•\t Muscle disease causes weakness in a particular \nmuscle or group of muscles. There is wasting and \ndecreased tone, and the reflexes are reduced or \nabsent.\n•\t Disease at the neuromuscular junction (e.g. \nmyasthenia gravis, p 593) causes generalised \nweakness, which worsens with repetition. The \nreflexes and tone are often normal.\n•\t Non-organic weakness (e.g. due to hysteria) \ncauses a non-anatomical pattern of weakness in \nassociation with normal tone and power and, \nunless there has been prolonged disuse, normal \nmuscle bulk.\nTremor and involuntary \nmovements\nTremor is a rhythmical movement (see Table 31.3). A \nslow tremor has, by definition, a rate between 3 Hz \nand 5 Hz. Rapid tremors are faster than 10 Hz.\nTremors can be described as resting, postural or \naction, and sometimes there are elements of each. \nResting tremors are present mostly during relaxation \nof the muscles, and may not be noticed by the patient \nas much as by others. Postural tremors occur when \nthe limbs are used, and may cause problems when the \npatient holds a cup or writes. Action (‘intention’) tremors \noccur with deliberate movement and become more \npronounced towards the end of the action (they get \nworse towards the target).\nMost tremors become worse with fatigue or anxiety. \nShivering is a type of tremor brought on by cold. It is \nnormal for there to be a fine tremor associated with \nholding a posture or performing a movement slowly. \nThis is called a physiological tremor.

EDISON (1847–1931)\nA PREAMBLE REGARDING \nTHE NEUROLOGICAL \nEXAMINATION\nThe importance of clarity and simplicity when \nundertaking the neurological examination can’t be \noverstated. Instructions to the patient should be short \nand simple, and physical demonstration of what you \nwant the person to do is invaluable (except when testing \nspeech and language). It is much easier to demonstrate \na position you wish a person to hold, then to ask him \nor her to ‘push up or down’ than to give long strings \nof instructions. Patients will invariably get it wrong \nwhen given too many instructions to follow.\nEXAMINATION ANATOMY\nMore than for any other system of the body, neurological \ndiagnosis depends on localising the anatomical site of \nthe lesion—in the brain, spinal cord or peripheral nerve. \nFig. 32.1 shows the gross anatomy of the brain and the \nmajor functional areas.\nThe examination of the nervous system and the \ninterpretation of findings require a lot of practice. In \na viva voce examination, this system more than any \nother requires a polished technique. The signs need to \nbe elicited carefully because the precise anatomical \nlocalisation of any lesions can often be determined this \nway. It is important, therefore, to remember some \nelementary neuroanatomy.\nExamination can be long and difficult and it is said \nto take much of a day if absolutely everything that \ncan be done (including psychometric assessment) is \ndone. This is obviously impractical, but a screening \nexamination that will uncover most signs takes only \na relatively short time.\nThe following aspects of the examination should \nbe attended to:\n1.\tGeneral, including examination for neck \nstiffness, assessment of the higher centres, speech \nand abnormal movements.\n2.\tCranial nerves I to XII.\n3.\tUpper limbs. Motor system: inspection, tone, \npower, reflexes, coordination.

If the patient is \nunconscious,a look for responses to various stimuli \n(p 601).\nNeck stiffness\nAny patient with an acute neurological illness or who \nis febrile or has altered mental status must be assessed \nfor signs of meningism.1\nWith the patient lying flat in bed, slip your hand \nunder the occiput and gently flex the neck passively \n(i.e. without assistance from the patient). Bring the \npatient’s chin up to approach the chest wall. The \nhead, neck and shoulders will rise if there is true \nneck stiffness. Meningism may be caused by pyogenic \nor other infection of the meninges, or by blood in \nthe subarachnoid space secondary to subarachnoid \nhaemorrhage. There is resistance to neck flexion due to \npainful spasm of the extensor muscles of the neck. Other \ncauses of resistance to neck flexion are characterised \nby an equal resistance to head rotation. They include:\n1.\tcervical spondylosis\n2.\tafter cervical fusion\n3.\tParkinson’s disease\n4.\traised intracranial pressure, especially if there is \nimpending tonsillar herniation.\nBrudzinski’sb sign is spontaneous flexion of the hips \nduring flexion of the neck by the examiner and indicates \nmeningism.\nKernig’sc sign should also be elicited if meningitis \nis suspected. Flex each hip in turn, then attempt to \nstraighten the knee while keeping the hip flexed. This \nis greatly limited by spasm of the hamstrings (which \nin turn causes pain) when there is meningism due to \nan inflammatory exudate around the lumbar spinal \nroots.\nAlthough the diagnostic value has been questioned \n(combined meningeal signs had a positive LR of 0.92 \nand a negative LR of 0.88),1 these signs are useful \nb\t Josef Brudzinski (1874–1917), a Polish paediatrician, described this in 1909.\nc\t Vladimir Kernig (1840–1917), a St Petersburg neurologist, described this \nin 1882.\nd\t The anatomy and function of the cranial nerves was well established by \nthe late 19th century. Galen identified at least seven of the cranial nerves \nin the 2nd century. These were probably the optic, the oculomotor, the \nsensory part of the trigeminal, the motor part of the trigeminal, the facial, \nthe vestibular, the glossopharyngeal (including the vagus and accessory) \nand the hypoglossal nerves.\na\t If the patient in an OSCE exam is unconscious, it may be best to ask \nwhether another patient can be provided.\nclinically and they have good specificity. However, even \nthe absence of all three items in the classical meningitis \ntriad—fever, headache and neck stiffness—does not \nrule out meningitis (i.e. they are not very sensitive).2\nHandedness\nShake the patient’s hand and ask whether he or she \nis right- or left-handed. This is polite and allows you \nto assess the likely dominant hemisphere—94% of \nright-handed people and about 50% of left-handed \npeople have a dominant left hemisphere. There is \ndivision of function between the two hemispheres, \nthe most obvious distinction being that the dominant \nhemisphere controls language and mathematical \nfunctions.\nOrientation\nTest orientation in person, place and time by asking \nthe patient his or her name, present location and the \ndate (patients who have been in hospital for long \nperiods often get the day wrong as one day seems very \nmuch like another in hospital). Disorientation is not a \nspecific localising sign and may be acute and reversible \n(delirium) or chronic and irreversible (dementia). \nThe Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) or \nmini-mental state examination (MMSE) are useful \ntools for documenting the progress of a confusional \nstate or of dementia over time.\nNext we focus on the head and neck—in particular, \nthe cranial nerves. Subsequent chapters cover speech \nand the upper and lower limb neurological examinations.\nTHE CRANIAL NERVES\nExamination anatomy\nThe cranial nervesd (see Fig. 32.2 and Table 32.1) arise \nas direct extensions of the brain (I and II) or from the \nbrainstem (midbrain, pons and medulla)—see Figs \n32.12, 32.21 and 32.38 respectively.

He separated the vestibulocochlear \nfrom the facial nerve, and the glossopharyngeal from the vagus and \naccessory nerve.\nThe cranial nerves are usually tested in \napproximately the order of their number.3\nThe first (olfactory) nerve\nExamination anatomy\nThe first (olfactory) nervef is a purely sensory nerve \nwhose fibres arise in the mucous membrane of the \nnose and pass through the cribriform plate of the \nethmoid bone to synapse in the olfactory bulb. From \nhere the olfactory tract runs under the frontal lobe \nand terminates in the medial temporal lobe on the \nsame side.\nExamination of the nose and sense \nof smell\nThe first nerve is not tested routinely. If the patient \ncomplains of loss of smell (anosmia) or taste, or there \nare other signs suggesting a frontal or temporal lobe \nlesion, then it may be examined. Anosmic patients \nsometimes complain of loss of taste rather than loss \nof smell because the sense of smell plays a large part \nin the appreciation of taste.\nNote the external appearance of the nose. Look for \nrash or deformity. Then examine the nasal vestibule \nby elevating the tip of the nose (in adults a speculum \nis usually needed to give an adequate view).\nTest smell with a series of bottles containing essences \nof familiar smells, such as coffee, vanilla and peppermint \n(this is traditional, but not very reliable). Scratch and \nsmell cards can be used somewhat more conveniently. \nPungent substances such as ammonia should not be \nused, first because they upset the patient and second \nbecause noxious stimuli of this sort are detected by \nsensory fibres of the fifth (trigeminal) nerve. An easy \nway to test smell is to use the isopropyl alcohol wipes \npresent in most hospital clinics. These have a distinctive \nand non-pungent smell.\nExamination of the nasal passages must be \nperformed if anosmia is present. Polyps and mucosal \nthickening may be seen and may explain the findings.\nCauses of anosmia\nMost cases of anosmia are bilateral. Causes include:\n1.\tupper respiratory tract infection (most \ncommon)\n2.\tsmoking and increasing age\n3.\tethmoid tumours\n4.\tbasal skull fracture or frontal fracture, or after \npituitary surgery\n5.\tcongenital—for example, Kallmann’s syndrome \n(hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism)\n6.\tmeningioma of the olfactory groove\n7.\tfollowing meningitis.\nThe main unilateral causes are head trauma without a \nfracture, or an early meningioma of the olfactory \ngroove.g\ng\t Other abnormalities of smell are hyperosmia and parosmia. Hyperosmia \nis an increase in the sensitivity of the sense of smell. It is often a sign of \npsychosis or hysteria but may occur with migraine, during menstruation \nand in cases of encephalitis. Parosmia is a perversion of the sense of \nsmell. It can occur following trauma to the head and in some psychoses. \nOlfactory hallucinations are more often than not a result of an organic \nlesion and suggest an irritating lesion in the olfactory cortex.\n",

      "text": "CHAPTER 32  The neurological examination: general signs and the cranial nerves \t\n505\nEXAMINING THE EYES\nDividing the ocular examination into individual cranial \nnerves is possible, but runs the risk of overlooking the \nmultiple problems causing impairment of function that \nare not a result of cranial nerve abnormalities. For \nexample, pathology can be:\n•\t\nintraocular\n•\t\nwithin muscles (such as in Graves’ ophthalmopathy)\n•\t\nat the neuromuscular junction (myasthenia gravis)\n•\t\nin the sympathetic chain (Horner’s syndrome)\n•\t\nin the supranuclear brainstem (progressive supra-\nnuclear palsy)\n•\t\nin a cerebral hemisphere (gaze palsy as a result of \na frontal stroke).\nFor this reason, while using the cranial nerves as a \nframework, it is important to realise that the eyes are a \n‘window to the brain’. The cranial nerves involved in the \nocular examination are:\nII Optic nerve (and retina)—visual information to the \nbrain\nIII Oculomotor nerve—most motor control, including \npupillary constriction and eyelid control\nIV Trochlear nerve—moves eye down and in, with \nintortion (twisting)\nVI Abducens nerve—moves the eye out (abducts the \neye as the name suggests)\nVIII Vestibular component of the vestibulocochlear \nnerve—provides eye stabilisation within the head during \nmovement and at rest\nV1 Ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve—sensa-\ntion over the cornea and eyelid\nVII Facial nerve—closes the eye.\nThe second (optic) nerve\nExamination anatomy\nThe optic nerve is not really a nerve but an extension \nof fibres of the central nervous system that unites the \nretinas with the brain. It is purely sensory, contains about \na million fibres and extends for about 5 centimetres (see \nFig. 32.5), passing through the optic foramen close to \nthe ophthalmic artery and joining the nerve from the \nother side at the base of the brain to form the optic \nchiasm. The spatial orientation of fibres from different \nparts of the fundus is preserved so that fibres from the \nlower part of the retina are found in the inferior part \nof the chiasm, and vice versa. Fibres from the temporal \nvisual fields (i.e. projecting to the nasal halves of the \nretinas) cross in the chiasm, whereas those from the \nnasal visual fields (projecting to the lateral halves of \nthe retinas) do not. Fibres for the light reflex from the \noptic chiasm finish in the superior colliculus, whence \nconnections occur with both third nerve nuclei. The \nremainder of the fibres leaving the chiasm are concerned \nwith vision and travel in the optic tract to the lateral \ngeniculate body. From here the fibres form the optic \nradiation and pass through the posterior part of the \ninternal capsule, finishing in the visual cortex of the \noccipital lobe. In their course they splay out so that \nfibres serving the lower quadrants course through the \nparietal lobe, and those for the upper quadrants traverse \nthe temporal lobe. The result of the decussation of \nfibres in the optic chiasm is that fibres from the left \nvisual field terminate in the right occipital lobe, and \nfibres from the right visual field terminate in the left \noccipital lobe.\nHistory\nThe majority of visual symptoms involve reduction \nin visual acuity. These are discussed in detail with the \nphysical examination findings. Some patients notice \na more specific change, which will help direct the \nexamination. Ask about the time course of the visual \ndisturbance and whether it seems to involve the vision \nof one eye or one visual field. Sudden loss of vision in \none eye (often described as an awareness of a curtain \nbeing drawn across the eye) may be due to an embolus \nto the retina. These are called negative visual symptoms. \nThere is usually, but not always, spontaneous return \nof vision. This is termed amaurosis fugax. Migraine \nattacks may be preceded by subjective visual changes, \nincluding scintillating scotomas, photophobia, blurred \nvision or hemianopia. Visual hallucinations such as \nflashing lights and distortions of vision are called positive \nvisual symptoms. They can also occur in migraine, \nretinal detachment or as the aura of an epileptic \nseizure.\n",

Use your right eye to look in the \npatient’s right eye, and vice versa. This prevents contact \nbetween the noses of the patient and the examiner in \nthe midline. Keep your head vertical so that the patient \ncan fix with the other eye.\nBegin with the ophthalmoscope on the +20 lens \nsetting, with the patient gazing into the distance. This \nprevents reflex pupil contraction, which occurs if the \npatient attempts to accommodate. Look first at the \ncornea and iris, and then at the lens. Large corneal \nulcers may be visible, as may undulation of the rim of \nthe iris, which is due to previous lens and lens capsule \nextraction and is called iridodonesis.k\nBy racking the ophthalmoscope down towards 0, \nthe focus can be shifted towards the fundus. Opacities \nin the lens (cataracts) may prevent inspection of the \nfundus. When the retina is in focus, search first for \nthe optic disc. This is done by following a large retinal \nvein back towards the disc. All these veins radiate from \nthe optic disc.\nThe margins of the disc must be examined with \ncare. The disc itself is usually a shallow cup with a \nclearly outlined rim. Loss of the normal depression of \nthe optic disc will cause blurring at the margins and \nis called papilloedema (see Fig. 32.10(a)). It indicates \nraised intracranial pressure. If papilloedema is suspected, \nthe retinal veins should be examined for spontaneous \npulsations. When these are present raised intracranial \npressure is excluded, but their absence does not prove \nthe pressure is raised.5 If the appearance of papilloedema \nis associated with demyelination in the anterior part \nof the optic nerve, it is called papillitis. These two can \nbe distinguished because papillitis causes visual loss \nbut papilloedema does not.\nNext note the colour of the optic disc. Normally, \nit is a rich yellow colour in contrast to the rest of the \nfundus, which is a rich red colour. The fundus may \nbe pigmented in some diseases and in patients with \npigmented skin. When the optic disc has a pale insipid \nwhite colour, optic atrophy is usually present (see \nFig. 32.10(b)).\nk\t Modern cataract surgery leaves the lens capsule in place so that iridodonesis \ndoes not occur. A pity in some ways since it is a very nice word.\nretina. The blind spot enlarges with \npapilloedema.\n•\t Central scotomata, or loss of central (macular) \nvision, may be due to demyelination of the optic \nnerve (multiple sclerosis causes unilateral or \nasymmetrical bilateral scotomata); toxic causes, \nsuch as methyl alcohol (symmetrical bilateral \nscotomata); nutritional causes, such as tobacco \nor alcohol amblyopia (symmetrical central or \ncentrocaecal scotomata); vascular lesions \n(unilateral); and gliomas of the optic nerve \n(unilateral).\n•\t Total unilateral visual loss is due to a lesion of the \noptic nerve or to unilateral eye disease.\n•\t Bitemporal hemianopia is due to a lesion that \naffects the centre of the optic chiasm, damaging \nfibres from the nasal halves of the retinas as they \ndecussate. This will result in loss of both \ntemporal halves of the visual fields. Causes \ninclude a pituitary tumour, a craniopharyngioma \nand a suprasellar meningioma.\n•\t Binasal hemianopia is very rare and is due to \nbilateral lesions affecting the uncrossed optic \nfibres, such as atheroma of the internal carotid \nsiphon.\n•\t Homonymous hemianopia is due to a lesion that \ndamages the optic tract or radiation, affecting the \nvisual field on the right or left side. For example, \nleft temporal and right nasal field loss will occur \nwith a right-sided lesion. The exact nature of the \ndefect depends on the site of interruption of the \nfibres. In the optic tract the defect is usually \ncomplete—there is no macular sparing. In the \nmore posterior optic radiation the macular vision \nis usually spared if the cause is ischaemia, but \nnot if a destructive process such as tumour or \nhaemorrhage is responsible. The macular cortical \narea is thought to have some additional blood \nsupply from the anterior and middle cerebral \narteries.\n•\t Homonymous quadrantanopia is loss of the upper \nor lower homonymous quadrants of the visual \nfields. This may be due to temporal lobe lesions \n(e.g. vascular lesions or tumours), which cause \nupper quadrantanopia, or parietal lobe lesions \n(e.g. vascular lesions or tumours), which cause \nlower quadrantanopia.\n",

The sympathetic innervation to the eye \n(stimulation causes pupillary dilation: mydriasis) is \nas follows: fibres from the hypothalamus go to the \nciliospinal centre in the spinal cord at C8, T1 and T2, \nwhere they synapse; from there second-order neurones \nexit via the anterior ramus in the thoracic trunk and \nsynapse in the superior cervical ganglion in the neck; \nthird-order neurones travel from here with the internal \ncarotid artery to the eye. In addition, the pupillary \nreflexes (see Fig. 32.11) depend for their afferent limb \non the optic nerve (see Fig. 32.5). Constriction of the \npupil in response to light is relayed by the optic nerve \nand tract to the superior colliculus and then to the \nEdinger–Westphal nucleus of the third nerve in the \nmidbrain (see Fig. 32.12).

This is called a relative afferent \npupillary defect (RAPD or the Marcus Gunnn pupillary \nsign). It occurs because an eye with even mildly reduced \nacuity has reduced afferent impulses so that the light \nreflex is decreased. When the light is shone from the \nnormal eye to the abnormal one the pupil dilates, as \nreflex pupillary constriction in the abnormal eye is so \nreduced that relaxation after the consensual response \ndominates.\nNow test accommodation. Ask the patient to look \ninto the distance and then to focus his or her eyes on \nan object such as a finger or a white-tipped hat-pin \nbrought to a point about 30 centimetres in front of the \nnose. There is normally constriction of both pupils—the \naccommodation response. It depends on a pathway \nfrom the visual association cortex descending to the \nthird nerve nucleus. Causes of an absent light reflex \nwith an intact accommodation reflex include a midbrain \nlesion (e.g. the Argyll Robertson pupil of syphilis), a \nciliary ganglion lesion (e.g. Adie’so pupil) and Parinaud’sp \nsyndrome (p 520). Failure of accommodation alone \nmay occur occasionally with a midbrain lesion or with \ncortical blindness.\nEye movements\nThere are four types of eye movements.\n1.\tPursuit eye movements: are used to follow a \nmoving object. Watching a person walk by \ninvolves pursuit.\n○\t Controlled by the cerebellum and brainstem.\n2.\tSaccadicq: are rapid movements from one point \nof fixation to another. Rapidly shifting gaze to \nsomeone calling out to you involves saccadic \nmovements.\n○\t Controlled from the frontal lobe, brainstem \nand cerebellum.\n3.\tConvergence movements: allow an object moving \ncloser to the face to be followed. Needed to read \na nearby book.\n○\t Controlled from the midbrain.\n4.\tVestibulo-ocular reflex movements: are used to \ncompensate for movements of the head and \nenable fixation to be maintained, e.g. keeping \nyour eyes on target while moving your head.\n○\t Controlled by vestibular organs and cerebellar \nand vestibular nuclei.\nThere are six eye muscles that move each eye, allowing \nhorizontal, vertical and torsional movements. The \nevolutionary reason for this is that the muscles parallel \nthe vestibular semicircular canals, with each muscle \nroughly in the plane of a vestibular canal. Fig. 32.13 \nillustrates the role for each muscle and its innervation. \nWhen any nerve fails (e.g. CN III) the eye movements \nof the affected eye are limited to those controlled by \nthe unaffected nerves.\nThe full examination of eye movements includes \nassessment for:\n•\t double vision (diplopia)\n•\t nystagmus (see below).\nEye movements and diplopia\nAsk the patient to look at the invaluable hat-pin.r Assess \nvoluntary (pursuit) eye movements in both eyes first. \nAsk the patient to look laterally right and then left, up \nand then down (see Fig. 32.14).

Diplopia \nthat persists when one eye is covered (mononuclear \ndiplopia) is uncommon.\nNystagmus\nThe eyes are normally maintained at rest in the midline \nby the balance of tone between opposing ocular muscles. \nDisturbance of this tone, which depends on impulses \nfrom the retina, the muscles of the eyes themselves \nand various vestibular and central connections, allows \nthe eyes to drift in one direction. This drift is corrected \nby a quick movement (saccadic) back to the original \nposition. When these movements occur repeatedly, \nnystagmus is said to be present (see List 32.1). The \ndirection of the nystagmus is defined as that of the \nmore apparent fast (correcting) movement, although \nit is the slow drift that is abnormal. Nystagmus from \nany cause tends to be accentuated by gaze in a direction \naway from the midline. In many instances nystagmus \nis not present when the eyes are at rest and is detected \nonly when the eyes are deviated (gaze-evoked \nnystagmus). At the extremes of gaze, fine nystagmus \nis normal (physiological). Therefore, test for nystagmus \nby asking the patient to follow your pin out to 30° \nfrom the central gaze position.\nTYPES OF NYSTAGMUS\n1.\t Physiological: (optokinetic nystagmus [OKN]) \nused to watch the scenery from a moving \ntrain\n2.\t Retinal: (pendular) due to inability of the eyes \nto fixate (seen in established blindness)\n3.\t Central: a result of abnormalities of cerebellar \nor vestibular connections\n4.\t Peripheral: a result of lesions of the eighth \nnerve or the vestibular system of the ear\nLIST 32.1 \nNystagmus may be jerky or pendular:\n•\t Jerky horizontal nystagmus may be due to:\n○\t a vestibular lesion (drift is always to the side \nof the lesion, and intensity increases as the eye \nis moved away from this side—Alexander’s \nlaw.t A torsional component may be present \nacutely.)\n○\t a cerebellar lesion (Can have a number of \npatterns.

Fatigability refers to a progressive drop in \nmuscle strength resulting from depletion of acetylcholine \n(the neurotransmitter) at the neuromuscular junction. \nWith sustained muscle activation the weakness will \nbecome evident and diplopia may occur. Typically this \nincreases as the patient attempts to hold the eye in the \nsame position. Ptosis also often occurs. Test for this \nby holding a target up, 30–40° above the neutral \nposition, and asking the patient to keep the gaze on \nthe spot for 20–30 seconds. Ask whether there is double \nvision and watch for ptosis. If this occurs, rest the eyes \nand repeat to see whether recovery occurs, followed \nagain by fatigue.\nSometimes there is ptosis or diplopia at rest, and \nthis can be improved in the clinic by the ice-pack or \nice-on-eyes test. Ask the patient to hold a glove \ncontaining ice with a little insulation (e.g. a thin cloth) \nover the eye, until it becomes uncomfortable. Resolution \nof diplopia or ptosis, followed by recurrence as the eye \nwarms, is strongly suggestive of myasthenia gravis.\nVestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)\nThe VOR is the fastest reflex in the body (8 milliseconds \nfrom signal to eye movement), and allows the eyes to \nstay on target when the head moves quickly. This \npowerful reflex can overcome voluntary deficits in \npursuit and saccades so, for patients unable to cooperate \nfor the testing of saccades, see whether they can fix on \nthe spot and move the head in the opposite direction. \nThis reflex can also drive eye movements in response \nto head movement in unconscious patients, though \nsome medications can cause the VOR to disappear.\nThe head impulse (thrust) test (HIT)v (Fig. 32.17) \nallows assessment of vestibular integrity. Although it \ncan be lost in brainstem lesions, it is typically present \nin a peripheral vestibular loss. The patient should watch \na target, typically between the examiner’s eyes, while \nthe head is gently moved back and forward. Inability \nto fix at low velocities suggests bilateral vestibular and \ncerebellar failure. However, at high velocities, eye \nmovements are driven by the VOR in isolation. Make \nfast, but small, turns of the head and watch the eyes. \nIf there is loss of vestibular function the eyes will move \nwith the head when turned towards the damaged side, \nand there will be a catch-up saccade back to the target.\nv\t Described by G Michael Halmagyi and Ian Curthoys, of the neurology \ndepartment, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney.\nFurther vestibular assessment is discussed below \nas part of the eighth cranial nerve assessment.\nFeatures of a third nerve lesion\nThese are complete ptosis (partial ptosis may occur \nwith an incomplete lesion), divergent strabismus (eye \n‘down and out’) and a dilated pupil that is unreactive \nboth to direct light (the consensual reaction in the \nopposite normal eye is intact) and to accommodation \n(see Fig. 32.18). Always try to exclude a fourth \n(trochlear) nerve lesion when a third nerve lesion is \npresent. One way to do this is by tilting the patient’s \nhead to the same side as the lesion. The affected eye \nwill intort if the fourth nerve is intact. (Remember \nSIN—the Superior oblique INtorts the eye.)\nAetiology of a third nerve palsy\nThird nerve lesions are most commonly related to \ntrauma or are idiopathic. Central causes include \nvascular lesions in the brainstem, tumours and, \nrarely, demyelination. Peripheral causes include: (1) \ncompressive lesions, such as an aneurysm (usually on \nthe posterior communicating artery), tumour, basal \nmeningitis, nasopharyngeal carcinoma or orbital \nlesions—for example, Tolosa–Hunt syndrome (superior \norbital fissure syndrome—painful lesions of III, IV, \nVI and the first division of V), and (2) ischaemia or \ninfarction, as in arteritis, diabetes mellitus and migraine.\nFeatures of a fourth nerve lesion\nTest this nerve by asking the patient to turn the eye in \nand then try to look down: a lesion results in paralysis \nof the superior oblique with weakness of downward \n(and outward) movement. The patient may walk around \nwith his or her head tilted away from the lesion—that \nis, to the opposite shoulder (this allows the patient to \nmaintain binocular vision).\nAn isolated fourth nerve palsy is rare and is usually \nidiopathic or related to trauma. It may occasionally \noccur with lesions of the cerebral peduncle.\nFeatures of a sixth nerve lesion\nThese are failure of lateral movement, convergent \nstrabismus and diplopia.

VOR eye movements \non neck flexion and extension are preserved until late \nin the course of the disease.\nParinaud’s syndrome is loss of vertical gaze often \nassociated with nystagmus on attempted convergence \n(see below). There are pseudo-Argyll Robertson pupils. \nThe causes of Parinaud’s syndrome include a pinealoma, \nmultiple sclerosis and vascular lesions.\nInvoluntary upward deviation of the eyes (oculogyric \ncrisis) occurs with postencephalitic Parkinson’s disease \nand may be seen in patients sensitive to phenothiazine \nderivatives or in patients on levodopa therapy.\nOne-and-a-half syndrome is rare but important \nto recognise. These patients have a horizontal gaze palsy \nwhen looking to one side (the ‘one’) plus impaired \nadduction on looking to the other side (the ‘and-a-half’). \nOther features often include turning out (exotropia) \nof the eye opposite the side of the lesion (paralytic \n",

Here, stimulation or irritation \nof the nasal mucosa with a hair or small piece of string is followed by \ncontraction of the muscles of the nasopharynx and thorax. The afferent \nlimb of this arc is through the trigeminal nerve and the efferent limb \nthrough the facial, glossopharyngeal, vagus and trigeminal nerves, and \nthe motor nerves of the cervical spine.

Begin \nby inspecting for wasting of the temporal and masseter \nmuscles. Ask the patient to clench the teeth, then palpate \nfor contraction of the masseter above the mandible \n(see Fig. 32.25). The strength of these muscles can be \ntested by asking the patient to bite forcefully onto a \nwooden tongue depressor with the molar teeth. The \ndepth of the teeth marks on each side gives an indication \nof the relative strength of the muscles. You can attempt \nto withdraw the tongue depressor as the patient bites \nit. A bite of normal strength will prevent this. Then \nget the patient to hold open the mouth (pterygoid \nmuscles) while you attempt to force it shut. A unilateral \nlesion of the motor division causes the jaw to deviate \ntowards the weak (affected) side.\nTest the jaw jerk or masseter reflex. Ask the patient \nto let the mouth fall open slightly; place your finger \non the tip of the jaw and tap it lightly with a tendon \nhammer (see Fig. 32.26).

He or she may \nbe aware of dryness of the eyes (decreased lacrimation) \nor the mouth (decreased salivary production). Paralysis \nof the stapedius muscle can cause hyperacusis or \nintolerance of loud or high-pitched sounds. Normal \ncontraction of the stapedius muscle occurs in response \nto loud rebarbative noises such as popular music and \ndampens movement of the ossicles.\nExamination\nInspect for facial asymmetry, as a seventh nerve palsy \ncan cause unilateral drooping of the corner of the \nmouth, and smoothing of the wrinkled forehead and \nthe nasolabial fold (see Fig. 32.29).

The \ncommoner type of BPPV results from otoconia in the \nposterior semicircular canal and is associated with \nupbeating—torsional nystagmus that beats towards \nthe ground (geotropic). In the rarer horizontal canal \nBPPV, nystamus is horizontal and occurs on both sides \nwith the Dix–Hallpike manoeuvre, but is worse on the \naffected side.\nIf there is no latent period, no waxing and waning \nor the nystagmus persists or is variable, this suggests \nthat there may be a lesion of the brainstem (e.g. multiple \nsclerosis) or the cerebellum (e.g. metastatic carcinoma). \nMore rarely there may be cupulolithiasis—otoconia \nstuck to the vestibular sensory organ.\nCauses of vestibular abnormalities\nPeripheral causes include:\n•\t acute labyrinthitis, vestibular neuritis\n•\t trauma.\nIn the brainstem:\n•\t migraine\n•\t vascular lesions\n•\t tumours of the cerebellum or fourth ventricle\n•\t demyelination.\nVertigo may be associated with temporal lobe \ndysfunction including:\n•\t ischaemia\n•\t complex partial seizures.\nExamination of the ear and hearing\nLook to see whether the patient is wearing a hearing \naid; if so, remove it. Examine the pinna and look for \nscars behind the ears. Pull on the pinna gently (it is \ntender if the patient has external ear disease or \ntemporomandibular joint disease). Feel for nodes \n(pre- and postauricular) that may indicate disease of \nthe external auditory meatus.\nInspect the patient’s external auditory meatus. The \nadult canal angulates, so in order to see the eardrum \nit is necessary to pull up and backwards on the auricle \nbefore inserting the otoscope. The normal eardrum \n(tympanic membrane) is pearly grey and concave. Look \nfor wax or other obstructions, and inspect the eardrum \nfor inflammation or perforation (see Ch 42).\nNext, test hearing. A simple test involves covering \nthe opposite auditory meatus with a finger, and moving \nit about as a distraction while whispering a number \nin the other ear. This should be standardised by the \nuse of set numbers for different tones. For example, \nthe number 68 is used to test high tone and 100 is used \nto test low tone. Whispering should be performed \ntowards the end of expiration in an attempt to \nstandardise the volume and at about 60 centimetres \nfrom the patient’s ear. Your larynx should not vibrate \nif the whispering is soft enough. If partial deafness is \nsuspected, know how to perform Rinné’s and Weber’s \ntests:\n•\t Rinné’sii test—a 512 or 256 Hz vibrating tuning \nfork is placed on the mastoid process, behind the \near, and when the sound is no longer heard it is \nplaced in line with the external meatus (see Fig. \n32.36). Normally the note is audible at the \nexternal meatus. If the patient has nerve \ndeafness, the note is audible at the external \nmeatus, as air and bone conduction are reduced \nequally, so that air conduction is better (as is \nnormal). This is termed Rinné-positive. If there \nis a conduction (middle-ear) deafness, no note is \naudible at the external meatus. This is termed \nRinné negative.\n•\t Weber’sjj test—a vibrating 256 or 512 Hz tuning \nfork is positioned on the centre of the forehead \n(see Fig. 32.37). Normally the sound is heard in \nthe centre of the forehead. Nerve deafness causes \nthe sound to be heard better in the normal ear. A \npatient with conduction deafness finds the sound \nlouder in the abnormal ear.\n",

The patient experiences sudden shooting \npains that radiate from one side of the throat to the ear. \nThere may be trigger areas in the throat and attacks \ncan be brought on by chewing or swallowing.\nUnilateral vagus nerve paralysis may cause difficulty \nin initiating the swallowing of solids and liquids, and \nhoarseness.\nExamination\nAsk the patient to open the mouth and inspect the \npalate with a torch. Note any displacement of the \nuvula. Then ask the patient to say ‘Ah!’ (see Fig. 32.40). \nNormally, the posterior edge of the soft palate—the \nvelumaa—rises symmetrically. If the uvula is drawn to \none side this indicates a unilateral tenth nerve palsy. \nNote that the uvula is drawn towards the normal \nside.kk\nTesting for the gag reflex (CN IX is the sensory \ncomponent and X the motor component) is traditional \nbut not necessary.7 A better alternative is to touch the \nback of the pharynx on each side (rather than the soft \npalate) with a spatula. The patient is asked whether \nthe touch of the spatula (ninth) is felt each time. \nNormally, there is reflex contraction of the soft palate. \nCranial nerve X: ‘Say “Ah” ’—look for \nasymmetrical movement of the uvula \nFIGURE 32.40 \nkk\t Velum means ‘curtain’ in Latin.\nIf contraction is absent and sensation is intact, this \nsuggests a tenth nerve palsy. The most common cause \nof a reduced gag reflex is old age. Of more concern \nis the patient with an exaggerated but still normal \nreflex: this can lead to vomiting onto the examining \nclinician.\nAsk the patient to speak in order to assess hoarseness \n(which may occur with a unilateral recurrent laryngeal \nnerve lesion), and then to cough. Listen for the \ncharacteristic bovine cough that occurs with recurrent \nlaryngeal nerve lesions. It is not necessary routinely \nto test taste on the posterior third of the tongue (ninth \nnerve). A high-pitched ‘eeee’ sound is also a good test \nfor vocal cord function.\nTest the patient’s ability to swallow a small amount \nof water and watch for regurgitation into the nose, or \ncoughing. If bulbar function is obviously impaired, \nomit this step.\nCauses of a ninth (glossopharyngeal) \nand tenth (vagus) nerve palsy\nCentral causes are vascular lesions (e.g. lateral medullary \ninfarction, due to vertebral or posterior inferior \ncerebellar artery disease), tumours, syringobulbia and \nmotor neurone disease. Peripheral (posterior fossa) \nlesions comprise aneurysms at the base of the skull, \ntumours, chronic meningitis or the Guillain–Barré \nsyndrome.\nThe eleventh (accessory) \nnerve\nExamination anatomy\nThe central portion of this nerve arises in the medulla \nclose to the nuclei of the ninth, tenth and twelfth nerves \nand its spinal portion arises from the upper five cervical \nsegments. It leaves the skull with the ninth and tenth \nnerves through the jugular foramen (see Fig. 32.39). \nIts central division provides motor fibres to the vagus \nand the spinal division innervates the trapezius and \nthe sternocleidomastoid muscles. The motor fibres that \nsupply the sternocleidomastoid muscle are thought to \ncross twice so that cortical control of the muscle is \nipsilateral. This makes sense when one remembers that \nthe muscle turns the head to the opposite side. This \nmeans that the hemisphere that receives information \nfrom and controls one side of the body also turns the \nhead to face that side.\n",

Ask the patient to hold his or her breath each \ntime. Bruits heard over the skull may be due to an \narteriovenous malformation, advanced Paget’s disease \nor a vascular meningioma, or they may be conducted \nfrom the carotids.\nCarotid bruits\nExamination anatomy\nThe left common carotid artery arises directly from \nthe aorta and the right arises from the brachiocephalic \nartery, which is the first branch of the aortic arch. The \ncommon carotids run up from the level of the \nsternoclavicular joint and back through the neck to \ndivide at the level of the upper border of the thyroid \ncartilage into the external and internal carotids. The \nexternal carotids continue to the parotid glands where \nthey terminate and branch into the superficial temporal \nand mandibular arteries. The internal carotid climbs \nto the base of the skull and enters it via the carotid \ncanal in the temporal bone (see Fig. 32.46).\nIt is traditional to listen for carotid bruits with the \nbell of the stethoscope placed somewhere between the \nangle of the jaw and the upper end of the thyroid \ncartilage, but no method has been shown to be better \nthan any other.\nCarotid bruits are common, being found in 20% \nof children and 1% of adults. They are more common \nin patients with increased cardiac output (anaemia, \nthyrotoxicosis and haemodialysis fistula). They must \nbe distinguished from the conducted murmur of aortic \nstenosis (louder over the praecordium) and from venous \nhums (diastolic component and abolished by gentle \npressure on the neck above the stethoscope).\nThe significance of a bruit is its association \nwith carotid artery stenosis and stroke. The LR+ \nfor significant carotid stenosis (70–99% stenosis by \nDoppler ultrasound) is about 4.8 In symptomatic \npatients (ipsilateral previous transient ischaemic attack \nor stroke) a bruit predicts significant stenosis with a \nvery similar LR+. The absence of a bruit does not rule \nout a significant lesion.\nThere is general agreement that the presence of a \nbruit indicates an increased risk of atherosclerotic \ndisease and in younger patients (<75), at least, an \nincrease in risk of stroke to an annual incidence of \n1–3%.9 However, as the correct treatment of these \npatients has not been established, various groups have \nrecommended that asymptomatic patients should not \nbe examined for the presence of a carotid bruit lest its \ndiscovery cause unnecessary alarm and tests.10\n",

If the nature of the abnormality is not \nobvious, before going on to the compartmentalised tests \nbelow, first ask the patient to talk freely—propositional \nor free speech. In a normal clinical encounter this will \nhave already come from history taking. However, at \ntimes when the clinical interaction is difficult it is worth \nmoving to an early examination of language before \nproceeding. In viva voce examinations or OSCEs, a \nstructured approach is essential to ensure you can \nidentify the problem correctly.\nDysphasia\nDysphasia is often described as expressive or receptive, \nthough it can also be characterised as fluent or \nnon-fluent.a Although the cardinal types of dysphasia \nare listed below, often features are mixed, which is why \na structured approach to examining speech is important \n(List 33.1). Non-fluent aphasia is slow, effortful and \noften has significant patient frustration (imagine trying \nto communicate with only a rudimentary knowledge \nof English). Words are often nouns or verbs, though \nthere may be paraphasic errors. In contrast, fluent \naphasia is often flowing with frequent errors and content \nis often poor. Patients with fluent aphasia are often \nmistakenly thought to be simply confused, once again \ndemonstrating the importance of structured language \nassessment.1\n1.\tReceptive (posterior) dysphasia. This is where \nthe patient cannot understand the spoken word \n(auditory dysphasia) or the written word (alexia). \nThis condition is suggested when the patient is \nunable to understand any commands or \nquestions, or to recognise written words in the \nabsence of deafness or blindness. Speech is fluent \nbut disorganised. It occurs with a lesion \n(infarction, haemorrhage or space-occupying \ntumour) in the dominant hemisphere in the \nposterior part of the first temporal gyrus \n(Wernicke’sb area).\n2.\tExpressive (anterior) dysphasia. This is present \nwhen the patient understands, but cannot answer \na\t The terms dysphasia and aphasia are sometimes used synonymously but \naphasia really means a complete absence of speech.\nb\t Karl Wernicke (1848–1904), a professor of neurology at Breslau, described \nreceptive aphasia in 1874. He was killed while riding his bicycle.\nCLASSIFICATION OF DYPHASIAS\n1.\t Expressive dysphasia = Broca’s \ndysphasia = motor dysphasia = typically \nnon-fluent\n2.\t Receptive dysphasia = Wernicke’s \ndysphasia = sensory dysphasia = typically fluent\n3.\t Nominal dysphasia = dysnomic dysphasia\nLIST 33.1 \n",

He described muscular dystrophy before Duchenne.\nappropriately. Speech is non-fluent. This occurs \nwith a lesion in the posterior part of the \ndominant third frontal gyrus (Broca’sc area). \nCertain types of speech may be retained by these \npatients. These include automatic speech: the \npatient may be able to recite word series such as \nthe days of the week or letters of the alphabet. \nSometimes emotional speech may be preserved so \nthat when frustrated or upset the patient may be \nable to swear fluently. In the same way the \npatient may be able to sing familiar songs while \nbeing unable to speak the words. It is important \nto remember that unless the lesion responsible \nfor these defects is very large there may be no \nreduction in the patient’s higher intellectual \nfunctions, memory or judgement. Some patients \nmay incorrectly be considered as psychotic \nbecause of their disorganised speech.\n3.\tNominal dysphasia. All types of dysphasia may \ncause difficulty in naming objects. There is also a \nspecific type of nominal dysphasia, whereby \nobjects cannot be named (e.g. the nib of a pen) but \nother aspects of speech are normal. The patient \nmay use long sentences to overcome failure to find \nthe correct word (circumlocution). It occurs with \na lesion of the dominant posterior \ntemporoparietal area. Other causes include \nencephalopathy or the intracranial pressure effects \nof a distinct space-occupying lesion; it may also \noccur in the recovery phase from any dysphasia. \nIts localising value is therefore doubtful.\n4.\tConductive dysphasia. This is present when the \npatient repeats statements and names objects \npoorly, but can follow commands. It is thought \nto be caused by a lesion of the arcuate fasciculus \nand / or other fibres linking Wernicke’s and \nBroca’s areas.\nExamination of speech (List 33.2)\nFirst assess comprehension. If the patient cannot \nunderstand you, then further examination is near \nimpossible! Ensure that you (or relatives) do not give \nthe patient cues with body language. Start with a simple \ncommand—‘Close your eyes’. Give another simple \ncommand—‘Show me your tongue’. Then increase the \ndifficulty, for example ‘Touch your right ear with your \nleft hand’ (also tests for left–right agnosia), ‘Touch your \nnose, then your chin, then your forehead’ and ‘Point \nto the ceiling after you point to the floor’ (stress after).\nNext test repetition. Start simple and increase \ncomplexity as in every step. ‘Blue sky’ and ‘green grass’ \nare useful starting points. ‘Hippopotamus’ is an early \nscreen for dysarthria.

A hand has many layers of \ncomplexity from ‘hand’ to ‘thumb’ to ‘ring finger’ (ask \nwhich one—which also helps with finger agnosia) to \n‘knuckles’. Similarly a ‘shirt’ also has a ‘collar’, ‘sleeve’ \nand ‘cuff’ in order of difficulty.\nFinally, free speech can be tested (if this has not \nalready been done—see above). This can be remarkably \ndifficult in an exam situation. Asking the patient to \ndescribe you is fraught with danger. The exam room \nis often small, featureless and drab. Asking about \nhobbies may reveal very brief answers such as ‘I like \nfooty’. Instead, it is often good to have a detailed image \nto show the patient, and ask him or her to describe it \n(see Fig. 33.1). This allows assessment of fluency of \nspeech, as well as giving initial insight into visual \nfunction. Alternatively, the patient can be asked about \na day-to-day task such as ‘Explain the steps in getting \ndressed’. This helps assess planning.\nInterpretation of the findings\nIf the patient’s speech is fluent, but conveys information \nwith paraphasic errors, such as ‘treen’ for ‘train’ (i.e. \nusing a word of similar sound or spelling to the one \nintended),d the main possibilities are nominal, receptive \nand conductive dysphasia. Test for these by asking the \npatient to name an object, repeat a statement after you \nand then follow commands. If these are abnormal, ask \nthe patient to read and write, but remember that some \npatients may be illiterate.\nIf the speech is slow, hesitant and non-fluent, \nexpressive dysphasia is more likely and exactly the same \nprocedure is followed. It is important to note that many \ndysphasias will have mixed elements. Large lesions in \nthe dominant hemisphere may cause global dysphasia.\nDysprosody is the loss of the normal ups and downs \nin speech, without a change in the content from a \nnon-dominant hemisphere lesion. This is not dysphasia, \nbut may be noticed while examining speech carefully.\nDysarthria\nHere there is no disorder of the content of speech but \na difficulty with articulation.

The cause is infarction in both \ninternal capsules. This causes interruption of the \ndescending pyramidal tracts to the brainstem motor \nnuclei. The jaw jerk is usually increased. These patients \ntend to be very emotional and laugh and cry inappropriately. \nTheir facial expressions become very animated at these \ntimes in contrast to their inability to control their facial \nexpressions voluntarily.e This phenomenon occurs \nbecause the nuclei that control motor responses to \nemotion do not reside in the motor cortex.\nPatients who have bilateral lesions of the ninth and \ntenth cranial nerves are at risk of aspirating fluids or \nsolids into their lungs if they try to eat or drink. Certain \nbedside tests can be performed to see whether it is safe \nfor them to eat or drink. These traditionally include \ntesting the level of consciousness, the gag reflex, \npharyngeal sensation and swallowing water. The \nwater-swallowing test involves asking the patient to \nsip 5–10 mL of water repeatedly. Coughing or choking \nmakes the test positive.\nBulbar palsies cause a nasal speech, whereas facial \nmuscle weakness causes slurred speech. Extrapyramidal \ndisease can be responsible for monotonous speech, as \nit causes bradykinesia and muscular rigidity. Other \ncauses of dysarthria include alcohol intoxication and \ncerebellar disease. These result in loss of coordination \nand slow, slurred and often explosive speech, or speech \nbroken up into syllables, called scanning speech.\nMouth ulceration or disease may occasionally mimic \ndysarthria. Each of these causes must be considered \nand examined for as appropriate.\nDysphonia\nThis is alteration of the sound of the voice, such as \nhuskiness of the voice with decreased volume. It may \nbe due to laryngeal disease (e.g. following a viral \ninfection or a tumour of the vocal cord) or to recurrent \nlaryngeal nerve palsy.\nTHE CEREBRAL \nHEMISPHERES\nParietal, temporal and frontal lobe functions are tested \nif the patient is disoriented or has dysphasia, or if \ncognitive decline (dementia) is suspected. If the patient \nhas a receptive aphasia, however, these tests cannot be \nperformed. Their examination is otherwise not routine \n(see List 33.3).\nParietal lobe function\nThe parietal lobe is concerned with the reception and \nanalysis of sensory information.\nDominant lobe signs\nA lesion of the dominant parietal lobe in the angular \ngyrus causes a distinct clinical syndrome called \nGerstmann’sf syndrome. Test for this in the following \nmanner.\n1.\tAsk the patient to perform simple arithmetical \ncalculations—for example, serial 7s (take 7 from \n100, then 7 from the answer, and so on). The \ninability to do this with at least partial accuracy \nis called acalculia.\n2.\tAsk the patient to write—inability is called \nagraphia.\n3.\tTest for left–right disorientation by asking the \npatient to show you his or her right and then left \nhand. If this is correctly performed, ask the \npatient to touch his or her left ear with the right \nhand and vice versa. Inability to do this is called \nleft–right disorientation.\n4.\tAsk the patient to name his or her fingers— \ninability to do this is called finger agnosia. This \ninability may extend to identification of the \nexaminer’s fingers. The agnosias are receptive \ndefects involving the inability to understand the \nmeaning of stimulations of different types.\nA mnemonic for these four dominant parietal lobe \nsigns is AALF:\n",

A parietal \nlobe lesion results in astereognosis on the \nopposite side.\n•\t Agraphaesthesia may also be present; this is the \ninability to appreciate a number drawn on the \nhand on the opposite side to a parietal lesion \n(see Fig. 33.2).\n•\t Two-point discrimination testing involves the \nability to distinguish a single point from two \npoints close together (see Fig. 33.3).

Ask the patient to shut the eyes \nand then say whether one or two points can be \nfelt. Bring the compass points closer together and \ntest intermittently with just one point.\n•\t Examine for dressing and constructional apraxia. \nDressing apraxia is tested by taking the patient’s \npyjama top or cardigan, turning it inside out and \nasking him or her to put it back on. Patients with \na non-dominant parietal lobe lesion may find \nthis impossible to do. Constructional apraxia is \ntested by asking the patient to copy an object \nthat you have drawn (e.g. a tree or a house—see \nFig. 33.4(a) and (b)).\n•\t Next test spatial neglect by asking the patient to \nfill in the numbers on an empty clock face (see \nFig. 33.4(c)). Patients with a right parietal lesion \nmay fill in numbers only on the left side (the \nother side of the clock face is ignored). Spatial \nneglect also occurs with dominant parietal lobe \nlesions, but is less common.\nTemporal lobe function\nThis lobe is concerned with short-term and long-term \nmemory. Test short-term memory by the name, address, \nflower test—ask the patient to remember a name, \naddress and the names of three flowers, and repeat \nthem immediately. Then ask the patient 5 minutes later \nto repeat the names again. Test long-term memory by \nasking, for example, what year World War II ended. \nMemory may be impaired in dementia from any cause.\nAn alert patient with a severe memory disturbance \nmay make up stories to fill any gaps in his or her \nmemory. This is called confabulation and is typical of \nthe syndrome of Korsakoff’sg psychosis (amnesic \ndementia). Confabulation can be tested by asking the \npatient whether he or she has met you before. However, \nbe prepared for the very long, detailed and completely \nfalse story that may follow.\nKorsakoff’s psychosis occurs most commonly in \nalcoholics owing to thiamine deficiency (where there \nis loss of nerve cells in the thalamic nuclei and \nmammillary bodies), and rarely with thalamic stroke, \nhead injury, tumour, anoxic encephalopathy or \nencephalitis.

Sensory symptoms include pain, numbness \nand paraesthesias (tingling or pins and needles). It is \nimportant to find out whether there is involvement of \nmore than one modality, something the patient may \nnot have noticed. The distribution, time of onset and \nduration may give clues to the aetiology of the symptoms \nor at least as to where the sensory examination should \nbe concentrated.\nQUESTIONS BOX 34.1 \nQUESTIONS TO ASK THE PATIENT WITH MUSCLE WEAKNESS\n1.\t Have you felt weakness on both sides of the body? (Suggests spinal cord disease, myopathy or \nmyasthenia gravis)\n2.\t Is the weakness just on one side of the body or face? (Transient ischaemic attack or stroke)\n3.\t Has the weakness affected just an arm or a leg or part of a limb? (Peripheral neuropathy or \nradiculopathy, stroke or multiple sclerosis)\n4.\t Have you had trouble getting up from a chair, brushing your hair or lifting your head?

It is usually \nbenign if not associated with other signs of a motor \nlesion.\nTone\nTone is tested at both the wrists and the elbows. Rotation \nof the wrists with supination and pronation of the elbow \njoints (supporting the patient’s elbow with one hand \nand holding the hand with the other) is performed \npassively (the examiner does the work), and the patient \nshould be told to relax to allow you to move the joints \nfreely.\nWhen you raise and then drop the patient’s arm, \nit will fall suddenly if tone is reduced. With experience \nit is possible to decide whether tone is normal or \nincreased (hypertonic, as in an upper motor neurone \nor extrapyramidal lesion). Hypotonia is a difficult \nclinical sign to elicit and probably not helpful in the \nassessment of a lower motor neurone lesion. Most \nelderly people find it difficult not to try to help you \nand to relax their muscles completely. This leads to \nan increase in tone in all directions of movement, which \nincreases with the speed of movement and with \nencouragement to relax. This is called gegenhaltec or \nparatonia. When it is severe it may be a result of frontal \nlobe or diffuse cerebrovascular disease. If the joints \nare moved unpredictably and at different rates or if \nthe patient is distracted (e.g. by being asked to count \nbackwards from 100) it may be reduced. Young people \nwho are able to relax their muscle completely have \nlittle or no tone and hypotonia cannot be diagnosed \nin these people.\nThe cogwheel rigidity of Parkinson’s disease is \nanother abnormality of tone in the upper limbs. It is \nbest assessed by having the patient move the other arm \nup and down as you move the hand and forearm, testing \ntone at the wrist and elbow. It is the result of rigidity \nand superimposed tremor.\nMyotonia as described above is also an abnormality \nof tone that is worse after active movement. In these \npatients, tone is usually normal at rest but after sudden \nmovements there may be a great increase in tone and \nthe patient is unable to relax the muscle. Tapping over \nthe body of a myotonic muscle causes a dimple of \ncontraction, which only slowly disappears (percussion \nmyotonia). This is best tested by tapping the thenar \nneutral position). There are only three causes of arm \ndrift:\n1.\tUpper motor neurone (pyramidal) weakness: the \ndrift of the affected limb(s) here is due to muscle \nweakness and tends to be in a downward \ndirection. The drifting typically starts distally \nwith the fingers and spreads proximally. There \nmay be slow pronation of the wrist and flexion of \nthe fingers and elbow.\n2.\tCerebellar disease: the drift here is usually \nupwards. It also includes slow pronation of the \nwrist and elbow.\n3.\tLoss of proprioception: the drift here \n(pseudoathetosis) is really a searching movement \nand usually affects only the fingers. It is due to \nloss of joint position sense and can be in any \ndirection.\nFasciculations\nAsk the patient to relax the arms and rest them on his or \nher lap. Inspect the large muscle groups for fasciculations \n(see List 34.1). These are irregular contractions of \nsmall areas of muscle that have no rhythmical pattern. \nFasciculation may be coarse or fine and is present at \nrest, but not during voluntary movement.b If present \nwith weakness and wasting, fasciculation indicates \nCAUSES (DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS) OF \nFASCICULATIONS\nMotor neurone disease\nMotor root compression\nPeripheral neuropathy (e.g. diabetic)\nPrimary myopathy\nThyrotoxicosis\nNote: Myokymia resembles coarse fasciculation of the same \nmuscle group and is particularly common in the orbicularis \noculi muscles, where it is usually benign. Focal myokymia, \nhowever, often represents brainstem disease (e.g. multiple \nsclerosis or glioma).\nFibrillation is seen only on the electromyogram.\nLIST 34.1 \nb\t If no fasciculation is seen, tapping over the bulk of the brachioradialis \nand biceps muscles with the finger or with a tendon hammer and watching \nagain has been recommended, but this is controversial. Most neurologists \ndo not do this. The reason is that fasciculations are spontaneous. Any \nmuscle movement from a local stimulus is not spontaneous. Even if they \noccur, they may have nothing to do with fasciculations.\nc\t From the German meaning ‘counterpressure’ or ‘standing your ground’.\n",

Practice will help you \ndecide whether the response is within the normal range. \nWhen a reflex is greatly exaggerated, it can be elicited \naway from the usual zone.\nIf a reflex appears to be absent, always test following \na reinforcement manoeuvre. For example, ask the patient \nto clench the teeth tightly just before you let the hammer \nfall. Various mechanisms have been identified to explain \nreinforcement, but it works partly as a distraction, \nespecially if the reflex is absent, because an anxious \npatient has contracted opposing muscle groups. Merely \ntalking to the patient may provide enough distraction \nfor the reflex to be elicited. Sometimes normal reflexes \ncan be elicited only after reinforcement, but they should \nstill be symmetrical.\nAn increased jerk occurs with an upper motor \nneurone lesion.

Clinical neuroanatomy for \nmedical students, 4th edition. Lippincott-Raven. 1997.)\nFIGURE 34.18 \ni\t\nIn 1826 Sir Charles Bell recognised that there was a ‘sixth sense’, which \nwas later called proprioception. Vibration sense had been recognised in \nthe 16th century and tests for it were developed in the 19th century by \nRinné and others. Rydel and Seiffer found that vibration sense and \nproprioception were carried in the posterior columns of the spinal cord.\nright with left in the same dermatome. Map out the \nextent of any area of dullness. Always do this by going \nfrom the area of dullness to the area of normal sensation \n(hence distal to proximal in most neuropathies).\nTemperature testing\nCold sensation can be tested with a metal object, such \nas a tuning fork or metal end of the tendon hammer. \nAbsence of ability to feel heat is almost always associated \nwith inability to feel cold. Start distally and rapidly \nmove proximally asking whether the temperature \nchanges. Temperature sensation testing is often better \ntolerated by patients than pain sensation testing and \nneurologists consider it more helpful—though they \nmay go on to do this to confirm temperature findings.\nPosterior columns (vibration and \nproprioceptioni)\nThese fibres enter and ascend ipsilaterally in the \nposterior columns of the spinal cord to the nucleus \ngracilis and nucleus cuneatus in the medulla, where \nthey decussate (see Fig. 34.18).\nVibration testing\nUse a 128 Hz (not a 256 Hz) tuning fork. Ask the patient \nto close the eyes, and place the vibrating tuning fork \non one of the distal interphalangeal joints. Patients \nwho have no experience with testing may let out a \nsurprised exclamation. This confirms normal vibration \nsensation in that hand. The patient may describe a \nfeeling of vibration, buzzing or may even gesture with \ntheir hands. Deaden the tuning fork with your hand; \nthe patient should be able to say exactly when this \noccurs. Compare one side with the other. If vibration \nsense is reduced or absent, test over the ulnar head at \nthe wrist, then the elbows (over the olecranon) and \nthen the shoulders to determine the level of abnormality. \nAlthough the tuning fork is traditionally placed only \nover bony prominences, vibration sense is just as good \nover soft tissues.\nProprioception testing\nUse the distal interphalangeal joint of the patient’s little \nfinger. When the patient has his or her eyes open, grasp \nthe distal phalanx from the sides (not the top and \nbottom) and move it up and down to demonstrate \nthese positions. Start with big movements so the patient \ngets the idea, and progress to smaller movements. Then \nask the patient to close the eyes while these manoeuvres \nare repeated randomly. Normally, movement through \neven a few degrees is detectable, and should be reported \n",

As a rule, sense of \nposition is lost before sense of movement, and the little \nfinger is affected before the thumb.\nLight-touch testing\nSome fibres travel in the posterior columns (i.e. \nipsilaterally) and the rest cross the middle line to travel \nin the anterior spinothalamic tract (i.e. contralaterally). \nFor this reason, light touch is of the least discriminating \nvalue. It is often omitted, except for bilateral touching \nwith the fingers to assess for inattention or neglect (Ch \n33). Irritation of light-touch receptors is probably \nresponsible for paraesthesias—for example, following \nischaemia of a limb.\nTest light touch by touching the skin with a wisp \nof cottonwool. Ask the patient to shut the eyes and say \n‘yes’ when the touch is felt. Do not stroke the skin \nbecause this moves hair fibres. Test each dermatome,j \ncomparing left and right sides.\nInterpretation of sensory abnormalities\nTry to fit the distribution of any sensory loss into a \ndermatome (due to a spinal cord or nerve root lesion), \na single peripheral nerve territory, a peripheral \nneuropathy pattern (glove distribution, p 583) or a \nhemisensory loss (due to spinal cord or upper brainstem \nor thalamic lesion).\nSensory dermatomes of the upper limb (see Fig. \n34.19) can be recognised by memorising the following \nrough guide:\n•\t C5 supplies the shoulder tip and outer part of \nthe upper arm.\n•\t C6 supplies the lateral aspect of the forearm and \nthumb.\n•\t C7 supplies the middle finger.\n•\t C8 supplies the little finger.\n•\t T1 supplies the medial aspect of the upper arm \nand the elbow.\nExamination of the peripheral nerves of \nthe upper limb\nA lesion of a peripheral nerve causes a characteristic \nmotor and sensory loss.3 Peripheral nerve lesions may \nj\t\nThe human dermatomes (which he called pain spots) were first mapped \nby Sir Henry Head (1861–1940).

This enabled him to chart the order of \nreturn of the sensory modalities.\nhave local causes, such as trauma or compression, or \nmay be part of a mononeuritis multiplex, where more \nthan one nerve is affected by systemic disease.\nThe radial nerve (C5–C8)\nThis is the motor nerve supplying the triceps and \nbrachioradialis and the extensor muscles of the hand. \nThe characteristic deformity that results from radial \nnerve injury is wrist drop (see Fig. 34.20). To demonstrate \nthis, if it is not already obvious, get the patient to flex \nthe elbow, pronate the forearm and extend the wrist \nand fingers. If a lesion occurs above the upper third of \nthe upper arm, the triceps muscle is also affected. \nTherefore, test elbow extension, which will be absent if \nthe lesion is high.\nTest sensation using a pin over the area of the \nanatomical snuff box. Sensation here is lost with a radial \nnerve lesion before the bifurcation into posterior \ninterosseous and superficial radial nerves at the elbow \n(see Fig. 34.21).\nThe median nerve (C6–T1)\nThis nerve contains the motor supply to all the muscles \non the front of the forearm except the flexor carpi \nulnaris and the ulnar half of the flexor digitorum \nprofundus. It also supplies the following short muscles \nof the hand—LOAF:\nL\t ateral two lumbricals\nO\tpponens pollicis\nA\tbductor pollicis brevis\nF\t lexor pollicis brevis (in many people).\nLesion at the wrist (carpal tunnel)4,5\nUse the pen-touching test to assess for weakness of \nthe abductor pollicis brevis. Ask the patient to lay the \nhand flat, palm upwards on the table, and attempt to \nabduct the thumb vertically to touch your pen held \nabove it (see Fig. 34.22). This may be impossible if \nthere is a median nerve palsy at the wrist or above. \nRemember, however, that most patients with the carpal \ntunnel syndrome have normal power and may indeed \nhave symptoms but no signs at all.

Pain is \noften prominent, especially when there has been nerve \nroot avulsion. A neurological cause is more likely if \nthere is dull pain that is difficult to localise, if the pain \nis not related to limb movement and is worse at night \nand if there is no associated tenderness. The patient \nmay be unable to get comfortable. An orthopaedic or \ntraumatic cause is more likely if the pain is much worse \nwith movement, or there are signs of inflammation, \njoint deformity or local tenderness.

Place one hand under \na chosen knee and then abruptly pull the knee upwards, \ncausing flexion. When the patient is relaxed this should \noccur without resistance. Then, supporting the thigh, \nflex and extend the knee at increasing velocity, feeling \nfor resistance to muscle stretch (tone). Tone in the legs \nmay also be tested by sitting the patient with legs \nhanging freely over the edge of the bed. Raise one of \nthe patient’s legs to the horizontal and then suddenly \nlet go. The leg will oscillate up to half a dozen times \nin a healthy person who is completely relaxed. If \nhypotonia is present, as occurs in cerebellar disease, \nthe oscillations will be wider and more prolonged. If \nincreased tone or spasticity is present, the movements \nwill be irregular and jerky.\nNext test for clonus of the ankle and knee. This is a \nsustained rhythmical contraction of the muscles when \nput under sudden stretch. It is due to hypertonia from \nan upper motor neurone lesion. It represents an increase \nin reflex excitability (from increased alpha motor neurone \nactivity).\nSharply dorsiflex the foot with the knee bent and \nthe thigh externally rotated.

Somatisation disorders vary in their nature \naccording to fashion. In the 19th century, hysterical paralysis was common. \nBabinski, while strolling through his ward, casually stroked the soles of \nthe feet of two patients in adjoining beds (this would probably lead to \nhis being struck off the medical register today). He noticed that the big \ntoe of the woman thought to have hysterical paralysis moved down and \nthat of the woman whose paralysis was thought genuine and due to a \nstroke moved up. The sign was probably first described by Ernst Remak \nin 1893. Babinski was a famous gourmet and assistant to Charcot.\nThe knee jerk with reinforcement: ‘Grip your \nfingers and pull your hands apart’ \nFIGURE 34.39 \nReflexes\nTest the following reflexes.\nKnee jerk (L3, L4)\nSlide one arm under the patient’s knees so that they \nare slightly bent and supported. The tendon hammer \nis allowed to fall onto the infrapatellar tendon (see Fig. \n34.38). Normally, contraction of the quadriceps causes \nextension of the knee. Compare the two sides. If the \nknee jerk appears to be absent on one or both sides, \nit should be tested again following a reinforcement \nmanoeuvre. Ask the patient to interlock the fingers \nand then pull apart hard at the moment before the \nhammer strikes the tendon (Jendrassik’s manoeuvre;n \nsee Fig. 34.39). This manoeuvre has been shown to \nrestore an apparently absent ankle jerk in 70% of elderly \npeople. A reinforcement manoeuvre such as this, or \nteeth-clenching or grasping an object, should be used \nif there is difficulty eliciting any of the muscle stretch \nreflexes.\nAnkle jerk (S1, S2)\nHave the foot in the mid-position at the ankle with \nthe knee bent, the thigh externally rotated on the bed \nand the foot held in dorsiflexion by you. Allow the \nhammer to fall on the Achilles tendon (see Fig. 34.40). \nThe normal response is plantar flexion of the foot with \ncontraction of the gastrocnemius muscle. Again, test \nwith reinforcement if appropriate. This reflex can also \nbe tested with the patient kneeling or by tapping the \nsole of the foot.6\nPlantar reflex (L5, S1, S2)\nAfter telling the patient what is going to happen, use \na blunt object (such as the key to an expensive car) to \nstroke up the lateral aspect of the sole and curve inwards \nbefore it reaches the toes, moving towards the middle \nmetatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint (see Fig. 34.41). The \npatient’s foot should be in the same position as for \ntesting the ankle jerk. The normal response is flexion \nof the big toe at the MTP joint in patients over 1 year \nof age. The extensor (Babinskio)7 response is abnormal \nand is characterised by extension of the big toe at the \nMTP joint (the upgoing toe) and fanning of the other \ntoes. This indicates an upper motor neurone (pyramidal) \n",

Closing \nthe eyes makes little difference to this in cerebellar \ndisease, but if there is posterior column loss the \nmovements are made worse when the eyes are shut—\nthat is, there is ‘sensory ataxia’.\nToe–finger test\nUnfortunately, a toe–nose test is not a practical way \nof assessing the lower limbs, so a toe–finger test is \nused.

Next test proprioception, using the \nbig toes (see Fig. 34.45) and, if necessary, the knees \nand hips.\nFinally, test light touch bilaterally for neglect. Light \ntouch can also be tested using a twirl of cottonwool \nor a microfibre tester (see Fig. 34.46). This sensation \nis especially protective against the development of ulcers \nin the feet.\nDermatomes\nMemorise the following rough guide (see Fig. 34.47):\n•\t L2 supplies the upper anterior thigh.\n•\t L3 supplies the area around the front of the knee.\n•\t L4 supplies the medial aspect of the leg.\n•\t L5 supplies the lateral aspect of the leg and the \nmedial side of the dorsum of the foot.\n•\t S1 supplies the heel and most of the sole.\n•\t S2 supplies the posterior aspect of the thigh.\n•\t S3, S4 and S5 supply concentric rings around the \nanus.\nSensory levels\nIf there is peripheral sensory loss in the leg, attempt \nto map out the upper level with a pin, moving up at \n5-centimetre intervals initially, from the leg to the \nabdomen, until the patient reports it to be sharp. This \nmay involve testing over the abdominal or even the chest \ndermatomes. Establishing a sensory level on the trunk \nindicates the spinal cord level that is affected. Remember, \na level of hyperaesthesia (increased sensitivity) often \noccurs above the sensory level and it is the upper level \nof this that should be determined, as it usually indicates \nthe highest affected spinal segment. Also remember \nthat the level of a vertebral body only corresponds to \nthe spinal cord level in the upper cervical cord because \nthe spinal cord is shorter than the spinal canal. The \nC8 spinal segment lies opposite the C7 vertebra. In \nthe upper thoracic cord there is a difference of about \ntwo segments and in the midthoracic cord it is three \nsegments. All the lumbosacral segments are opposite \nthe T11 to L1 vertebrae.\nThe superficial or cutaneous reflexes\nThese reflexes occur in response to light touch or \nscratching of the skin or mucous membranes. The \nstimulus is more superficial than the tendon (muscle \nstretch) reflexes. As a rule these reflexes occur more \nslowly after the stimulus, are less constantly present \nand fatigue more easily.\nExamples include the palmar or grasp reflex, the \nabdominal reflexes, the cremasteric reflex and the \nplantar responses.\nThe abdominal reflexes (epigastric T6–T9, \nmidabdominal T9–T11, lower abdominal \nT11–L1) (See the OSCE video Abdominal \nreflexes at \n)\nTest these by lightly stroking the abdominal wall \ndiagonally towards the umbilicus in each of the four \nquadrants of the abdomen (see Fig. 34.48).

It is \nimportant to be able to distinguish upper motor neurone \nsigns from lower motor neurone signs (see Fig. 34.1 on \np 549 and List 35.3 on p 583). The former occur when \na lesion has interrupted a neural pathway at a level \nabove the anterior horn cell—for example, motor \npathways in the cerebral cortex, internal capsule, \ncerebral peduncles, brainstem or spinal cord. When \nthis occurs there is greater weakness of abductors and \nextensors in the upper limb, and of flexors and abductors \nin the lower limb, as the normal function of this pathway \nis to mediate voluntary contraction of the antigravity \nmuscles. All muscles, however, are usually weaker than \nnormal. Muscle wasting is slight or absent, probably \nbecause there is no loss of trophic factors normally \nreleased from the lower motor neurone. The disuse \nthat results from severe weakness may, however, cause \nsome atrophy.\nUpper motor neurone signs occur when the lesion \nis in the brain or spinal cord above the level of the \nlower motor neurone (see List 35.1).\nSpasticity occurs because of destruction of the \ncorticoreticulospinal tract, resulting in stretch reflex \nhyperactivity.\nMonoplegia is paralysis affecting only one limb, \nwhen there is a motor cortex or partial internal capsule \nlesion. Hemiplegia affects one side of the body owing \nto a lesion affecting projection of pathways from the \ncontralateral motor cortex.\nParaplegia affects both legs, whereas quadriplegia \naffects all four limbs and is the result of spinal cord \ntrauma or, less often, a brainstem lesion (e.g. basilar \nartery thrombosis).\nCauses of hemiplegia (upper \nmotor neurone lesion)\nVascular disease (stroke or TIA)\nThrombosis, embolism or haemorrhage occur in specific \nvascular territories (see Fig. 35.1).1,2 The deficit usually \nprogresses over a period of minutes, but continuing \ndeterioration may occur over hours or days as a result \nof oedema or haemorrhage around or into the infarct. \nA transient ischaemic attack (TIA) is an episode of \nfocal neurological disturbance attributable to a transient \nvascular occlusion, without evidence of stroke on \nimaging. Typically this lasts no more than an hour or \ntwo, and the historical benchmark of 24 hours was \nprobably inappropriately long. If any neurological \nsymptoms persist, the episode is not a TIA. Lesions in \nthe territory of the internal carotid artery result in \nhemiplegia on the opposite side of the body if a large \n",

A typical sensory change is a symmetrical \n‘glove and stocking’ loss (though the hands should not \nbe involved until the neuropathy reaches the level of \nthe knees) of pain and temperature, proprioception \nand vibration modalities (see Fig. 35.2). This is unlike \nthe pattern found with individual nerve or nerve root \ndisease, which should be suspected if sensory loss is \nasymmetrical or confined to one limb. Peripheral muscle \nweakness may be present owing to motor nerve \ninvolvement. Occasionally, motor neuropathy may occur \nwithout sensory change.

They may well not exist in other cerebellar \nproblems. Students will, however, still be expected to know how to test \nfor these signs.\nTHE CEREBELLUM\nIf the patient complains of clumsiness or problems with \ncoordination of movement, a cerebellar examination \nis indicated (see Fig. 35.14). Signs of cerebellar disease \noccur on the same side as the lesion in the brain. \nThis is because most cerebellar fibres cross twice in \nthe brainstem, both on entry to and on exit from the \ncerebellum. Proceed as follows with the examination.\nLook first for nystagmus—usually jerky horizontal \nnystagmus with increased amplitude on looking towards \nthe side of the lesion. The direction of fast movement \nis the side of the lesion. There may also be upbeat \nnystagmus. Assess for hypometric or hypermetric \nsaccades, and difficulty with smooth pursuit.

Walking heel to toe will be difficult \n(see Fig. 34.54 on p 578).\nTesting for propulsion or retropulsion (propulsion \ninvolves pushing the patient from behind and \nretropulsion pushing from in front) is of uncertain \nvalue and must be done with some caution because \nthe patient may be unable to stop and may fall over. \nYou can stand behind the patient and pull him or her \nbackwards, but should stand braced to catch the patient.\nBradykinesia (a decrease in the speed and amplitude \nof complex movements) may be the result of a lesion \nin the nigrostriatal pathway (a dopaminergic pathway), \nwhich affects connections between the caudate nucleus, \nthe putamen and the motor cortex, causing abnormal \nmovement programming and abnormal recruitment \nof single motor units. Two simple tests (see Fig. 35.16) \nfor this are finger tapping and twiddling. Ask the patient \nto tap the fingers in turn onto a surface repeatedly, \nquickly and with both hands at once. Twiddling is \nrotating the hands around each other in front of the \nbody. These movements are slow and clumsy in \nParkinsonian patients but obviously depend on motor \nand cerebellar function as well. Difficulty in getting \nout of a chair can be another sign of bradykinesia and \npatients also often have difficulty turning over in bed.\nKinesia paradoxica is the striking ability of a patient \nto perform rapid movements (especially if startled) \nbut not slow ones; for example, the patient may be \nable to run down the stairs in response to a fire alarm \nbut be unable to stop at the bottom—this is not a \nrecommended test.\nTremor\nHave the patient return to bed. Look for a resting tremor, \nwhich is often asymmetrical. The characteristic \nmovement is described as pill rolling. Movement of \nthe fingers at the metacarpophalangeal joints is \ncombined with the movements of the thumb. Various \nattending movements may also occur at the wrist. On \nfinger–nose testing the resting tremor decreases, but \na faster-action tremor may supervene.\nTremor can be facilitated by getting the patient to \nperform ‘serial 7s’—take 7 from 100, then 7 from the \nanswer and so forth (mental stimulation)—or to move \nthe contralateral limb (e.g. by rapidly opposing the \ncontralateral thumb and fingers). Other types of tremor \nare summarised in List 35.14.\nTone\nTest the tone at both wrists. The characteristic increase \nin tone is called cogwheel or plastic (lead pipe) rigidity. \nTone is increased with an interrupted nature, the \nmuscles giving way with a series of jerks. If hypertonia \nis not obvious, obtain reinforcement by asking the \npatient to turn the head from side to side or to wave \nthe contralateral arm. Cogwheel rigidity occurs because \nthe exaggerated stretch reflex is interrupted by tremor.\nRemember, the signs should be asymmetrical early \nin the course of Parkinson’s disease.\nFace\nThere may be titubation (tremor) of the head, absence \nof blinking, dribbling of saliva and lack of facial \nexpression.

Parkinson’s disease\n3.\t Dystonic tremor\n4.\t Postural / action tremor: present throughout \nmovement; the following most often cause a \nstatic or postural tremor of the outstretched \narms:\n○ Idiopathic (most common)\n○\t Anxiety\n○\t Drugs\n○\t Familial\n○\t Thyrotoxicosis\n5. Essential / familial\n6. Intention tremor (cerebellar disease): increases \ntowards the target\n7. Midbrain (‘red nucleus’) tremor: abduction–\nadduction movements of upper limbs with \nflexion–extension of wrists (usually associated \nwith intention tremor)\nNote: Flapping (asterixis) is not strictly a tremor but rather \na sudden brief loss of tone in hepatic failure, cardiac \nfailure, respiratory failure or renal failure (metabolic \nencephalopathies).\nLIST 35.14 \n*Tremor is a rhythmic oscillation of a part of the body around \na fixed point.\na\nb\n(a) and (b) The glabellar tap (Wilson’s sign) \nFIGURE 35.17 \nfinger out of the patient’s line of vision, tap the middle \nof the patient’s forehead (glabella) with your middle \nfinger (see Fig. 35.17). This sign is positive when the \npatient continues to blink as long as you tap. Normal \npeople blink only a couple of times and then stop. The \nglabellar reflex is a primitive reflex that is also frequently \npresent in frontal lobe disease.\nAssess speech, which is typically monotonous, soft \nand faint, lacking intonation. Sometimes palilalia is \npresent; this is repetition of the end of a word (the \nopposite of stuttering).\nNow test ocular movements, particularly for \nweakness of vertical gaze. Early loss of vertical saccades \nand convergence should raise the possibility of \nprogressive supranuclear palsy. This group of patients \nmay look Parkinsonian superficially, but have marked \nrigidity, early dementia and frequent falls. These people \ndevelop loss of downward gaze first, then loss of upward \ngaze and finally loss of horizontal gaze. Their prognosis \nis significantly worse.\nFeel the brow for greasiness (seborrhoea) or \nsweating, which is due to associated autonomic \ndysfunction. Orthostatic hypotension may also be \npresent for the same reason.\nThe palmomental reflex is commonly present in \nthese patients and tends to be more prominent in those \nwith severe akinesia. Dementia is present in 30% of \npatients.\nWriting\nAsk the patient to write his or her name and address. \nMicrographia (small writing) is characteristic. The \npatient may also be unable to do this because of the \ndevelopment of dementia, a late manifestation. Test \nthe higher centres if appropriate.\nGood signs guide 35.1 lists the likelihood ratios of \nthe major signs.\nCauses of Parkinson’s \nsyndrome\nThese are shown in List 35.15.\n",

St Vitus, a martyr, died in \nabout 303. He is the patron saint of epileptics and of patients with \nSydenham’s chorea.\ng\t Thomas Sydenham (1624–89) was a captain in Cromwell’s army and \nbecame the most famous English physician of his time, providing clinical \ndescriptions of gout (from which he suffered), fevers, hysteria and venereal \ndisease. He was called the Father of English Clinical Medicine.\nh\t George Huntington (1850–1916), an American general practitioner. He \ndescribed this disease in his only clinical paper in 1872, when he was 22.\nOTHER EXTRAPYRAMIDAL \nMOVEMENT DISORDERS \n(DYSKINESIA)\nChorea\nHere there is a lesion of the corpus striatum, which \ncauses non-repetitive, abrupt, involuntary flowing \ndance-like movements.f These may be unilateral or \ngeneralised. Often the patient attempts to disguise this \nby completing the involuntary movements with a \nvoluntary one. In this disease, dopaminergic pathways \ndominate over cholinergic transmissions.\nChorea can usefully be distinguished from \nhemiballismus, \nathetosis \nand \npseudoathetosis. \nHemiballismus is due to a subthalamic lesion on the \nside opposite the movement disorder. It causes unilateral \nwild, throwing movements of the proximal joints. There \nmay be skin excoriation due to limb trauma. These \nmovements may persist during sleep. Athetosis or \ndystonia is due to a lesion of the outer segment of the \nputamen and causes slow sinuous writhing distal \nmovements that are present at rest. Pseudoathetosis is \na description given to athetoid movements in the fingers \nin patients with severe proprioceptive loss (these are \nespecially prominent when the eyes are shut).\nIf the patient has chorea or if chorea is suspected, \nproceed as follows. First shake hands. There may be \ntremor and dystonia superimposed on lack of sustained \nhandgrip (‘milkmaid’s grip’). Ask the patient to hold \nout the hands, then look for a choreic (dystonic) posture. \nThis typically involves finger and thumb hyperextension \nand wrist flexion.\nGo to the face and look at the eyes for exophthalmos \n(thyrotoxicosis), Kayser–Fleischer rings (Wilson’s \ndisease) and conjunctival injection (polycythaemia). \nAsk the patient to poke out the tongue and note frequent \nretraction of the tongue (serpentine movements). Look \nfor skin rashes (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus, \nvasculitis). If the patient is a young girl, examine the \nheart for signs of rheumatic fever (Sydenham’sg chorea).\nTest the reflexes. The abdominal reflexes are usually \nbrisk, but tendon reflexes are reduced and may be \npendular (because of hypotonia).\nAssess the higher centres for dementia (Huntington’sh \nchorea).\nCauses of chorea are shown in List 35.16.\nDystonia\nThe patient manifests an involuntary abnormal posture \nwith excessive co-contraction of antagonist muscles. \nDystonia may be focal (e.g. spasmodic torticollis), \nsegmental or generalised. Other forms of movement \ndisorder may be present (e.g. myoclonic dystonia). The \nacute onset of dystonia is seen most commonly as a side \n",

Patients can suppress them to some extent, \nbut often at the expense of later outbursts. They may \nbegin as an automatic or voluntary reaction to a local \nstimulus or external anxiety and then become \ncompulsive. For example, an episode of conjunctivitis \nmight lead to a blinking tic that continues after the \nstimulus has gone. The facial muscles, eyes and mouth \nare often affected and spasmodic rotation of the head \nis a common form. Respiratory tics include sneezing, \ncoughing and hiccup. Simple tics usually begin in \nchildhood and resolve or diminish in adult life.\nComplicated motor tics that begin in childhood, \nlast for more than a year and involve vocal tics suggest \nde la Tourette’s syndrome.i Vocal tics include repetition \nof other people’s speech (echolalia) and, rarely, the \nexplosive use of obscenities (coprolalia). The patient \nfeels an increasing urge to carry out the movement or \nvocal tic and increasing discomfort until he or she \ngives in to it.j Common associations include:\n•\t obsessive compulsive disorder\n•\t attention deficit disorder\n•\t mood disorders.\nTHE UNCONSCIOUS PATIENT\nThe rapid and efficient examination of the unconscious \npatient is important. The word COMA provides \na mnemonic for four major groups of causes of \nunconsciousness:\n\tC\tO2 narcosis (respiratory failure: uncommon)\n\tO\tverdose (e.g. tranquillisers, alcohol, salicylates, \ncarbon monoxide, antidepressants)\n\tM\tetabolic (e.g. hypoglycaemia, diabetic \nketoacidosis, end stage renal disease, \nhypothyroidism, hepatic coma, hypercalcaemia, \nadrenal failure)\n\tA\tpoplexy (e.g. head injury, stroke [infarction or \nhaemorrhage], subdural or extradural haematoma, \nmeningitis, encephalitis, epilepsy).\nComa occurs when the reticular formation is damaged \nby a lesion or metabolic abnormality, or when the cortex \nis diffusely damaged.\nGeneral inspection\nRemember ABC:\n\tA\tirway\n\tB\treathing\n\tC\tirculation.\nAirway and breathing\nLook to see whether the patient is breathing, as indicated \nby chest wall movement. If not, urgent attention is \nrequired, including clearing the airway and providing \nventilation.\nNote particularly the pattern of breathing (see Table \n9.4 on p 170). Important signs to look for are Cheyne–\nStokes respiration (the rate and depth of respiration \nwaxes and wanes often to the point of ceasing altogether \nfor periods, which may indicate diencephalic injury, \nbut is not specific), irregular ataxic breathing (Biot’s \nbreathing, from an advanced brainstem lesion) and deep \ni\t\nGeorges Albert Edouard Brutus Gilles de la Tourette, a French neurologist \n1857–1904, described this condition in 1884 and called it maladie des \ntics. It was renamed ‘maladie Gilles de la Tourette’ by Charcot. De la Tourette \nwas shot in the head by a former patient in 1893.\nj\t\nDr Samuel Johnson is a famous de la Tourette patient (at least in retrospect).\n",

Note any neck hyperextension \n(from meningism in children or cerebellar tonsillar \nherniation).\nLook for:\n1.\tA decerebrate or extensor posture, which may be \nheld spontaneously or occur in response to \nstimuli, and which suggests severe midbrain \ndisease. The arms are held extended and \ninternally rotated and the legs are extended.\n2.\tA decorticate or flexor posture, which suggests a \nlesion above the brainstem.

There is flexion and internal rotation \nof the arms and extension of the legs.\nInvoluntary movements\nRecurrent or continuous convulsions, which may \nbe focal or generalised, suggest status epilepticus. \nMyoclonic jerks can occur after hypoxic injury and as \na result of metabolic encephalopathy. Remember that \ncomplex partial seizure status epilepticus can cause a \nreduced level of consciousness without convulsive \nmovements.\nLevel of consciousness\nTickle the patient’s nose with cottonwool and watch \nfor facial movements. This is less likely to harm the \npatient than the traditional method of firmly pressing \nthe knuckles over the patient’s sternum to cause pain.\nDetermine the level of consciousness. Coma is \nunconsciousness with a reduced response to external \nstimuli. Coma in which the patient responds \nsemipurposefully is considered light. In deep coma \nthere is no response to any stimuli and no reflexes are \npresent (it is usually due to a brainstem or pontine \nlesion, although drug overdose, such as with barbiturates, \ncan be responsible). Stupor is unconsciousness, but the \npatient can be aroused. Purposeful movements occur \nin response to painful stimuli. Drowsiness resembles \nnormal sleepiness. The patient can be fairly easily roused \nto normal wakefulness, but when left alone falls asleep \nagain.\nIt is most useful to score the depth of coma, as \nchanges in the level of consciousness can then be judged \nmore objectively. The Glasgow Coma Scale (see Table \n35.4) is used to assess the depth of coma more \naccurately; record the subscores and total scores.\n",

Look for facial asymmetry (i.e. \nfacial weakness). The paralysed side of the face will be \nsucked in and out with respiration. A painful stimulus \n(e.g. pressing the supraorbital notch) may produce \ngrimacing and make facial asymmetry more obvious. \nNote jaundice (e.g. hepatic coma) or manifestations \nof myxoedema.\nEyes\nInspect the pupils. Very small pupils (but reactive \nto light) occur in pontine lesions and with narcotic \noverdoses. One small pupil occurs in Horner’s syndrome \n(e.g. as part of the lateral medullary syndrome or in \nhypothalamus injury; see Fig. 35.18). Two midpoint \nnon-reactive pupils suggest midbrain disease, anoxia \nor drugs (anticholinergics). One dilated pupil suggests \na subdural haematoma, raised intracranial pressure \n(unilateral tentorial herniation) or a subarachnoid \nhaemorrhage from a posterior communicating \nartery aneurysm. Widely dilated pupils may occur \nwhen increased intracranial pressure and coning \ncause secondary brainstem haemorrhage, or with \nanticholinergic drugs.\nConjunctival haemorrhage suggests skull fracture. \nLook in the fundi for papilloedema, diabetic or \nhypertensive retinopathy, or subhyaloid haemorrhage. \nThe locked-in syndrome is rare; in a lower brainstem \nlesion patients are awake but can control only their \neye movements (see p 876).\nLook at the position of the eyes. Particular cranial \nnerve palsies may cause deviation of an eye in various \ndirections. The sixth nerve is particularly vulnerable \nto damage because of its long intracranial course. \nDeviation of both eyes to one side in the unconscious \npatient may be due to a destructive lesion in a cerebral \nhemisphere, which causes fixed deviation towards the \nside of the lesion. An irritative (epileptic) focus causes \nthe direction of gaze to be away from the lesion. Upward \nor downward eye deviation suggests a brainstem \nproblem. Trapping of the globe or extraocular muscles \nby fracture may also lead to an abnormal eye position \nor to an abnormal eye movement.\nAssess the vestibulo-ocular reflex by lifting the \npatient’s eyelids and rolling the head from side to side. \nWhen vestibular reflexes are intact (i.e. an intact \nbrainstem), the eyes maintain their fixation as if looking \nat an object in the distance, but change their position \nrelative to the head. This has been referred to as the \n‘doll’s eye phenomenon’. Brainstem lesions or drugs \naffecting the brainstem cause the eyes to move with \nthe head, so that fixation is not maintained.\nEars and nostrils\nLook for any bleeding or drainage of cerebrospinal \nfluid (the latter indicating a skull fracture). A watery \ndischarge can be simply tested for glucose. The presence \nof glucose confirms that it is cerebrospinal fluid.\nTongue and mouth\nTrauma may indicate a previous seizure, and corrosion \naround the mouth may indicate ingestion of a corrosive \npoison. Gum hyperplasia suggests that the patient may \nbe taking phenytoin for epilepsy. Smell the breath for \nevidence of alcohol poisoning, diabetic ketosis, hepatic \ncoma or uraemia.

Test tone in the normal way and by picking \nup the arm and letting it fall. Compare each side, \nassessing for evidence of hemiplegia. In coma and acute \ncerebral hemiplegia, the muscle stretch reflexes may \nbe normal or reduced at first on the paralysed side. \nLater the muscle stretch reflexes become increased and \nthe cutaneous reflexes are absent.\nTest for pain sensation by placing a pen over a distal \nfinger or toe just below the nail bed. Press firmly and \nnote whether there is arm or leg withdrawal. Test all \nlimbs. There will be no response to pain if sensation \nis absent or if the coma is deep. If sensation is intact \nbut the limb is paralysed, there may be grimacing with \nmovement of the other limbs.\nThe presence of grimacing or purposeful movements \nis important. Segmental reflexes alone can cause the \nlimb to move in response to pain.\nBody\nLook for signs of trauma. Examine the heart, lungs \nand abdomen.\nUrine\nNote whether there is incontinence.

Examine \nthe external auditory canals and the eardrums if this \nis indicated. Do a Dix–Hallpike test if the history \nsuggests benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV).\nThe ninth and tenth nerves\nLook at the palate and note any uvular displacement. \nAsk the patient to say ‘Ah’ and look for symmetrical \nmovement of the soft palate. A unilateral lesion causes \nthe uvula to be drawn towards the unaffected (normal) \nside. Test gently for sensation on the palate (the ninth \nnerve). Ask the patient to speak to assess hoarseness, \nand to cough. A bovine cough suggests bilateral \nrecurrent laryngeal nerve lesions.\nThe twelfth nerve\nWhile examining the mouth, inspect the tongue for \nwasting and fasciculation. Next ask the patient to \nprotrude the tongue. With a unilateral lesion the tongue \ndeviates towards the weaker (affected) side.\nThe eleventh nerve\nLook for torticollis and test the sternocleidomastoid \nand trapezius muscles. Ask the patient to shrug the \nshoulders and feel the trapezius as you push the \nshoulders down. Then ask the patient to turn his or \nher head against resistance and also feel the bulk of \nthe sternocleidomastoid. Then examine the skull and \nauscultate for carotid bruits.\nUpper limbs\nShake the patient’s hand firmly. Ask him or her to sit \nover the side of the bed facing you, if possible.\nExamine the motor system systematically every time. \nInspect first for wasting (both proximally and distally) \nand fasciculations. Do not forget to include the shoulder \ngirdle in your inspection.\nAsk the patient to hold both hands out (palms up) \nwith the arms extended and close the eyes. Look for \ndrifting of one or both arms (upper motor neurone \nweakness, cerebellar lesion or posterior column loss). \nAlso note any tremor or pseudoathetosis due to \nproprioceptive loss.\nFeel the muscle bulk next, both proximally and \ndistally, and note any muscle tenderness.\nThe third, fourth and sixth nerves\nLook at the pupils, noting the shape, relative sizes and \nany associated ptosis. Use a pocket torch and shine the \nlight from the side to gauge the reaction of the pupils \nto light. Assess quickly both the direct and the \nconsensual responses. Look for an afferent pupillary \ndefect by moving the torch in an arc from pupil to \npupil. Test accommodation by asking the patient to \nlook into the distance and then at the hat-pin or your \nfinger held about 30 centimetres from the patient’s nose.\nAssess eye movements with both eyes first, getting \nthe patient to follow the pin in each direction. Test \nsaccadic movements horizontally and vertically. Look \nfor failure of movement and for nystagmus. Ask about \ndiplopia in each direction. Do a head impulse test (see \nFig. 32.17, p 518) horizontally if there is nystagmus \nsuggestive of a peripheral lesion.\nThe fifth nerve\nTest the corneal reflexes gently and ask the patient if \nhe or she can feel the touch of a piece of cottonwool \non the cornea. The sensory component of this reflex \nis nerve V and the motor component is VII.\nTest facial sensation in the three divisions: \nophthalmic, maxillary and mandibular. Test pain \nsensation with the pin first and map any area of sensory \nloss from dull to sharp. Test light touch as well so that \nsensory dissociation can be detected if present.\nExamine the motor division of the fifth nerve by \nasking the patient to clench the teeth while you feel \nthe masseter muscles. Then get the patient to open the \nmouth while you attempt to force it closed; this is not \npossible if the pterygoid muscles are working. A \nunilateral lesion causes the jaw to deviate towards the \nweak (affected) side.\nTest the jaw jerk. This is increased in cases of \npseudobulbar palsy.\nThe seventh nerve\nTest the muscles of facial expression. Ask the patient \nto look up and wrinkle the forehead. Look for loss of \nwrinkling and feel the muscle strength by pushing down \non each side. This is preserved in upper motor neurone \nlesions because of bilateral cortical representation of \nthese muscles.\nNext ask the patient to shut the eyes tightly and \ncompare the two sides. Tell the patient to grin and \ncompare the nasolabial grooves.\n",

Students can do either first but must appear proficient at both.\nTest tone at the wrists and elbows by passively \nmoving the joints at varying velocities.\nAssess power at the shoulders, elbows, wrists and \nfingers.\nIf indicated, test for an ulnar nerve lesion (Froment’s \nsign) and a median nerve lesion (pen-touching test).\nExamine the reflexes: biceps (C5, C6), triceps (C7, \nC8) and brachioradialis (C5, C6).\nAssess coordination with finger–nose testing and \nlook for dysdiadochokinesis and rebound.\nMotor weakness can be due to an upper motor \nneurone lesion, a lower motor neurone lesion or a \nmyopathy. If there is evidence of a lower motor neurone \nlesion, consider anterior horn cell, nerve root or brachial \nplexus lesions, peripheral nerve lesions or a motor \nperipheral neuropathy.\nExamine the sensory system after motor testing, \nbecause this can be time consuming.\nFirst test the spinothalamic pathway (pain and \ntemperature). Confirm any abnormality with pinprick. \nDemonstrate to the patient the sharpness of a pin on \nthe anterior chest wall or forehead. Then ask him or \nher to close the eyes and tell you whether the sensation \nis sharp or dull. Start proximally and test each \ndermatome working distally to proximally. Map the \nabnormal area. As you are assessing, try to fit any \nsensory loss into dermatomal (cord or nerve root \nlesion), peripheral nerve, peripheral neuropathy (glove) \nor hemisensory (cortical or cord) distribution. Test \ncold sensation and quickly work distally to proximally \ncovering all dermatomes.a\nNext test the posterior column pathway (vibration \nand proprioception). Use a 128 Hz tuning fork to assess \nvibration sense. Place the vibrating fork on a distal \ninterphalangeal joint when the patient has the eyes closed \nand ask what can be felt. To confirm, ask the patient to \ntell you when the vibration ceases and then, after a short \nwait, stop the vibrations. If the patient has deficient \nsensation, test at the wrist, then at the elbow and then \nat the shoulder.\nExamine \nproprioception \nwith \nthe \ndistal \ninterphalangeal joint of the little finger. When the \npatient has the eyes open, grasp the distal phalanx \nfrom the sides and move it up and down to demonstrate; \nthen ask the patient to close the eyes and repeat the \nmanoeuvre. Normally, movement through even a few \ndegrees is detectable, and the patient can tell whether \nit is up or down. If there is an abnormality, test larger \nmovements and then proceed to test the wrist and \nelbows similarly if necessary.\nTest sensation bilaterally simultaneously with touch \nfrom your fingers, assessing for extinction or neglect. \nLight touch can be done with cottonwool, but is seldom \nof value when other modalities have been tested.\nFeel for thickened nerves—the ulnar at the elbow, \nthe median at the wrist and the radial at the wrist—and \nfeel the axillae if there is evidence of a proximal lesion. \nNote any scars, and finally examine the neck if relevant.\nLower limbs\nTest the stance and gait first if possible. Then put the \npatient in bed with the legs entirely exposed. Place a \ntowel over the groin—note whether a urinary catheter \nis present.\nLook for muscle wasting and fasciculations. Note \nany tremor. Feel the muscle bulk of the quadriceps \nand run your hand up each shin, feeling for wasting \nof the anterior tibial muscles.\nTest tone at the knees and ankles. Test clonus at \nthis time. Push the lower end of the quadriceps sharply \ndown towards the knee. Sustained rhythmical \ncontractions indicate an upper motor neurone lesion. \nAlso test the ankle by sharply dorsiflexing the foot \nwith the knee bent and the thigh externally rotated.\nAssess power next at the hips, knees and ankles.\nElicit the reflexes: knee (L3, L4), ankle (S1, S2) and \nplantar responses (L5, S1, S2).\nTest coordination with the heel–shin test, toe–finger \ntest and tapping of the feet.\nExamine the sensory system as for the upper limbs: \npinprick and cold, then vibration and proprioception, \nand then light touch if required. If there is a peripheral \nsensory loss, attempt to establish a sensory level by \nmoving the pin or cold tuning fork up the leg and onto \nthe abdomen and, if necessary, onto the chest. Examine \nsensation in the saddle region and test the anal reflex \n(S2, S3, S4).\nGo to the back. Look for deformity, scars and \nneurofibromas. Palpate for tenderness over the vertebral \nbodies and auscultate for bruits. Perform the straight \nleg-raising test.\n",

Imaging can confirm the location of the \nlesion and the likely pathology. Special testing is guided \nby the clinical setting.\nLumbar puncture\nIf acute meningitis is suspected, or less often if a CT \nof the brain is negative but you clinically suspect a \nsubarachnoid haemorrhage, a lumbar puncture (LP) is \nindicated. An LP may also help in the diagnosis of \ncertain neurological diseases, such as carcinomatous \nmeningitis, tuberculous meningitis, central nervous \nsystem syphilis or vasculitis, idiopathic intracranial \nhypertension (pseudotumour cerebri) or normal-pressure \nhydrocephalus. An LP may also be helpful in diagnosing \nmultiple sclerosis, Guillain–Barré syndrome or a \nparaneoplastic syndrome.\nIf there is papilloedema on fundoscopy or focal \nneurological signs (e.g. one side is weak), or the patient \nis immunocompromised, a computed tomography (CT) \nor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain \nshould be undertaken beforehand so as to exclude raised \nintracranial pressure (because of the risk of cerebral \nherniation after an LP in this setting).\nThe cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is sent for Gram \nstaining and culture as well as cell count and differential, \nprotein and glucose testing. Additional molecular tests \nfor Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pnueumoniae, \nHaemophilus influenzae type B, Listeria monocytogenes, \nMycobacterium tuberculosis, herpes simplex and varicella \ncan be performed when indicated. Cryptococcal antigen, \nsyphilis serology and fungal serology can be tested if \nnecessary.\nNeurological imaging\nCT and MRI scans have revolutionised neurological \ninvestigations. These techniques are generally non-\ninvasive, although CT scans expose patients to \nmoderately large doses of radiation and both types of \nscans are often used with contrast agents, which can \naffect some patients. MRI scans cannot be performed \non patients with magnetic metal implants (e.g. most \npacemakers).\nInterpretation of the scans often requires the \nassessment of multiple planes and slices or of \nthree-dimensional reconstructions.\nSome common examples of important diagnostic \nscans are shown in Figs 36.3–36.10.\nCT scan shows an ischaemic stroke on the \nright (left side of the image—white arrow) \nand a haemorrhage on the left (right side of \nthe image—black arrow) \n(From Crawford M, DiMarco J, Paulus W.

      "text": "Foreword by Sarah Dalton\nThe more things change, the more they stay the same. \nWe live in a world where healthcare stands to be \nsignificantly disrupted by artificial intelligence, machine \nlearning and big data but at the same time as doctors \nwe have a fundamental responsibility to connect with \nour patients, to hear their stories and to diagnose and \ntreat their conditions with wisdom and compassion. \nSo, no matter how precise medicine can become, the \nfoundations of taking a history and performing a \ncomprehensive physical examination have never been \nmore important.\nClinical Examination by Talley and O’Connor has \nbeen widely recognised as providing the cornerstone \nto learning physical diagnoses over many decades. It \nis with some pride that I have kept my original first \nedition that accompanied me throughout medical \nschool all those years ago. The words of wisdom then \nare just as true today—that ‘treatment of the patient \nbegins the moment one reaches the bedside’. But even \nmore true, at this time heralded by over-diagnosis and \nover-investigation in healthcare, is the need to use the \nsimplest, most effective and arguably most reliable of all \ninvestigative approaches—a good history and physical \nexamination.\nIn this most recent iteration, the authors have \nexpanded their repertoire and turned their tried and \ntested formula to all medical specialties, ranging from \npaediatric medicine to specific approaches to ears, eyes, \nnose and throat assessments. The companion series \noffers the same structured approach to diagnoses, \nhighlighting important differences and bringing a \nwealth of information destined to prepare any candidate \nadmirably for a short or long case in these areas. The \ntext outlines tips and tricks designed to demystify \nthe sometimes challenging task of assessing neonates \nand children, discussing a range of approaches from \nmaternal health assessment to talking to adolescents \nand their families.\nMost doctors care for young people at some point \nin their career, and young people with medical \nconditions most definitely grow up. Thankfully our \npatients are living longer and living better, but caring \nfor chronic and complex conditions means we all need \nsome understanding of specialty issues. Many doctors \ndo not feel particularly well prepared for this challenge, \nmaking this text relevant to all clinicians. Whilst there \nis much we do not know about the future of medicine, \none thing we know for certain is that healthy young \npeople create healthy futures. From little things, big \nthings grow.\nDr Sarah Dalton \nBMed MAppMgt(Hlth) FRACP\nPaediatric Emergency Physician, \nThe Children’s Hospital at Westmead\nPresident, Division of Paediatrics and Child Health, \nThe Royal Australasian College of Physicians\n",

      "text": "Foreword by David Ellwood\nThe clinical practice of Obstetrics & Gynaecology \n(O&G) presents medical students with challenges and \nopportunities. It is, by its very nature, a very practical \ndiscipline of medicine and for this reason many students \nwill enjoy their clinical attachments immensely. O&G \nhas enormous breadth and depth and to understand \nmany common presentations requires a detailed \nknowledge of pelvic anatomy, reproductive physiology, \nmicrobiology and psychology, as well as many other \nbranches of clinical medicine. But the standard \napproaches to the patient of history and examination \nbring with them some unique difficulties in terms of \nclinical skills development. Virtually all examinations \nare intimate, and history taking must embrace the fact \nthat there are significant psychosocial aspects of both \ngynaecological and obstetric problems.\nThis second volume of the well-known Talley & \nO’Connor’s Clinical Examination (8th Edition) contains \nseparate chapters on gynaecological and obstetric history \nand examination. They can both be read separately as \nstand-alone aids for students, but will also complement \neach other when read together as there are many areas \nof overlap. Both are clear, concise, and contain many \npractical tips which will be valuable for both the junior \nmedical student encountering these clinical experiences \nfor the first time, as well as the more senior student \nrevising for final examinations. The frameworks for \nhistory taking and examination, and the many clear \nillustrations, go a long way to demystifying the subject \nmatter.\nIt is especially important for the medical student to \nunderstand some of the complexities of O&G practice. \nThe clinical etiquette around intimate gynaecological \nand obstetric examination is extremely important, \nincluding the use of chaperones. Understanding the \ninterface between a woman’s gynaecological and \nsexual health wellbeing, and how this is impacted by \npsychological factors, is also vital. In modern O&G, \nmuch of the information that used to be derived from \nclinical examination is now obtained by the liberal use \nof ultrasound, but there are many times when both \nare essential and an appreciation of how this works in \npractice is essential. These chapters manage to provide \nclear and practical advice across all of these areas.\nFinally, the diligent student of medicine will know \nthat volumes such as this, important though they are, \nare only companions to learning, and it is the patient \nfrom whom most can be learned. Armed with this \npractical guide, students should be very well-equipped \nto take advantage of all of their clinical learning \nopportunities, which will ultimately be for the good \nof the women who they encounter in the future as \npatients.\nDavid Ellwood\nProfessor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology\n",

      "text": "Preface\nAcquire the art of detachment, the virtue of method, \nand the quality of thoroughness, but above all the \ngrace of humility.\nAsk not what disease the person has, but rather what \nperson the disease has.\nSir William Osler\nWelcome to the new edition of Clinical Examination, \nwhich has been carefully revised and updated. Clinical \nskills are the foundation of clinical medicine, most \nimportantly history taking and physical examination. \nIn most cases, a good history and physical examination \nwill lead you to make the correct diagnosis, and this is \ncritical—your diagnosis will more often than not seal \nthe fate of your patient and, assuming you are correct, \ntake them down the optimal management path.\nIn order to make a correct diagnosis you need to \nassemble all the facts at hand. Blindly ordering tests in the \nabsence of the clinical history and relevant examination \noften leads to serious errors. It is distressingly common \nfor tests to be ordered and referrals made without an \nadequate history or even a cursory examination of \nthe patient. The wrong diagnosis can cause harm and \ndistress that lasts a lifetime.\nClinical Examination is designed to take students \non an exciting journey from acquiring core skills to \nan advanced level, applying a strong evidence-based \nfocus. We have taken a systematic approach because \nrecognition of all the facts aids accurate diagnosis. The \npatient presenting with, for example, heart disease may \nhave not only objective changes of disease when \nlistening to the heart but also relevant findings in the \nhands, arms, face, abdomen and legs that can guide \nidentification of the underlying disease process and \nprognosis. Diagnosticians are great medical detectives \nwho apply rigorous methodology to uncover the truth, \nsolve a puzzle and commence the healing process.\nOur book is not a traditional undergraduate textbook \nand we are proud of its distinctive features. Learning \nmust be fun! Unlike most other similar textbooks, \nours is deliberately laced with humour and historical \nanecdotes that generations of students have told us \nenhance the learning experience. Another distinguishing \nfeature is that every chapter in this book has undergone \npeer review, just as you would expect would occur for \nany published journal article. We have believed from \nthe beginning that peer review is integral to ensuring \nthe highest possible standards and maximising the \nvalue of a core textbook. In this edition based on the \npeer review process we have made revisions, excluded \nirrelevant material and added updates where appropriate. \nVideos demonstrating techniques enhance the learning \nexperience, and the e-book format supports learning \nfrom a tablet or computer anywhere and anytime. We are \nalso proud of this book being current and as evidence \nbased as is possible, with updated chapter references and \nannotations so readers can dive deeper into any of the \nliterature that interests them. We want students at all \nlevels to know there are many limitations and gaps (all \ncrying out for more research), and to remain curious \nand excited about medicine as they learn.\nClinical skills can be mastered only by practice and \nyou should aim to see as many cases as you can while \nstudying from this or any book. You will learn from \nyour patients your entire career if only you take the \ntime to listen and observe.\nGreat clinicians are made not born, and everyone \npractising medicine needs to master clinical skills. \nThank you to all those who have provided us with \nexpert input as we have made our revisions. We also \nthank all of our colleagues and patients who educate \nus daily, and the legion of students who have written \nto us, including those who have pointed out omissions \nor mistakes (real or perceived).\nNicholas J Talley\nSimon O’Connor\nNewcastle and Canberra\nJuly 2017\n",

      "text": "Clinical methods: an historical perspective\nThe best physician is the one who is able to \ndifferentiate the possible and the impossible.\nHerophilus of Alexandria (335–280BC)\nSince classical Greek times interrogation of the patient \nhas been considered most important because disease \nwas, and still is, viewed in terms of the discomfort it \ncauses. However, the current emphasis on the use of \nhistory taking and physical examination for diagnosis \ndeveloped only in the 19th century. Although the terms \n‘symptoms and signs’ have been part of the medical \nvocabulary since the revival of classical medicine, until \nrelatively recently they were used synonymously. During \nthe 19th century, the distinction between symptoms \n(subjective complaints, which the clinician learns from \nthe patient’s account of his or her feelings) and signs \n(objective morbid changes detectable by the clinician) \nevolved. Until the 19th century, diagnosis was empirical \nand based on the classical Greek belief that all disease \nhad a single cause: an imbalance of the four humours \n(yellow bile, black bile, blood and phlegm). Indeed \nthe Royal College of Physicians, founded in London \nin 1518, believed that clinical experience without \nclassical learning was useless, and physicians who were \nCollege members were fined if they ascribed to any \nother view. At the time of Hippocrates (460?–375BC), \nobservation (inspection) and feeling (palpation) had \na place in the examination of patients. The ancient \nGreeks, for example, noticed that patients with jaundice \noften had an enlarged liver that was firm and irregular. \nShaking a patient and listening for a fluid splash was \nalso recognised by the Greeks. Herophilus of Alexandria \n(335–280BC) described a method of taking the pulse \nin the 4th century BC. However, it was Galen of \nPergamum (AD130–200) who established the pulse \nas one of the major physical signs, and it continued \nto have this important role up to the 18th century, \nwith minute variations being recorded. These variations \nwere erroneously considered to indicate changes in \nthe body’s harmony. William Harvey’s (1578–1657) \nstudies of the human circulation, published in 1628, \nhad little effect on the general understanding of the \nvalue of the pulse as a sign. Sanctorius (1561–1636) \nwas the first to time the pulse using a clock, while \nJohn Floyer (1649–1734) invented the pulse watch in \n1707 and made regular observations of the pulse rate. \nAbnormalities in heart rate were described in diabetes \nmellitus in 1776 and in thyrotoxicosis in 1786. Fever was \nstudied by Hippocrates and was originally regarded as \nan entity rather than a sign of disease. The thermoscope \nwas devised by Sanctorius in 1625. In association with \nGabriel Fahrenheit (1686–1736), Hermann Boerhaave \n(1668–1738) introduced the thermometer as a research \ninstrument and this was produced commercially in \nthe middle of the 18th century. In the 13th century \nJohannes Actuarius (d. 1283) used a graduated glass \nto examine the urine. In Harvey’s time a specimen \nof urine was sometimes looked at (inspected) and \neven tasted, and was considered to reveal secrets \nabout the body. Harvey recorded that sugar diabetes \n(mellitus) and dropsy (oedema) could be diagnosed \nin this way. The detection of protein in the urine, \nwhich Frederik Dekkers (1644–1720) first described \nin 1673, was ignored until Richard Bright (1789–1858) \ndemonstrated its importance in renal disease. Although \nCelsus described and valued measurements such as \nweighing and measuring a patient in the 1st century \nAD, these methods became widely used only in the \n20th century. A renaissance in clinical methods began \nwith the concept of Battista Morgagni (1682–1771) that \ndisease was not generalised but rather arose in organs, \na conclusion published in 1761. Leopold Auenbrugger \ninvented chest tapping (percussion) to detect disease \nin the same year. Van Swieten, his teacher, in fact \n",

The technique was \nforgotten for nearly half a century until Jean Corvisart \n(1755–1821) translated Auenbrugger’s work in 1808.\nThe next big step occurred with René Laënnec \n(1781–1826), a student of Corvisart. He invented the \nstethoscope in 1816 (at first merely a roll of stiff paper) \nas an aid to diagnosing heart and lung disease by \nlistening (auscultation). This revolutionised chest \nexamination, partly because it made the chest accessible \nin patients too modest to allow a direct application of \nthe examiner’s ear to the chest wall, as well as allowing \naccurate clinicopathological correlations. William Stokes \n(1804–78) published the first treatise in English on the \nuse of the stethoscope in 1825. Josef Skoda’s (1805–81) \ninvestigations of the value of these clinical methods \nled to their widespread and enthusiastic adoption after \nhe published his results in 1839. These advances helped \nlead to a change in the practice of medicine. Bedside \nteaching was first introduced in the Renaissance by \nMontanus (1498–1552) in Padua in 1543. In the 17th \ncentury, physicians based their opinion on a history \nprovided by an apothecary (assistant) and rarely saw \nthe patients themselves. Thomas Sydenham (1624–89) \nbegan to practise more modern bedside medicine, \nbasing his treatment on experience and not theory, \nbut it was not until a century later that the scientific \nmethod brought a systematic approach to clinical \ndiagnosis.\nThis change began in the hospitals of Paris after the \nFrench Revolution, with recognition of the work of \nMorgagni, Corvisart, Laënnec and others. Influenced by \nthe philosophy of the Enlightenment, which suggested \nthat a rational approach to all problems was possible, the \nParis Clinical School combined physical examination \nwith autopsy as the basis of clinical medicine. The \nmethods of this school were first applied abroad in \nDublin, where Robert Graves (1796–1853) and William \nStokes worked. Later, at Guy’s Hospital in London, \nthe famous trio of Richard Bright, Thomas Addison \n(1793–1860) and Thomas Hodgkin (1798–1866) made \ntheir important contributions. In 1869 Samuel Wilks \n(1824–1911) wrote on the nail changes in disease \nand the signs he described remain important. Carl \nWunderlich’s (1815–77) work changed the concept of \ntemperature from a disease in itself to a symptom of \ndisease. Spectacular advances in physiology, pathology, \npharmacology and the discovery of microbiology in the \nlatter half of the 19th century led to the development \nof the new ‘clinical and laboratory medicine’, which \nis the rapidly advancing medicine of the present day. \nThe modern systematic approach to diagnosis, with \nwhich this book deals, is still, however, based on taking \nthe history and examining the patient by looking \n(inspecting), feeling (palpating), tapping (percussing) \nand listening (auscultating).\nSuggested reading\nReiser SJ.

HIPPOCRATES (460?–357BC)\nPRINCIPLES OF PAEDIATRIC \nHISTORY TAKING AND \nEXAMINATION\nChildren are not simply little adults: the history taking \nand physical examination of these little people needs \nto be tailored to their specific needs. Like the neonatal \nexamination (and often more so) physical examination \nin childhood is opportunistic: trying slavishly to follow \na set sequence will almost always end in frustration and \ntears for the clinician, the parents and, most importantly, \nthe child. Much of the paediatric examination is, \nhowever, identical or very similar to that of the adult. \nTo avoid unnecessary repetition, this chapter focuses \nmainly on where the paediatric examination differs \nfrom that of the adult examination.\nIn contrast to the neonatal examination, there is \nno consensus regarding the timing and regularity of \nthe paediatric examination. Many clinicians use the \nimmunisation schedule as a convenient routine for the \nevaluation of children in their care. The American \nAcademy of Paediatrics suggests that every school-aged \nchild should have a complete physical examination and \nhealth evaluation every 1–2 years.1\nThe principal aims of well-child examination in \nschool-aged children (kindergarten to early adolescence) \nare:2\n•\t promoting health\n•\t detecting disease\n•\t counselling to prevent injury and future health \nproblems.\nIt is generally accepted that children should have a \nphysical examination every time they present to a \nclinician. These examinations should not be restricted \nto the part of the body considered to be the basis of \nthe presenting complaint, although they should be \nconcentrated on that area or body system, as in adults. \nThe purpose and scope of the examination need to \nbe explained to the parents and child (particularly to \nadolescents) and should take into account their level \nof understanding. If any part of the examination \nwill be physically or psychologically uncomfortable, \nthe parents and child should be informed in \nadvance.3\nPAEDIATRIC HISTORY \nTAKING\nThe paediatric history is somewhat unique in medicine \nin that in most cases it is given by someone other than \nthe patient—this is usually one or both parents. Children \nand teenagers, however, have much to say—their input \nin the history is extremely useful. It is important to \ninvolve children in this process, but their level of \nmaturity must be taken into account. If the child is \nold enough to have some understanding of what is \ngoing on, it is best to direct simple questions to the \nchild but in many cases to expect that the parent will \nanswer or even repeat the question to the child, almost \nas an interpreter. In many cases it may be preferable \nto interview adolescents without their parents at some \npoint. Reassuring the adolescent at the start of the \nconsultation that matters discussed will be kept \nconfidential is a must.4 Equally important, however, is \nalso explaining to the adolescent when this confidentiality \nmay be broken.

Ask the family whether \nthere are any other concerns or issues that \nhaven’t been covered so far.\nGENERAL PHYSICAL \nEXAMINATION\n(For a general summary see Text box 37.2.)\nPreparing for the examination\nBefore you start the physical examination, roll up your \nsleeves to above the elbow. Hand hygiene is crucial for \nthe prevention of cross-infection and nosocomialb \ninfections. Clean your hands and forearms with \nethanol-based hand disinfectant or soap and water before \nand after contact with children, before and after any \nprocedure or exposure to bodily fluids and after touching \nthe child’s surroundings. It is generally advised that you \ndo not sit on the patient’s bed when you see the child \nas a hospital inpatient. However, a child-friendly \napproach may sometimes necessitate that this rule be \nbroken. Ideally, one should wear examination gloves \nand other personal protective equipment when indicated \nso as to avoid cross-infection. Clean your examination \ntools (e.g. stethoscope) thoroughly with appropriate \nantimicrobial agents before and after use as recommended \nby the manufacturer.\nMoving a settled, happy child from the parent’s lap \nto start an examination may cause significant distress. \nThis can make an already potentially challenging \nexamination all the more difficult! Feel free to begin \nthe examination where the child is most comfortable. \nEngaging the child with play, and establishing rapport, \nis a key first step. In an ideal situation, the child should \nbe examined undressed to his or her underwear, but \nthis may not always be possible for small children and \nmay cause significant distress to the adolescent patient. \nIt is preferable for the parents to undress the young \nchild when this is necessary.\nAlways consider examining adolescents fully clothed, \nand ask them to undress only if necessary for particular \nparts of the examination (e.g. the skin). Sometimes \ngetting the older child to change in private into a \nhospital-type gown may help. Parents should be present \nfor the examination of a child. Always offer to have a \nchaperone present for physical examination of an \nadolescent if the child does not want the parents present \nor they are absent.3\nExamination\nObservation\nMuch information can be gathered by observing the \nyoung child, either sitting in the parent’s lap or playing \non the floor. Assess the child’s state of wellbeing (does \nthe child look sick or well, under- or overnourished? \nHow active is he or she?). Note any asymmetry of \nmovement or abnormal posturing, and evaluate the \nchild’s skin colour and breathing pattern. Observe the \nway the child interacts with the parents and with other \npeople.\nTake time to allow the child to become acquainted \nand comfortable with you. As mentioned, much of the \nexamination can be performed with the child in the \nparent’s lap—usually the place where the child is likely \nto feel the most safe. Be prepared to play with, be silly \nwith and interact with the child in a friendly, calm and \nquiet manner wherever possible. Some age-appropriate \ntoys (well cleaned between patients) can be very helpful; \nwhen all else fails, using a bubble wand to blow a few \nwell-timed bubbles should soothe and win over even \nthe most upset child. Never forget to warm your hands \nbefore touching a child.\nWhereas the young child may be most comfortable \non the parent’s lap, slightly older children usually sit \nb\t This means an infection acquired when a person is under medical \ncare—usually in hospital.\n",

Lastly, if \nin the hospital setting, much can be gained by a quick \nglance and visual exploration of the room, especially \nfor children and teenagers with chronic medical \nconditions or prolonged hospital stays.\nMeasurements\nIn addition to documenting the child’s weight, height \nand head circumference at the well-child examinations, \nit is prudent to check and document these measurements \nevery time the child presents for review. These \nmeasurements are crucially important for the detection \nof serious pathologies and the monitoring of growth \nand development. Plot the results on the appropriate \ngrowth charts: it is generally standard practice to use \ngender-specific, height-for-age, weight-for-age and \nhead-circumference charts (see Fig. 37.1). There are \nspecial growth charts for children with certain \nsyndromic diagnoses (e.g. Down’s syndrome).\nFor children who do not walk, recumbent length \nis measured rather than height. A sitting height can \nalso be useful in some situations (see below). It is best \nto use a stable, accurate, fixed measuring device \nwherever possible.\nFor an accurate weight to be determined, children \nshould be undressed (underwear for older children; \nnappy for infants). The nappy weight needs to be \nconsidered when calculating the accurate weight. Also \ndo not forget to remove the child’s shoes and socks.\nA method for measuring an accurate head \ncircumference is outlined in Chapter 38. It may be \nimportant to measure the head circumference of both \nparents if benign familial macrocephaly is suspected. \nHead shape and craniosynostosis are explained later \nin this chapter.\nBody mass index (BMI; see Ch 3) and waist \ncircumference are used less in children than in adults, \nbut can be useful tools, particularly in adolescents. \nBMI and growth velocity centile charts are available \nfrom the World Health Organization and should be \nused wherever possible. Recent studies suggest that \nwaist circumference may be more useful than BMI \nfor the assessment of Indigenous children.5\nOther anthropometric measurements that may be \nuseful, particularly in children who are at risk of growth \nfailure (e.g. children with feeding difficulties, chronic \nillness or social difficulties), include mid-upper arm \ncircumference and skinfold measurements, although \nthese are rarely performed in routine practice.\nMid-upper arm circumference: first remove any \nclothing that may be covering the child’s arm. Estimate \nthe midpoint of the arm and use a tape measure to \ndetermine the circumference. This is usually easier with \nthe arm lying flat against the patient’s side and with \nthe tape neither too tight nor too loose. A measurement \nof less than 11 centimetres in a child over 6 months \nold usually indicates malnutrition.6\nSkinfold measurements: these are usually taken from \nthe triceps and subscapular region. Using a skinfold \ncalliper, measure the thickness of a fold of skin and \nunderlying subcutaneous tissue (not muscle; see Fig. \n37.2). Skinfold measurements can be compared with \npopulation averages.\nText continued on p 633\nMeasuring the triceps skinfold \n(From Wilson SF, Giddens JF.

This is \nparticularly important if there are concerns that the \nchild may have short stature (e.g. caused by a \n‘chondroplasic’ disorder). For example, a child with \n‘achrondroplasia’ may have a normal sitting height, \nbut have a marked reduction in standing height. \nGenerally, at birth the normal upper-to-lower segment \nratio is 1.7 : 1 and by the age of 10 the segments should \nbe equal (and remain so into adulthood).7\nMeasurement of upper and lower segment lengths: \nthe lower segment is measured from the symphysis \npubis to the floor in the standing child; to calculate \nthe upper segment, subtract the lower segment length \nfrom the total height.\nIn most children with short stature the cause is \nhereditary short stature, so parental height should \nalways be taken into account. As with other growth \nparameters, if a child’s height was previously within a \nhealthy range and is now crossing height centiles \ndownwards this is usually more cause for concern \nthan a child who has followed the same, albeit lower, \ncentile.\nA wide range of diagnoses are associated with \nshort stature, including nutritional deficiencies \n(see below), chromosomal abnormalities (such as \ntrisomy 21 or Turner’s syndrome), skeletal dysplasias \n(such as achondroplasia), metabolic disorders (e.g. \nHunter’s or Hurler’s syndrome), endocrinopathies \n(such as hypothyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome or \nprimary pituitary disease) and iatrogenic causes \n(such as craniospinal irradiation in childhood for \nmalignancy).\nPathological tall stature is less common, but causes \ninclude Klinefelter’s syndrome, Marfan’s syndrome, \ngigantism, thyrotoxicosis and Beckwith–Wiedemann \nsyndrome.\nVital signs\nThese (blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rates, \ntemperature) should be measured at each presentation, \nparticularly if the child is unwell.\nBlood pressure\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends \nroutine blood pressure measurements for children from \nthe age of 3 years.8 The blood pressure cuff should be \nappropriate for the child’s size (the width of the cuff \nbladder should equal 40% of the mid-upper arm \ncircumference; see Fig. 37.3(a) and (b)).9 It is best \nmeasured after the child has been sitting quietly for 5 \nminutes, although this is seldom possible in practice. \nAn automatic sphygmomanometer is often used for \nscreening, but auscultation is more precise. Listen with \nthe diaphragm of the stethoscope over the brachial \nartery pulse, proximal and medial to the cubital fossa \n(see Fig. 37.3(c)). Systolic pressure is indicated by the \nappearance of the first Korotkoff sound and diastolic \nby the fifth Korotkoff sound (the cessation of all sound) \n(pp 82, 669).\nHypertension is not common in children and is \nusually indicative of an underlying disease, such as \nrenal disease or cardiovascular disease. However, \nprimary hypertension is increasingly seen in morbidly \nobese children and adolescents.10 One should compare \na patient’s systolic and diastolic measurements with \nFor males:\n(\n)\nmother’s height in cm\nfather’s height in cm\ncm\n+\n+13\n2\nFor females:\n(\n)\nmother’s height in cm\nfather’s height in cm\ncm\n+\n−13\n2\nTall and short stature\nOnce a child’s height (or length) is accurately measured \nand plotted, three further considerations need to \ntake place: (1) is the child tall or short (above or below \nthe upper / lower centiles for age and sex), (2) what is \nthe trend or trajectory over time, and (3) what are the \nbiological parents’ heights?\nThe mid-parental height can be determined to give \nan idea of the child’s growth potential:\n",

Pediatric clinical skills. Philadelphia: \nSaunders, 2010.)\nMany benign skin lesions are commonly seen in \nchildhood (e.g. warts, epidermal cysts, pyogenic \ngranulomata) and require no specific treatment. Bruising \nin babies is an unexpected finding and requires further \ninvestigation (e.g. coagulopathy, non-accidental injury). \nAlthough below-knee bruising in cruisingc children is \nmore common, this should prompt concerns if the bruises \nare located in atypical areas such as the buttocks, hands \nand trunk and a plausible mechanism is not identified. \n(See later in the chapter regarding examination for \nsuspected child abuse.)\nPalpate the skin to feel for areas of rough, dry skin. \nEczema typically presents on the face in an infant, the \nextensor surfaces in a young child and the flexor \nsurfaces in an older child. Examine the groin, \nparticularly if the child is still in nappies (nappy rash \nor napkin dermatitis).\nLook for vascular lesions (ask the parents about \n‘birthmarks’), which, although relatively common, may \nbe of clinical significance. Infantile haemangiomas are \nbenign vascular tumours (see Fig. 37.13) that have a \nperiod of growth (proliferation) but eventually (over \n90%) self-resolve (involute) spontaneously by the time \nthe child is 9 years old. Thus, they do not require \ntreatment unless they are extensive, increase in size or \nare in a problematic area (e.g. perioral, periorbital, \nanogenital, laryngeal).19 These lesions need to be \ndifferentiated from vascular malformations, which \nneither proliferate nor involute (see Table 37.6).\nThe presence of cervicofacial or more than five \ncutaneous haemangiomas may indicate the presence \nof airway or visceral haemangiomas. The infantile \nvascular lesions associated with Sturge–Weber \nsyndrome and Klippel–Trenaunay syndrome are \ndetailed in Chapter 38, but remember that these vascular \nlesions grow in proportion to the child and often require \ntreatment.\nMalignant skin lesions (squamous cell carcinomas, \nbasal cell carcinomas, melanomas) are very uncommon \nScaling\nAccumulation of desquamating skin cells \n(e.g. ichthyosis)\nCrusts\nAccumulations of dried exudates or \ntransudate (e.g. infected eczema)\nExcoriations\nLinear breaks in the skin (e.g. scratches \nseen in scabies)\nFissures\nLinear cracks in the skin (e.g. cracked \nheels)\nErosions\nCircumscribed loss of the superficial layer\nUlcer\nCircumscribed loss of tissue that extends \ninto the dermis to subcutaneous tissue \nor even deeper\nAtrophy\nThinning of the skin layers (e.g. \npostradiation skin changes)\nScars\nFibrous tissue repairs of skin that has \nbeen damaged below the level of the \nepidermis\nTABLE 37.5 \nSecondary skin lesions\n(Modified from Goldbloom RB.

As these abnormalities \nmay be associated with complications that affect the \nsensory, respiratory and neurological systems, it is \nimportant that they are recognised early and referred for \ntreatment.22\nPalpate over the skull for bony lumps (e.g. exostoses) \nand soft-tissue lumps (e.g. haemangiomas or cysts). \nPalpate the fontanels if still open (see Ch 38).\nExamine the neck. As well as palpating for lymph \nnodes (see later in this chapter), look for cervical masses \nsuch as cystic hygromas, thyroglossal cysts or \nepidermoid cysts, which present with painless, soft or \nsemifirm swellings. Thyroglossal cysts are most \ncommonly localised in the midline at or below the \nlevel of the hyoid bone and move upwards when the \ntongue is protruded.23 Epidermoid cysts are found on \nthe floor of the mouth and superior to the hyoid bone.\nLook for a webbed neck, which suggests Turner’s \nsyndrome (see Fig. 37.21) or Noonan’s syndrome; if \nfound, look for decreased lateral rotation, which is seen \nin both syndromes. A short neck may be seen in several \nsyndromes (e.g. Hurler’s syndrome and Klippel–Feil \nsyndrome) as well as in congenital hypothyroidism.\nFinally, palpate for the thyroid gland. This lies on \neither side of the trachea, below the thyroid cartilage, \nand is best felt by standing behind the patient and \nplacing your hands gently on either side of the patient’s \nneck. Ask the patient to swallow and the thyroid will \nmove upwards. This is really only possible in the older \ncooperative child, however; it can be very difficult to \nexamine the neck of an infant owing to the relative \nsize of the head compared with the neck. Also, not \nsurprisingly, small children usually will not tolerate an \nexaminer standing behind them putting their hands \naround their neck! Try to examine the thyroid with \nthe patient sitting and facing you if that approach is \nmore likely to be successful.\nEar, nose and throat\nIt is particularly important to be proficient in the ear, \nnose and throat (ENT) examination as infections in \nthese organs are some of the most common presentations \nfor children. This is a key skill in the paediatric \nexamination.\nLook at the size, shape and position of the ears. \nCheck for malformations and any preauricular tags or \npits, which can be associated with hearing loss but are \nusually benign. Palpate over the tragus and pinna, \nwhich may be tender if the child has otitis externa, \nand over the mastoid behind the ear if mastoiditis is \nsuspected. Mastoiditis, if present, may also push the \npinna of the ear forwards, giving the child a lop-sided \nappearance. Infection and inflammation of the skin of \nthe ears and the ear canal (e.g. eczema, bacterial or \nfungal otitis externa) are quite common. Children are \nalso predisposed to middle ear infections. A hyperaemic \n(red), inflamed, bulging tympanic membrane, with loss \nof the light reflex (see Ch 32, Fig. 42.16), may signify \nacute otitis media (AOM) (also called otitis media \nwith effusion—OME; see Ch 42). While genetic, \ninfectious, immunological and environmental factors \nall play a role in this predisposition, the shape of the \neustachian tube itself, which is shorter and less angled \nin children (see Fig. 37.22), means that it is easier for \norganisms to migrate from the nasopharynx to the \nmiddle ear and more difficult for the middle ear to \ndrain.22\nAlthough otoscopy should not hurt unless it is done \nincorrectly, it can be quite upsetting for younger \nchildren and is best performed while they are seated \non their parent’s lap—and at the end of the examination. \nIf necessary, have the parent lock the child’s lower limbs \nsecurely between their thighs (or even wrap a leg across \nthe child’s legs) and use his or her arms to embrace \nthe child warmly, holding them tight against their chest, \nWebbed neck in Turner’s syndrome \n(From Bouloux PM.

Tips for \notoscopes come in various sizes; use one that fits \ncomfortably in the ear canal but also allows visualisation \nof the drum. Generally, to visualise the ear canal and \neardrum adequately, gently pull the pinna downwards \nif the child is under the age of 2 years, and upwards \nand backwards if older than 2 years.7 Take note of the \near canal as the otoscope enters the ear. Look for \nswelling and erythema. Bear in mind that earwax can \nbuild up in the canal and make visualisation of the \ntympanic membrane difficult or even impossible.\nFinally, examine the eardrum itself (see Figs 37.24 \nand 37.25). Normally, this is a pale-pink colour, \nalthough previous infections and perforations can cause \nscarring. If the eustachian tube is blocked, the drum \nmay be under negative pressure and may be retracted \naway from you. Retraction is also seen in chronic otitis \nmedia with effusion. If there is pus behind the drum, \nas in acute otitis media, it can take on a red or yellow \ncolour and may be bulging.\nExamine the shape and position of the nose, and \nlook for signs of inflammation and rhinorrhoea. Palpate \nover the bony and cartilaginous surfaces of the nose \nfeeling for lumps, pain and swelling. Look inside the \nnose. If there is pain, look for lesions or ulcers. Look \nfor blood and the site of haemorrhage (often a large \nvessel is seen in ‘Little’s area’ in children with recurrent \nChild\ndrum\ndrum\nAdult\nComparison of the eustachian tubes in \nchildren and adults \n(From Hockenberry MJ, Wilson D.

In a general paediatrics setting, \nan otoscope can be used for this, and if a more detailed \nexamination is required then referral to an ENT surgeon \nis necessary for nasal endoscopy.\nExamination of the mouth and throat is fundamental \nin paediatrics and is one of the most common \nexaminations in everyday practice. Again, the best place \nfor this examination is with the child sitting in the \nparent’s lap. It is usually best to position the child facing \nforwards with one of the parent’s arms across the child’s \narms and the other hand on the child’s forehead, \npreventing the child’s head from moving.

Features from \nthe history and examination can guide diagnosis; for \nexample, normal-looking muscle bulk (or even \npseudohypertrophy, particularly of the calves) coupled \nwith decreased muscle tone and strength may indicate \nDuchenne’s or Becker’s muscular dystrophy.\nIf weakness is found during the physical examination, \nan attempt should be made to differentiate between an \nupper motor neurone (UMN) lesion, which usually \npresents with hypertonia, hyperreflexia, clonus, \nspasticity and a positive Babinski’s sign (after the age \nof 1 year), and a lower motor neurone (LMN) lesion, \nwhere the child has hypotonia and hyporeflexia.20 \nFor infants, this differentiation is described as ‘floppy \nFor older children: test as you would for an adult, \nincluding Weber’s and Rinne’s tests if appropriate (see \nCh 32).\nCN IX and X (glossopharyngeal and vagus)\nFor infants:\nObserve the palate if (when) the child cries at \nany stage during the examination.\nListen for b, d and k sounds when the child is \nspeaking, as children with defective palate \nmovement often have difficulty producing \nthese sounds.\nFor older children:\nIn practice, this is usually limited to asking the \nchild to open up and say ‘Ah’ and observing \npalate movements.\nAgain, listen for b, d and k sounds when the \nchild is speaking.\nIt is not recommended to test routinely for the gag \nreflex in children unless there is a history \nsuggestive of swallowing difficulties or palate \ndysfunction. Be aware that children with a \nsensitive gag reflex may well vomit during this \nprocedure.\nCN XI (spinal accessory)\nFor infants:\nLay the infant supine on an examination table, \nwith your arm underneath the shoulders \nproviding support.

In the \nsmaller child, many paediatricians place their finger \nover the tendon and tap on that with the tendon \nhammer, rather than risk hurting the child.\nThere are some excellent videos detailing the \npaediatric neurological exam at http://library.med\n.utah.edu/pedineurologicexam/html/introduction.html.\nDevelopmental assessment\nThe developmental assessment is what truly differentiates \nthe paediatric examination from examination of the \nadult. The developmental kit, with all its amusing \ntoys and paraphernalia, clearly separates paediatric \ndoctors from their adult colleagues with their boring \nbriefcases.\nDevelopmental assessment is increasingly important \nin paediatrics as it has evolved from acute care, \nparticularly the treatment of infectious diseases, to ‘a \nnear revolution of successful preventive care measures \nthat have improved the health and prognosis of children \nand created the expectation of longer, safer lives’.26 \nAdded to this are the increasing numbers of surviving \nextremely premature infants, for whom disability, \nranging in severity, is not uncommon. The care of \nchildren with developmental disabilities remains a major \nchallenge, requiring regular follow-up and early \nintervention to maximise outcomes.27\n1.\tThe 180° examination: Begin with the infant or \nsmall child lying supine on a firm surface.\nNote the resting posture and positioning and \nlook for movement of the arms and legs \n(voluntary and involuntary), symmetry of \nmovements and general level of alertness.\n2.\t‘Scarf sign’: take the child’s hand and pull it \n(gently) across his or her chest so that the elbow \nis underneath the chin.\nThis tests appendicular tone in the shoulders, \nbut remember that this is also reflective of the \nchild’s level of alertness (a child in a deep sleep \nmay appear to have lower tone).\nIn the hypotonic child the elbow can be easily \npulled beyond the middle line with minimal \nresistance.\n3.\t‘Pull to sit’: grasp the child’s hands and pull the \nchild gently into a sitting position.\nThis tests axial tone of the neck and back and \nappendicular tone of the shoulder and arms.\nNormal newborns will have a head lag, but \nthis should not be present after 2–3 months of \nage (always remember to use the corrected age \nfor premature infants, who may have lower tone \nthan term infants).\n4.\t‘Shoulder suspension’: lift the child up by holding \nhim or her under the arms.\nThis gives an indication of head control, \nappendicular tone and strength. It is also useful \nfor looking for scissoring of the lower limbs, \nwhich is seen in cerebral palsy.\nThe hypotonic child tends to slip through \nyour hands (take particular care when \nperforming this procedure).\nWhile performing this manoeuvre, it is also \nuseful to ‘stand’ the child up on the flat surface. \nThis helps to demonstrate hypotonia and \nweakness, but also inappropriate early \nweight-bearing, as seen in children with UMN \nlesions (as in cerebral palsy).\n5.\t‘Ventral suspension’: lift the child up and hold \nhim or her with a hand under the chest and \nabdomen.\nAgain, this gives an idea of head control and \nappendicular tone and strength.\nWith severe hypotonia, the child adopts a \nfloppy ‘C’ shape.

Do they know colours, animals, parts \nof the face? Do they point to things they want, things \nthey are interested in, things they want to share with \nyou? The answers to these questions can then guide \nthe developmental examination.\nVision is relatively easy to assess: hold out a toy for \na small child to fix on and follow. If the child’s response \nappears normal, place much smaller items in the palm \nof your hand for the child to see, reach for and grasp \n(the classic is to use hundreds-and-thousands). For \nolder children, ask him or her to read aloud from a \nbook. Very young infants often prefer a face—yours \nor the parents’—rather than a toy.\nAssessing hearing in an infant or a small child is \na little more tricky and requires a cooperative child, \npreferably held in the parent’s lap, and an assistant with \na toy that makes a noise (like a bell or a squeaky toy). \nHave the assistant stand behind the child out of the \nchild’s line of sight. Distract the child using a toy that \ndoes not make any noise and, once you are sure you \nhave the child’s attention, hide this toy behind your \nback. The assistant should then make a sound with the \nnoisy toy next to the child’s ear. Note whether the child’s \nexpression changes or the child turns towards the sound. \nCheck each ear in turn. In an older child, you should \nhave an idea of the child’s level of hearing from speaking \nand interacting with him or her throughout the \nexamination.\nFine-motor skill is usually assessed next. If the child \nwas able to grasp the hundreds-and-thousands in the \nvisual test, this indicates that the child has a pincer \ngrip. Watching the child play will also give you an idea \nof fine-motor skills: shaking a rattle, stacking blocks, \nthreading beads on a string, rolling a ball and miming \neating using a knife and fork are all good tests of \nfine-motor skills.\nMoving on to gross-motor skills, consider checking \nthe primitive reflexes in an infant (see Ch 38) and \ncomplete the 180° examination described earlier. In \nan older child, the standard gait examination can be \nused to assess gross-motor skills.\nFinally, summarise your findings and determine \nwhether there is isolated delay or global delay. \nRemember to always ask the parents whether there are \nany particular areas of development that they are \nconcerned about.\nAlthough it is not expected that every doctor who \nexamines children should be able to complete a full \ndevelopmental assessment, it is imperative that doctors \nwho regularly examine children are familiar with the \ncommon developmental milestones and can quickly \nand accurately assess for delay.\nRemember that development progresses in an \norderly fashion from cephalic to caudal: head control \nprecedes trunk control, which in turn progresses to \nstanding and eventually to locomotion. Many assessment \ntools are used to monitor development. Most extremely \npremature infants are now monitored at regular intervals \nusing the Bayley Scales of Infant Development or the \nGriffiths Scale. These and many other assessment tools \ntake into account four key fields: gross motor, fine \nmotor (including vision), speech (including hearing), \nand social and interpersonal development. Delays in \nany of these areas should be cause for concern and \nrequire follow-up and possibly referral to appropriate \nservices. Generally, however, manipulative or fine-motor \ndevelopment is more important than gross-motor \ndevelopment. A child’s level of alertness and interest \nin his or her surroundings is most important in the \nassessment of cognition.28\nMuch of the developmental assessment can be \ncompleted by observation: watch how the child plays \nwith toys; watch their interaction with other children, \nfamily and clinicians. In this way it can be easier to \ngauge children’s social development by the way they \ninteract with their parents, with you and with their \nsurroundings. Listen for any vocalisations or words \nthat children make throughout the examination, \nwhether they can follow any commands given and make \nnote of any of their interactions with you (smiling, \nwaving, pushing you away, etc.).\nDevelopmental examination\nBegin the formal part of the developmental assessment \nby testing vision and hearing, as the assessment will need \nto be modified extensively if these senses are impaired. \nBefore starting, some developmental milestones may \nbe elicited on history: can the infant roll, sit, crawl, \npull to stand, cruise or walk independently? Can the \ninfant suck his or her fist, reach for objects, swap objects \nfrom hand to hand, feed self, stack blocks, wave? Can \nthe infant understand simple words like ‘yes’, ‘no’, \n‘milk’, ‘mummy’? How many words do infants have; \ncan they put two or three words together; can they \n",

This is usually assumed to be \nthe cause of a great variety of persistent ENT or \nrespiratory problems but, except for obstructive sleep \napnoea,g a causal relationship between these immune \norgans and illness is poorly established. Thus, always \nexplore the sleeping history, particularly whether \nsymptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea such as loud \nsnoring and abnormal breathing or breathing efforts \nduring sleep have been observed by the parents. \nThis problem is sometimes associated with daytime \nsomnolence and behavioural problems.\nExamination: lymphadenopathy (small, <1 cm, \nnon-tender, freely mobile lymph nodes) is extremely \ncommon in younger children, particularly in the head \nand neck region (see List 37.1).29\nThe location of the lymphadenopathy will often \ngive a clue to its aetiology.

      "text": "CHAPTER 37  The paediatric history and examination\t\n665\nFainting (syncope) and dizziness are not uncommon \nsymptoms in older children (see Questions box 37.3).\nPalpitations may have been noticed by the child, \nor the parents may have found an abnormal heart rate \n(see Questions box 37.4).\nMost importantly, beware of the three Cs of serious \ninfection and illness:\n•\t Concerns from the parents that the current \nillness is different from previous illnesses (if \nmum says he is sick, he is sick)\n•\t Changes in behaviour by the child (e.g. crying, \ndrowsiness, moaning or inconsolability)\n•\t your Clinical instinct that something is wrong.\nExamination\nThe respiratory and cardiovascular examination is of \nparticular significance in paediatrics because it can \ndetect clinical features that identify a seriously ill child \n(see Table 37.11). Note that some important warning \nsigns are already found in the history and on careful \ninspection. Palpation (starting with the hands and \nproceeding in an opportunistic fashion) and auscultation \nare usually done next. Sometimes, in a quiet, sleeping \nX-ray, suggests the possibility of aspiration, abnormal \nimmune function or suppurative lung disease. Ask \nabout associated problems, such as:\n•\t poor weight gain, steatorrhoea (cystic fibrosis)\n•\t severe infections of other tissues such as \nmeningitis, skin, intra-abdominal abscesses or \nosteomyelitis (immunoglobulin deficiency)\n•\t detection of unusual pathogens such as \nPneumocystis jiroveci (previously carinii), Serratia \nmarcescens, Candida (e.g. cellular immune \ndeficiency) and Aspergillus.\nAsk about rapid breathing (tachypnoea) or difficult \nbreathing (dyspnoea). These are important features of \nrespiratory distress, which is a common indicator of \na respiratory, cardiac or circulatory problem in children. \nIn young infants particularly there may also be \nneurological and metabolic causes (see Ch 38). \nRespiratory distress may rapidly worsen and result in \nlife-threatening respiratory failure (type 1: hypoxia with \nnormocapnia; type 2: hypoxia and hypercapnia) or \ncardiocirculatory failure (inadequate tissue perfusion; \nsee Table 37.11).\nAsk the parents of small infants about feeding \nduration (normally less than 20 minutes), frequency \n(6–8 times per day in fully breastfed or bottle-fed babies) \nand fluid intake (normally 100–150 mL / kg per 24 hours \nof oral feeds in infants of less than 10 kg).\nParents may have noticed squatting (rare nowadays) \nin children with cyanotic heart defects because this \nposition improves systemic oxygen saturation by \nreducing the right-to-left shunt. Ask about cyanosis, \nalthough this can be difficult for parents to recognise. \nHypercyanotic (blue) spells are easily recognised \nmedical emergencies and always require specialist \ninvolvement in the long-term management.\nIf chest pain has been the problem, careful \nquestioning can help in the assessment (see Questions \nbox 37.2).\nBreathlessness during exercise raises the possibility \nof heart disease. If the onset is recent, a cardiomyopathy \nor episode of myocarditis is a possibility. Gradually \nworsening symptoms may indicate congenital heart \ndisease. Shortness of breath directly after physical \nactivity in association with respiratory noises (cough, \nwheeze) is a typical symptom of exercise-induced \nasthma.\nQUESTIONS TO ASK THE CHILD WITH \nCHEST PAIN\n1.\t What is the pain like? Is it sharp and worse \nwhen you take big breaths? (Pleuritic or \nsometimes muscular pain) Is it stabbing? \n(Musculoskeletal) Is it dull and heavy? \n(Myocardial ischaemia—very rare in \nchildren)\n2.\t Where do you feel the pain? (Left- or \nright-sided pain is unlikely to be cardiac)\n3.\t Does the pain go to anywhere else? (To \nthe back with aortic dissection or \nmusculoskeletal pain)\n4.\t How bad is it?

Coincidentally, a young \nsurgical technician named Vivien Thomas in Dr Blalock’s laboratory had \nalready performed this work successfully in dogs. He stood behind Blalock \nduring the first surgery performed in a 15-month-old girl with tetralogy \nof Fallot in 1944 to provide procedural advice.

Check for dental caries and pallor \nwhile inspecting the oral cavity. Pallor can also be \ndetected by inspecting the conjunctivae and palmar \ncreases. Common causes of pallor include:\n•\t low haemoglobin levels (with increased pulse \nrate)\n•\t poor cardiac output (weak pulse, prolonged \ncapillary refill and sometimes bradycardia).\nThere may be koilonychia if the cause is iron deficiency, \nhypertension if the cause is renal disease, or a recent \nhistory of erythema infectiosum (‘fifth disease’) with \nbone marrow suppression.\nClubbing is present when there is an increase in \nthe angle between the nail and the skin overlying the \ndistal phalanx (>160°).7 This is caused by proliferation \nof subungual tissue at the root of the nail and can \neasily be detected when it exceeds 180° by holding \nboth thumbs back to back with the fingertips and \ninterphalangeal joints aligned.

S1 is not split except above the tricuspid \narea where it may be closely split. S2 is produced by \nclosure of the aortic (A2) and pulmonary (P2) valves. \nS2 is split in inspiration but there is no split or only \na close split in expiration above the pulmonary area.\nInnocent systolic (between S1 and S2) vibratory \nejection murmurs are common (Still’s murmur) and \nhave a musical character (like twanging a piece of tense \nstring). There are also systolic flow ejection murmurs, \nwhich are not musical (medium-pitched) but they are \nnever harsh or coarse. They may be innocent if S2 is \nnormal. They are also heard with atrial septal defect \n(ASD) (p 77), but then there is also a fixed splitting \nof S2.\nAbnormal\n1.\tHeart sounds.

This causes \ndissociation between closure of the valve leaflets \nand ventricle contractions. This sign can be \nuseful in distinguishing complete heart block \nfrom sinus bradycardia.\nAn absent or faint S1 is found when the PR \ninterval is prolonged. A fixed split of S2 is found \nwith ASD and pulmonary valve stenosis. \nHowever, ASD is associated with a systolic flow \nmurmur (medium-pitched), while pulmonary \nvalve stenosis leads to a systolic obstructive \nmurmur (low-pitched, harsh, coarse).\nsystolic blood pressure during inspiration \n(greater than 10 mmHg). On palpation, the \npulses are fainter during inspiration and this can \nbe found with severe airways obstruction (e.g. in \nasthma or croup) or reduced left ventricular \nfilling (e.g. cardiac tamponade or pericarditis). It \nmust be quantified with a stethoscope and blood \npressure cuff.\nThe femoral pulses must be checked at some stage but \nin chubby babies this requires patience. Thus, feel the \ngroins only towards the end of the examination. Absence \nof the femoral pulses or a radiofemoral delay raises \nsuspicion of the presence of aortic coarctation.\nTest the capillary refill time by pressing your index \nfinger onto the child’s chest for 5 seconds. This inhibits \nskin perfusion and leaves a pale area, which should \nregain its colour (refill) within 2–3 seconds. A prolonged \ncapillary refill indicates poor peripheral perfusion, \nwhich is most commonly caused by:\n•\t septicaemia\n•\t dehydration, or\n•\t heart failure.\nAssess the location and quality of the impulse of the \napex beat, which should be located in the fourth \nintercostal space approximately on the left midclavicular \nline. Feel for a vibration under your right hand held \nonto the left lower sternal border (ventricular septal \ndefect, VSD) and left upper sternal edge (pulmonary \nvalve stenosis).

With a grade 4 murmur a \nthrill is also palpable and with a grade 6 murmur you \nwould not need a stethoscope to hear it. Importantly, \ninnocent murmurs are not loud and never have a thrill \n(see below).\nTiming of the occurrence of the sound or \nmurmur in the cardiac cycle\nA systolic regurgitant murmur (usually high-pitched, \nblowing) commences immediately with S1 and concludes \nonly with S2 (pan- or holosystolic); for example, it is \nobserved in mitral or tricuspid valve regurgitation. \nIn contrast, systolic obstructive ejection murmurs \n(low-pitched, harsh) commence after S1 (small pause \nbetween S1 and murmur). They have a crescendo–\ndecrescendo occurrence, meaning that their intensity \nincreases and then decreases before S2. Ejection \nmurmurs can occur in early, mid or late systole and \nare heard with, for instance, aortic and pulmonary valve \nstenosis. Diastolic regurgitant murmurs commence with \nS2 and are high-pitched with aortic regurgitation (high \npressure gradient) and low-pitched with pulmonary \nregurgitation (low pressure gradient) but they are not \npandiastolic. In contrast, diastolic obstructive murmurs \ncommence after S2 and have a crescendo–decrescendo \noccurrence. In mitral valve stenosis, they occur in late \ndiastole and have a low-pitched rumbling character. \nThere are also occasionally short mid-diastolic flow \nmurmurs (medium-pitched) in severe VSD, ASD, \ntricuspid or mitral valve regurgitation due to markedly \nincreased flow volume.\nMany healthy children have a heart murmur and \nseveral types of innocent murmurs are reported (see \nTable 37.13). Innocent murmurs are not harsh and occur \nin systole but are not pansystolic. They are not loud \nand they may further diminish in intensity in different \npositions. Usually they are localised with no radiation \nexcept for the pulmonary branch murmur of infancy. \nPatients with murmurs with these characteristics can \nusually be reassured, especially if there are no cardiac \nsymptoms. In neonates, however, the absence of a \nmurmur never excludes structural heart disease.\nPathological murmurs may be due to congenital \nor acquired heart defects (<1% in the general \npopulation). If they are not recognised and treated \nthey can lead to progressive limitation and premature \ndeath. Consider the following features suggestive of \npathological murmurs:\nA third heart sound (S3) can be found in \nnormal children with hyperdynamic circulation, \nbut a fourth heart sound (S4) is always abnormal.\n2.\tMurmurs. A systolic regurgitant murmur is \nnon-musical and has a high-pitched sound \ncharacter like breath sounds or blowing. A \nsystolic ejection murmur due to valvular stenosis \nis also non-musical but low-pitched, meaning it \nsounds harsh or coarse, and is usually quite loud \nand easily heard. Almost any diastolic murmur \nor continuous murmur is pathological except for \na venous hum. A venous hum arises from the \nneck and disappears when the patient is supine \nor when gentle pressure is applied to the base of \nthe neck.\n3.\tClicks and rubs. Clicks at the beginning of systole \ndirectly after S1 are generated by the opening of \nthe heart valves and are heard in aortic or \npulmonary stenosis. A midsystolic click is \npathognomonic for mitral valve prolapse.\nA pericardial friction rub is a scratchy sound \nheard at the left sternal border and usually has \none systolic and two diastolic components. It can \noccur with pericarditis or after cardiac surgery. A \nmediastinal crunch (Hamman’s sign: a crackly, \ncrunchy, bubbly sound) can be heard with \nmediastinal emphysemai after chest injury or \nthoracic surgery.\nArea where the sound is the loudest\nThe suggested sequence of auscultation is the mitral, \ntricuspid, pulmonary and aortic areas with the \ndiaphragm of the stethoscope first to detect high- and \nmedium-pitched murmurs and then in the reverse \ndirection with the bell for low-pitched murmurs.\nRadiation of the sound into other areas\nA thrill in the suprasternal notch may be palpable in \naortic stenosis. The harsh systolic obstructive murmur \nfound with pulmonary valve stenosis radiates into \nthe back, whereas the high-pitched blowing systolic \nregurgitant murmur with mitral valve regurgitation \nmay be auscultated in the axilla.\nDegree or intensity of the loudness \nof the sound or murmur\nThis can be measured by grading the loudness from 1 \nto 6 for systolic and 1 to 4 for diastolic murmurs.

In older children they are \nvesicular. Vesicular breath sounds are low-pitched and \nsoft and louder and longer in inspiration. Listen for \nreduced breath sounds (for causes see Ch 38). Bronchial \nbreath sounds are high-pitched, loud and more \nprominent in expiration. They can normally be heard \nover the trachea but not over healthy lung areas. They \nmay be heard over consolidated lungs.\nProlonged expiration is a sign of lower airway \nobstruction and is characteristic of asthma. Prolonged \ninspiration is characteristic of viral croup (infectious \nlaryngotracheitis). These children also have stridor due \nto upper airway obstruction and collapse (for other \ncauses of stridor, see Ch 38).\nIf stridor is audible during inspiration and \nexpiration, it is an ominous sign indicating severe \nobstruction or obstruction at multiple sites with the \npotential to progress rapidly to complete airway \nobstruction and death.\nGrunting is produced at the start of expiration when \nair is forced against a closed glottis to prevent small-airway \ncollapse. It is heard in association with respiratory distress. \nWheeze is more high-pitched and musical sounding and \nmay be monophonic or polyphonic. Wheeze is usually \nheard during expiration and is associated with lower \nairway obstruction (e.g. asthma in older children). If an \ninfant presents with wheeze, coryza, signs of respiratory \ndistress and inspiratory fine crackles it is suggestive \nof a virus-induced infection of the terminal airways \n(bronchiolitis), which causes small-airway obstruction, \nlung hyperinflation and collapsed lung areas. These are \noften mistaken for consolidation.\nThe diagnosis of asthma is difficult to make in \nyoung children, even if they present with apparently \ntypical features (episodic wheeze, cough and shortness \nof breath). First, young children are more prone to \nwheeze when they have a respiratory virus infection \n(e.g. bronchiolitis in the first 2 years of life). Half \nof them will outgrow this predisposition by the age \nof 3 years. Second, children born with hypoplastic \nlungs and airways as a result of maternal smoking \nduring pregnancy or of prematurity are prone to \nthese symptoms but improve as their lungs grow. \nThird, there are many other causes of wheeze in early \nlife, including structural airway anomalies such as \nbroncho- and tracheomalacia, and cystic fibrosis.

The external genitalia should be \ninspected routinely in young children so that important \nabnormalities such as testicular torsion, undescended \ntestes and penile malformations are not missed. A \ntoddler may be unwilling to lie flat and may become \nupset if you (or the parent) try to insist. Young children \nmay, however, sit quietly in the parent’s lap and let the \nparent proceed with undressing them. Remember that \nrather than the crying agile toddler, it is the unusually \nit is sensible to consider a wide range of differential \ndiagnoses if severe and frequent wheezy illnesses occur, \nunless a compelling case for asthma can be made \nbased on clinical presentation and response to specific \ntreatment.1\nCrackles are non-musical interrupted lung sounds \nof short duration that may occur at any time during \ninspiration or expiration. Crackles may be high-pitched \n(fine) or of variable pitch (coarse). They are produced \nby abrupt opening of closed airways during inspiration.32 \nThis means that crackles heard during early inspiration \noriginate from the abrupt opening of larger airways, \nwhereas those generated during late inspiration come \nfrom the terminal bronchioli or alveoli and are a sign \nof bronchiolitis, pneumonitis or pneumonia.33 Place \nyour stethoscope on the child’s neck to distinguish \ncoarse lung crackles from conducted upper airway \nsounds due to upper airway secretions if they are heard \nin both lungs.\nPercussion, chest expansion and vocal fremitus\nPercussion can be very helpful in localised processes \nof the lung to describe the extent of dullness. Dullness \nto percussion can be the result of consolidation, collapse \n(atelectasis) or fluid in the pleural space. An increased \npercussion note (hyperresonance) suggests unilateral \nhyperinflation due to a unilateral pneumothorax; when \nassociated with wheeze it may be the result of a foreign \nbody in the main bronchus.\nChest expansion is not routinely measured but may \nbe assessed by percussion (p 95).\nVocal fremitus can be tested in older children.\nThe respiratory examination is completed with an \nassessment of the ear, nose and throat (see above).\nGastrointestinal system: abdomen\nExamination of the abdomen is central to assessment \nof the gastrointestinal system. Remember, however, \nthat examination of other systems can provide very \nimportant (and sometimes the only) clues to pathologies \nthat are primarily localised in the abdomen. Assessment \nof nutrition is part of the abdominal and gastrointestinal \nexamination. This includes a medical history (see \nTable 37.16) and a physical examination focused on \ndetecting significant loss of subcutaneous fat (face, arms, \nchest, buttocks), muscle wasting (temples, shoulders, \nthighs, knees, calves) and peripheral oedema (pretibial, \nsacral).\nDomain\nIndicators of potential impairment in \nnutritional status\nGrowth\nBelow third percentile\nCrossing percentiles downwards in \nserial measurements (may be normal \nin first 2 years of life and puberty if \nshifting towards fiftieth percentile)\nReduced weight-to-length percentile \nratio\nUnintentional weight loss (5–10% \nmoderate; >10% severe)\nRapid weight loss\nDietary \nintake\nAppetite (‘fussy’ eater)\nFrequency (decreases with age) and \namount (increases with age) of food\nFeeding problems (uncoordinated \nswallow)\nRestrictions (parent-perceived food \nintolerance versus specialist-diagnosed \nallergy)\nFunctional \nimpairment\nActivity\nPower / strength\nMetabolic \nstress\nInfection (gastroenteritis, sepsis, \npneumonia)\nInflammation (pancreatitis)\nEndocrine disorders (hyperthyroidism, \ndiabetes)\nTrauma\nSurgery (bowel resection)\nAbdominal \nsymptoms\nFrequent vomiting\nGastro-oesophageal reflux\nConstipation\nPain\nNausea\nDiarrhoea\nTABLE 37.16 \nNutrition-focused medical history\n",

If inguinal swelling \nis observed, it is commonly—but not always—caused \nby a hernia (see Ch 38). Carefully attempt to reduce \nthe hernia at the end of the examination. A hernia is \nan indication for prompt surgical review (and if not \nreducible this is urgent). Note any abdominal scars \nindicating past surgical operations that may be relevant \nto the current major problem. Carefully inspect the skin \nfor jaundice, discoloration, rashes, petechiae, bruising \nand spider naevi (see also Ch 38).\nAuscultation\nAuscultation of the abdomen is usually performed to \nassess bowel sounds and to listen for vascular bruits. It is \ngenerally felt that auscultation should take place before \npalpation, as this may alter bowel sounds. There is a \nlack of evidence that palpation alters bowel sounds but \nconventions in medicine are hard to alter. Auscultation \nrequires patience, cooperation from the child (and the \nparent) and, in the case of bruits, a quiet room.\nBegin by listening in the right upper quadrant over \nthe liver for bruits or rubs. Bruits can occasionally be \nheard in children with hepatic haemangiomas. Bowel \nsounds from the overlying segments of bowel will often \nbe heard in all quadrants. Next, move to the left upper \nquadrant to similarly listen over the spleen for bruits \nor rubs. Auscultate the left and right lower quadrants \nfor inguinal bruits, before moving to the periumbilical \nregion, where aortic and renal bruits are most commonly \nheard.7 If a renal bruit is suspected, listen within 2 \ncentimetres of the midline, halfway between the \numbilicus and the xiphoid process. Remember that a \nrenal bruit may be associated with hypertension as a \nresult of renal artery stenosis so measure the blood \npressure. Bruits are caused by turbulent flow through \nmajor blood vessels. Aortic bruits are usually heard \nonly in systole, whereas venous hums are continuous.\nTo conclude that no bowel sounds can be heard, \nyou need to have listened for several minutes and in \nseveral different areas of the abdomen. Bowel sounds \nthat can be heard without a stethoscope are referred \nto as borborygmi. The complete absence of bowel \nsounds in the setting of abdominal pathology is an \nominous sign that usually implies a paralytic ileus.34 \nIncreased or ‘active’ bowel sounds may be heard in \npatients with gastroenteritis, and when obstruction is \npresent they often have a high-pitched or ‘tinkling’ \nquality.\nquiet child with paucity of movements and suspected \nillness who is of greatest concern and who requires \nmost urgent assessment.\nInspection\nBegin with inspection. Imagine a vertical line and a \nperpendicular horizontal line running through the \numbilicus to ‘divide’ the abdomen into four quadrants \n(right upper, right lower, left upper, left lower) and \ndescribe the location of any abnormality. The abdomen \noften appears as if it is generally distended in toddlers \nowing to their physiological lumbar lordosis. Abdominal \ndistension may be observed with the following:\n•\t ascites (liver disease, cardiac failure, \nmalnutrition, protein-losing enteropathy)\n•\t malabsorption (coeliac disease, food allergy, \nlactase or sucrase–isomaltase deficiency and \nintolerance, glucose–galactose malabsorption)\n•\t maldigestion (pancreatic insufficiency in cystic \nfibrosis and Shwachman–Diamond syndrome, \nimpaired bile flow in chronic liver disease)\n•\t solid organomegaly (hepatic or haematological \nor infectious splenic disorders)\n•\t urogenital malformations (obstructive uropathy \ndue to urethral valves)\n•\t tumours (haemangioma, nephroblastoma, \nneuroblastoma)\n•\t cysts (polycystic kidney disease), abscess \n(paratyphoid in appendicitis)\n•\t mechanical (bowel obstruction due to impacted \nmeconium or stool, intussusception, malrotation \nwith volvulus, intestinal atresias, inflammatory or \npostsurgical adhesions) or paralytic ileus \n(infections [gastroenteritis, appendicitis], \npostsurgery, ischaemia, electrolyte imbalances \n[low potassium])\n•\t umbilical hernia and diastasis recti (separation of \nthe left and right rectus abdominis muscles).\nEpigastric peristalsis may be visible owing to hypertrophic \npyloric stenosis, which typically manifests after \nthe neonatal period with projectile vomiting and \nlife-threatening dehydration.

The \ntip of the spleen can often be felt in normal young \nchildren just below the left costal margin, particularly \nduring inspiration, and in the right lateral decubitus \nposition. If splenomegaly is suspected, it is important \nto ensure that you cannot palpate over the mass in \nthe cranial direction, that you can feel a notch along \nthe medial border and that the percussion note \nis dull.\nNext palpate for kidney enlargement or cysts. \nCauses include hydronephrosis due to obstructive \nuropathy, polycystic kidneys and tumours such as \nnephroblastoma and neuroblastoma. Palpation is \nperformed with two hands, one positioned beneath \nthe flank and the other anteriorly in line with the first \nhand. The kidney may be felt during inspiration and \ncan be trapped (ballotted) by pushing up with the hand \nunder the flank and catching the kidney as it rises with \nthe other hand.\nPercussion\nIn children, abdominal percussion is used mostly \nto assess organ size and to check for ascites, but it \nis also useful in detecting mass lesions and areas of \ntenderness. Generally, fluid such as ascites or urine \nin the bladder or mass lesions will elicit a dull sound, \nwhereas an air-filled structure like gas within the bowel \nwill elicit a resonant note on percussion. Techniques \nare not different from those used in adults (see Ch \n14), but be gentle, sensible and opportunistic in your \napproach.\nGenitourinary system and Tanner staging\nGenitourinary examination is not routinely performed \nin children, and in many instances, including suspected \nchild sexual abuse, should be carried out only by a \nclinician who is well trained in this area. For small \nchildren, the parent should always be present; if an \nolder child or adolescent is uncomfortable having \nthe parent act as a chaperone, another appropriate \nchaperone should be provided. The examination for \nambiguous genitalia is covered briefly in Chapter 38.\nGenital examination in males\nCheck that the scrotum contains both testes, which \nshould also be of similar size. Orchidometer beads \ncan be used to estimate testicular size. Examine \nthe skin for any unusual lesions and visualise the \nurethral meatus. Examine the glans for hypospadias \nAlthough auscultation is a commonly practised part \nof the paediatric abdominal examination, there is very \nlittle evidence of its value in the literature. Thankfully, \nwhat evidence can be found shows that bowel sounds \nhave high specificity but low sensitivity in diagnosing \nabdominal obstruction.35 This means that if abnormal \nsounds are heard, obstruction is likely, but the presence \nof normal bowel sounds will not accurately exclude \nbowel obstruction.\nPalpation\nOccasionally it is helpful to flex the knees or put a \ncushion under the neck in older children. This may \nhelp relax the abdominal muscles. First palpate all \nabdominal quadrants superficially and away from any \ntenderness. Remember to look at the child’s face—not \nyour hands—for any sign that the examination is \npainful. There is little you can do about a child’s giggling \nduring palpation except to try to divert his or her \nattention to something else. Giggling at least suggests \nthat the examination is not painful. Next palpate more \ndeeply with slow rather than poking movements. If \nyou can feel a mass, assess it for tenderness and size \nand try to define its borders. This can also be done by \npercussion. Feel the surface and decide whether it is \nflat or nodular and whether the texture is soft or firm. \nIf not completed previously, listen for bruits. A firm \nmass deep in the right lower abdominal quadrant (iliac \nfossa) is often due to faecal loading. This will disappear \nafter bowel movements.\nTo palpate the liver, begin in the right iliac fossa \nusing one hand in toddlers and infants and, if preferred, \nboth hands in older children. Advance towards the \nright hypochondrium, which is the area below the right \ncostal margin, and then across to the epigastrium to feel \nthe liver edge, which is usually palpable just below the \ncostal margin in older children or 1–2 centimetres below \nin younger children. The liver edge can be confirmed \nand the liver span can be determined with percussion \nusing a tape measure. This may help you to decide \nwhether the liver is enlarged (hepatomegaly) or pushed \ndownwards (liver ptosis) by lung hyperinflation or a \npleural effusion.\nTo palpate the spleen, begin in the left iliac fossa \nand advance towards the left costal margin. This is \ndifferent from the adult examination. Remember that \nan enlarged spleen in older children (as in adults) can \nextend into the right iliac fossa. An enlarged spleen \n",

Generally, enlargement of the \ntestes is the first physical evidence of puberty in males \n(~98%) and the appearance of palpable breast tissue \nunder the areola is the first physical evidence of puberty \nin females (~80%; see Fig. 37.33). In the remainder of \nadolescents, pubic hair is the first physical evidence (see \nFig. 37.34).7 For a quick screening it is often sufficient \nto show the child Tanner staging illustrations and ask \nwhere they see their current stage best represented.\nPhysical examination for suspected child \nabuse (see Text box 37.3)\nUnfortunately, child abuse is one of the leading causes \nof injury-related mortality in infants and children,36 \n(Republished with permission of John Wiley & Sons Inc, from Tanner \nJM.

The value of experience \nis not in seeing much, but in seeing wisely.  SIR WILLIAM OSLER (1849–1919)\nNeonates are very different from adult and even \npaediatric patients. They are very fragile, cannot \ncooperate in their examination and cannot give you a \nhistory.a The usual systematic approach to the history \ntaking and examination is often not possible and an \nopportunistic method must be adopted. This means \nthat history taking may have to wait until the parents, \nhospital staff or relatives are available and the \nexamination must be fitted around the infant’s feeding \nschedule, need for sleep and mood.\nTHE HISTORY\nIn many cases, history taking begins with a review of \nthe maternal and infant medical records (if available) \nand the gathering of information from clinical staff, \nand then progresses to an interview with the parents. \nAs with history taking for the adult, your approach \nneeds to be methodical. There may not be a presenting \ncomplaint, but asking about problems that may have \noccurred during the pregnancy or delivery is an \nimportant aspect of the history taking.\nRemember that this is usually a happy but anxious \ntime for new parents. They must be approached with \nunderstanding and patience. Allow enough time for \nthe interview and respect their privacy and sensitivities \nof various sorts. Parents’ worries must always be taken \nseriously and dealt with respectfully, even when they \nseem insignificant from a medical point of view.b\nFirst, introduce yourself to the parents and \ncongratulate them on the birth of their child. Explain \nthe reasons for the neonatal assessment and tell them \nhow it will be carried out. Ask for their consent \nwherever possible.\nMaternal health\nAssemble a comprehensive history by asking about the \nmother’s current and past medical and surgical history. \nThis should identify any chronic illnesses that could \naffect the baby’s health (see Table 38.1). If the mother \nhas an acute or a chronic illness, ask questions around \nthe mnemonic SIC:\nS ymptoms (severity, frequency, triggers, \ntreatments)\nI nvestigations\nC omplications.\nA maternal illness may affect the mother’s ability to \nlook after her baby and directly affect the baby’s health.\nNext, ascertain the mother’s health, lifestyle and \npsychosocial background using the mnemonic HeLP:\nHe alth status\nL ifestyle\nP sychosocial background.\nOf particular relevance is substance use (see Table 38.2). \nAlso assess nutrition and immunisation status and \npossible mental health problems. Ask tactfully what \nthe parents know about neonatal health and safety by \nkeeping in mind the mnemonic CARE:\nC oping with parenthood (e.g. understanding the \nbaby’s nutritional needs and sudden infant \ndeath syndrome [SIDS] risk factors)\na\t Paediatrics has been compared, rather unkindly, to veterinary medicine \nby adult physicians.\nb\t Experienced parents’ opinions should always be taken seriously.\n",

Clean your examination tools \n(e.g. stethoscope) thoroughly with the appropriate \nantimicrobial agents before and after use.\nUsually, newborns cannot turn but they may be \nable to move rather dangerously sidewards on the \nexamination table. This should be explained to the \nparents. It is imperative to create barriers on both sides \nof the baby (e.g. the wall and yourself) or to secure \nthe baby gently with your hand during the examination. \nNever step away without asking someone else to watch \nthe infant. Alternatively, carry the baby with you.\nMeasurements\nMeasurements of weight, length and occipitofrontal \nhead circumference are important for the detection of \nserious pathologies and for monitoring growth and \ndevelopment. To obtain the bare weight, fully undress \nthe neonate (including the nappy) and use an electronic \nbaby scale. Never leave the baby unattended on the \nscales as they may fall off and injure themselves. If the \nroom is too cold, use a heating lamp. Alternatively, \nyou can measure the baby covered with a preweighed \ntowel.\nUse a newborn stadiometer (also called a \nhead-board) to measure length. To obtain exact \nmeasurements a helper is required. Hold both the \nneonate’s feet on the footpiece with one hand, fully \nextend the neonate’s legs gently and slide the headpiece \nhorizontally to rest (gently) on top of the neonate’s \nhead.\nTo measure head circumference use a non-stretching \ntape measure around the neonate’s head at the widest \npoint. This is usually achieved by placing the end of \nthe tape measure on the middle of the forehead just \nabove the palpebral fissures, then wrapping it around \nthe tem­poral bones beneath the auricular helices and \nthe most posterior portion of the occipital bone. \nOccipitofrontal circumference measurements should \nbe taken until there is a variation of less than 0.5 \ncentimetres between two repeated measurements.\nPlot the results on growth charts that are most \nsuitable for your location. The WHO Child growth \nstandards (2006) charts (see Fig. 38.3) are based on \ndata from term, breastfed and healthy infants born to \nnon-smoking mothers in six countries (United States, \nNorway, India, Ghana, Brazil and Oman) and may \nbe appropriate for term babies (see www.who.int/\nchildgrowth/en/). The Fenton growth charts may be \nsuitable for premature neonates (see www.biomedcentral\n.com/1471-2431/3/13/figure/F2). Note that other growth \ncharts are available for premature babies (e.g. Babson \nand Benda,22 Lubchenco et al23 and Dancis et al24) and \nfor infants with specific genetic conditions (e.g. for \ntrisomy 2125).\n",

A baby can be constitutionally \nsmall (e.g. small parents) or pathologically small (fetal, \nmaternal, placental factors). If pathological SGA is \npotentially present, determine whether the newborn \nhas symmetrical intrauterine growth restriction (weight, \nlength and head circumference <tenth percentile). \nThis indicates slow growth development throughout \npregnancy present from a very early stage. Common \ncauses are:\n•\t intrauterine infections\n•\t maternal drug abuse\n•\t anaemia\n•\t chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus.\nThus, symmetrical SGA is often associated with other \nclinical signs and serious long-term sequelae (see Tables \n38.1 and 38.2). In contrast, asymmetrical intrauterine \ngrowth restriction leads to a disproportionate reduction \nin weight only (<tenth percentile) and indicates \nimpaired growth development in the third trimester. \nCommon causes are:\n•\t pre-eclampsia\n•\t placental insufficiency\n•\t multiple gestation\n•\t maternal age >35 years.\nAs the subcutaneous fat layer is underdeveloped, \nthese neonates are at increased risk of hypoglycaemia, \nhypocalcaemia, polycythaemia, fetal distress and \nhypoxia.\nA common cause of LGA is gestational diabetes, \nwhich has the potential to lead to serious complications \nif not recognised and managed appropriately (see \nTable 38.1).\nHead-to-toe assessment\nPosture and spontaneous movements\nObserve the baby’s posture and any spontaneous \nmovements. Newborns perform flexion in the upper \nand lower limbs and symmetrical alternating movements \ninvolving all extremities. Deviation from this pattern \nmay indicate birth injuries, deformities, or neurological \nor genetic abnormalities. A lack of spontaneous \nmovements, which occur only on stimulation, is \nassociated with a marked risk of severe illness.18\nGeneralised paucity of movements\nIf the baby is in a frog-leg position and there is a paucity \nof limb movements, this suggests reduced muscle tone \nand power (floppy infant). A history of polyhydramniosc \nand poor fetal movements may indicate congenital \nhypotonia and a problem with motor neurones that \ntravel from the anterior horn of the spinal cord to the \nmuscles (lower motor neurone lesions such as spinal \nmuscular atrophy), motor end plate (e.g. congenital \nmyasthenia gravis, botulism), or muscles (congenital \nmyopathy, muscular dystrophy, infections).\nLook for muscle fasciculations, especially of the \ntongue, and remember to test for a lack of tendon \nreflexes (biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, knee and ankle) \nthat is suspicious for a lower motor neurone lesion. In \nthe first 6 months of life upper motor neurone \nabnormalities are often associated with reduced muscle \ntone rather than spasticity (see List 38.1). The presence \nof increased muscle tone (‘stiff limbs’) indicates the \npossibility of severe illness in the newborn.18 In older \nbabies, an upper motor neurone lesion should be \nsuspected if there is scissoring of the lower limbs and \nflexion of the thumbs.\nLocalised paucity of movements\nAsymmetry in power and tone may indicate a focal \nupper or lower (e.g. brachial plexus palsies) motor \nc\t Increased amniotic fluid volume.\nCAUSES OF UPPER MOTOR NEURONE \nWEAKNESS IN INFANTS\nGeneralised\n• \nHypoxic encephalopathy due to birth \nasphyxia\n• \nMetabolic disturbances, infections\n• \nChromosomal abnormalities\nAsymmetrical\n• \nCerebrovascular accident or haemorrhage\n• \nIntracranial\n• \nSpinal malformation\nLIST 38.1 \n",

Dysregulation of the autonomic nervous \nsystem with apnoeic spells and increased heart rate \nin isolation or combination with loss of muscle tone \n(limbs becoming limp) may be the only sign of neonatal \nseizures.16\nJittery limb movements\nJitters are common in the first days of life and refer to \nrhythmic tremors of equal amplitude as a presentation \nof excited neuromuscular activity (jitteriness / \ntremulousness). They are sensitive to stimulation and \ncan easily be interrupted by gentle flexion or holding \nof the involved extremities.

The normal colour \nof fair-skinned newborns is pink. A bluish appearance \nof the hands and feet (acrocyanosis) is common in the \nfirst days of life. A number of skin changes without \npathological relevance are often present. These include:\n•\t erythema toxicum (see Fig. 38.9(a))\n•\t sebaceous hyperplasia (see Fig. 38.9(b))\n•\t miliae—tiny epidermal cysts, probably the result \nof blocked pilosebaceous opening (see Fig. 38.9(c \nand d))\n•\t salmon patches / angel’s kiss (naevus simplex; see \nFig. 38.9(e))\n•\t hyperpigmentations (‘Mongolian spots’; see \nFig. 38.9(f)).\nHowever, generalised rashes and blister can be caused \nby life-threatening disease in neonates.\nHowever, a generalised erythematous rash and \nfluid-filled small blisters (vesicles) or large blisters (bullae) \nwith exfoliation of the skin on gentle rubbing (Nikolskys \nsign—due to toxic epidermal necrolysis) is suggestive \nof ’Staphylococcus aureus’ infection (called Ritters disease \nof the newborn or Staphylococcus scalded skin syndrome). \nLess generalised blisters (bullous impetigo) or \nerythematous papules (non-bullous impetigo) are more \ncommonly seen and caused by Staphylococcus and \nStreptococcus spp. The occurrence of vesicles with \nsurrounding erythema in the face or scalp that develop \ninto pustules filled with purulent or cloudy material in \na baby who had a vaginal delivery is indicative of neonatal \nherpes.\nLarge pigmented naevi are caused by a benign \nproliferation of melanocytes but they need to be \nmonitored for changes in size and shape that might \nindicate the development of malignancy.28 Port-wine \nstains (naevus flammeus) are dark-red or purple skin \npatches with well-defined borders and can be associated \nwith other abnormalities (e.g. Sturge–Weber syndrome).\nHaemangiomas of infancy are benign and present \nas a superficial nascent (new) lesion consisting of \nsmall dilated blood vessels (capillary telangiectasias) \nsurrounded by a pale halo (see Fig. 38.10(a)), a pale \nor erythematous macule or a bruise or scratch.29 \nSuperficial haemangiomas that have progressed from \na nascent into a proliferative stage show a strawberry-like \nappearance with a raised, bright-red and lobulated \ndermis and may feel warm. A colour change from bright \nred to grey may indicate shrinkage (involution), \nwhich usually starts centrally.29 A deep haemangioma \noriginating from the subcutis appears as a soft mass \nwith a dusky or bluish colour (see Fig. 38.10(b)) but \nit can be difficult to distinguish clinically from other \nvascular malformations. Be aware that the presence of \nhaemangiomas on the face or neck is associated with \nhaemangiomas of the airway and that more than five \ncutaneous haemangiomas anywhere else is associated \nwith visceral haemangiomas.\nVisible jaundice develops with a total serum \nbilirubin of greater than 6 mg / dL or 102.6 mmol / L \n(1 mg / dL = 17.1 mmol / L). However, it is difficult to \nestimate the severity of hyperbilirubinaemia by the \nvisual assessment of jaundice.30 Physiological jaundice \nis not usually evident in the first 24 hours of life (e.g. \nless than 6 mg / dL) but peaks at day 3 to day 5 after \nbirth, does not exceed 15 mg / dL and resolves within \na week’s time in term newborns and within 2 weeks \nin premature babies. However, some neonates develop \nexcessive hyperbilirubinaemia, which requires careful \nmonitoring and potentially treatment (see List 38.3).\nIf significant jaundice is present, look for signs of \nor associated factors that can lead to excessive red blood \ncell breakdown (haemolysis) such as:\n•\t excessive bruising and cephalohaematoma (e.g. \nbirth trauma)\n•\t splenomegaly (e.g. associated with spherocytosis)\n•\t pallor\n",

The metopic suture is the \nline where the frontal skull bones meet; it extends \nfrom the anterior fontanel down the middle of the \nforehead towards the nose. Metopic synostosis results in \nthe development of a triangular-shaped forehead when \nviewed from above (trigonocephaly). The coronal suture \nmarks the point where the frontal and parietal skull \nbones on each side meet; it extends from ear to ear. \nBilateral synostosis leads to a short anterior–posterior \nand increased transverse head diameter (brachycephaly), \nwhereas unilateral synostosis will result in anterior \nplagiocephaly. The sagittal suture line is formed by \nthe two parietal bones; it extends from the anterior \nto the posterior fontanel. Premature fusion results in \na long, narrow head shape and is the most common \nsynostosis (scaphocephaly). The lambdoidal suture is \nthe space between the two parietal bones and the single \noccipital bone and if fused it leads to a trapezoid-shaped \nhead with flattening of the occipital region on one \nside (posterior plagiocephaly). Note, however, that \nthe most common—and self-resolving—presentation, \nthat of posterior plagiocephaly, is caused by positional \nmoulding due to the fetus’ position in utero, which may \nbe exacerbated by the infant’s preference for placing \nthe head on the same side during sleep. Oxycephaly \n(turricephaly) is the premature fusion of all cranial \nsutures. Craniosynostoses may be seen in association \nwith Apert’s, Crouzon’s, Saethre–Chotzen, Pfeiffer’s or \nCarpenter’s syndrome.\nFontanels\nNext, palpate the anterior and posterior fontanels \nfor fullness and size. The anterior fontanel is a \ndiamond-shaped opening of the skull at the point where \nthe frontal and parietal skull bones meet at the junction \nbetween the metopic, sagittal and coronal suture lines. \nThe mean area of the anterior fontanel is 220 mm2 \n(2.5th to 97.5th centile: 164 to 276 mm2) in term \nnewborns32 and is expected to be closed at 18 months \nof age. The size can be determined by introducing the \nindex finger into each of the four bony corners of the \nfontanel, marking them with a small circular ink dot \nimmediately distal to the finger, transferring the four \ndots onto paper by firmly pressing it onto the skin and \ncalculating the area (see Fig. 38.12). The posterior \nfontanel is triangle shaped, situated at the junction of \nthe sagittal and lambdoidal suture lines and is closed \nby 3 months of age. Large or bulging fontanels may \nindicate raised intracranial pressure (see List 38.4) \nwhereas an increase in size without fullness is observed \nin neonates with bony and endocrine abnormalities \n(see List 38.5).33 Premature closure of the fontanels \nmay be associated with craniosynostoses (see above). \nAuscultate for bruits, which can be heard with \nintracranial aneurysmal malformations (e.g. of the vein \nof Galen, the great cerebral vein).34\nFace\nEyes (see Text box 38.2)\nExamination of the eyes has the potential to disturb \nthe infant and may best be done last.

Applying \na positive pressure using a pneumatic otoscope prevents \nthe collapse of the cartilaginous auricular meatus for \nbetter visualisation of the tympanic membrane, which \nis greyer, thicker and more vascular in newborns than \nin older children.37 Middle ear effusions are commonly \nseen but resolve in the first 3 days of life in most \nneonates.38\nNose\nInspect the external nose for any deformity and \nasymmetry of the nasal bridge and nares, which can \naffect nasal airway patency. Nasal flaring may indicate \nrespiratory distress. Infants are preferential nose \nbreathers and bilateral nasal airway patency should \ntherefore be verified, particularly in those babies with \nsigns of respiratory distress or apnoeic spells.

Non-structural abnormalities such \nas mucosal oedema may also cause nasal obstruction. \nClear nasal discharge is commonly caused by a \nvirus-induced upper respiratory tract infection (and \nvery rarely by a cranial cerebrospinal fluid leak), whereas \npurulent discharge may indicate a bacterial aetiology.\nMouth\nInspect the mandibles from the front and sides to \nidentify lower facial asymmetry and abnormal jaw \nsize. A Pierre Robinp sequence is suggested by a \nproportionally small mandible (micrognathia), which \nincludes posterior displacement of the tongue into the \npharynx (glossoptosis) and airway obstruction. It may \nbe associated with a cleft palate.40\nIf you have made the baby cry, look for the \nsymmetrical opening of the mouth and for apparently \nunrestricted side and forward mobility. This excludes \ntemporomandibular joint fixation (ankylosis).41\nNote the presence of lip cyanosis and a cleft lip or \nany other dysmorphic features (e.g. small upper lip \nand smooth philtrum in fetal alcohol spectrum \ndisorder).\nInspect the oral cavity for cleft palate and a bifid \nuvula, which may occasionally indicate a submucous \ncleft. Cleft lip and palate interfere with swallowing and \nfeeding, whereas the clinical relevance of a submucous \ncleft may surface only later in life with symptoms of \nvelopharyngealq insufficiency (nasal regurgitation, \nrecurrent ear infections, hypernasality of speech). \nExclusion of a cleft palate requires palpation of the \nhard and soft palate with the index finger and while \nwearing an examination glove. Prevent full closure of \nthe mouth during the examination of the palate as \nstrong sucking by the neonate otherwise precludes \nassessment of the soft palate.\nSmall white cysts at the junction between the soft \nand hard palates or the gum (Epstein’s pearls; see Fig. \n38.17(a)) are common and harmless if they do not \ninterfere with function (e.g. feeding). Natal (present \nat birth) or neonatal (erupting in the first month of \nlife) teeth, mostly lower central incisors, are often loose \nand show enamel hypoplasia, making extraction the \ntreatment of choice.42 Assess the size of the tongue \n(e.g. aglossia or microglossia, which is associated with \nmicrognathia; and macroglossia, which is associated \nwith Beckwith–Wiedemann, Down’s syndrome or \nhypothyroidism). Look at its position (e.g. for \nglossoptosis) and mobility (e.g. tongue tie [lingual \nfrenulumr]; see Fig. 38.17(b)).43 The need for treatment \nof ankyloglossia can be assessed using standardised \nscore sheets. Look beneath the tongue for sublingual \n(central) cyanosis.\nNeck\nExamine the neck for symmetry and abnormal skinfolds. \nLoose nuchals skin can be seen in several conditions \n(e.g. intrauterine lymphoedema, Down’s syndrome, \nNoonan’s syndrome and Turner’s syndrome; see \nFig. 38.18).\nLook at the sternocleidomastoid muscles for \nunilateral shortening or swelling to rule out congenital \ntorticollis. In this condition the head tilts towards the \naffected side while the chin points to the opposite side. \nTurn the baby’s head gently from side to side as far as \nthe neck will allow. The full range of movement is \nrestricted when torticollis is present.\nLook for cervical masses (e.g. cystic hygromas,t \nthyroglossal cysts, epidermoid cysts), which present \nwith painless, soft or semifirm swellings. In newborn \ninfants, cystic hygromas are most commonly found \nin the posterior cervical space on one side and vary \nin size. Large ones may cause compromise to the \nairway and extend into the mediastinum or face.44 \nThyroglossal cysts are most commonly localised in the \nmidline at or below the level of the hyoid bone and \nmove upwards with tongue protrusion.45 Epidermoid \ncysts are found at the floor of the mouth and superior \nto the hyoid bone.

If \nyou have made the baby cry, auscultation may be \nimpossible.\nInspect the chest for symmetrical expansion and \nany deformities. These may be acquired (fracture or \npneumothorax) or congenital (pectus or dystrophy). \nA depressed sternum (pectus excavatum—funnel \nchest; see Fig. 38.19) is the most commonly observed \ncongenital deformity.47 A protuberance of the sternum \n(pectus carinatum—pigeon chest) may be symmetrical \nor affect only one side of the chest wall, which results \nin asymmetry with sternal rotation and depression of \nthe contralateral site of the chest wall. A narrow chest \ndue to the intrauterine failure of chest wall growth (e.g. \nJeune’s syndrome [asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy], \nPoland’s syndrome [hypoplasia of the chest wall variably \ninvolving soft tissues, muscles and ribs], Ellis–van \nCreveld syndrome [chondroectodermal dysplasia]) may \nbe associated with bilateral lung hypoplasia. Unilateral \nlung hypoplasia is commonly observed with a left-sided \ndiaphragmatic hernia.\nCount the respiratory rate over one full minute \n(normal is 40–60 breaths per minute) by assessing both \nchest movements and breath sounds. Fast breathing \n(tachypnoea) predicts severe illness moderately well.16\nAssess for intermittent upper airway obstruction \n(e.g. Pierre Robin sequence, choanal atresia, tracheo- or \nlaryngomalacia). These babies cannot move air \nsufficiently despite normal or increased respiratory \nefforts. Asymmetry in chest movements suggests that \nphrenic nerve palsy has caused unilateral paralysis of \nthe diaphragm. If you have made the baby cry, use the \nopportunity to note the presence of abnormal crying \n(e.g. weak or hoarse). Paradoxical inward movements \nof the chest and outward movements of the abdomen \nduring inspiration are normal in newborns, particularly \nin sleep when chest compliance increases.\nEpisodes of periodic breathing (normal breathing \nfor as long as 20 seconds followed by an apnoeic \nperiod of less than 10 seconds) that occur at least \nthree times in succession48 are normal in newborn \ninfants. However, apnoeas defined as cessations of \nairflow for longer than 20 seconds (or associated with \noxygen desaturation or bradycardia)49 in a term neonate \nare commonly a manifestation of serious potentially \nlife-threatening illnesses requiring urgent evaluation \nand intervention.50\nLook carefully for other signs of respiratory distress \nsuch as nasal flaring, intercostal and subcostal chest \nrecessions, tracheal tug and grunting. Central cyanosis \noccurs when the amount of deoxygenated haemoglobin \nis greater than 3 g / dL or so.51 The aetiology may be a \nright-to-left shunt due to pulmonary or intracardiac \nconditions.\nCentral cyanosis is associated with low partial \narterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) and a variable degree \nof reduction in the percentage of haemoglobin saturated \nwith oxygen (SaO2), which depends on the total \nhaemoglobin concentration.51 For example, a severely \nanaemic neonate with a total haemoglobin of 8 g / dL \nwill appear cyanosed only if the SaO2 is less than 63%, \nwhereas a polycythaemic infant with a total haemoglobin \nof 25 g / dL will appear cyanosed with a SaO2 of 88%.51 \nIt is important to remember that peripheral cyanosis \n(acrocyanosis) in the first days of life is common and \nusually without any pathological relevance.\nChest\nTest the capillary refill time by pressing your index \nfinger onto the neonate’s chest for 2 seconds.

Feel for \nabdominal masses and the bladder. The upper edge \nof a full bladder can be verified with percussion and \nshould be below the umbilicus; otherwise, further \ninvestigations for causes leading to urinary retention \n(e.g. urethral valves, drugs, dysraphic spinal lesion) \nand appropriate intervention are urgently warranted. \nInspect the back for spinal dysraphism (spina \nbifida).\nPercuss the abdomen. Masses and fluid have a dull \npercussion note, whereas an obstructed abdomen will \ngenerally be resonant.\nNext listen for bowel sounds. They should be easily \nheard. They may be increased if there is mechanical \nbowel obstruction or heard clearly in the chest if the \nbaby has a diaphragmatic hernia. Auscultate for renal \nbruits.\nInguinal region and genitals\nIf an inguinal hernia has been seen on inspection an \nattempt should be made to see whether it is reducible, \nusing gentle pressure in the direction of the inguinal \ncanal. However, if the hernia is non-reducible or appears \nto be painful, incarceration of herniated bowel, ovary \nor testis should be considered (a surgical emergency). \nAdvise parents to be very vigilant for reducibility and \npain if a hernia is detected.\nIf the scrotum is empty and an inguinal or \nsuprascrotal testis (size 1.0–1.5 centimetres) can be \npalpated, try carefully to manipulate the testis into the \nscrotum. A retractable testis that remains in the scrotum \nfor some time is a normal finding. A testis that \nimmediately returns into the original position is an \nundescended testis, which requires further management \nto prevent infertility and increased risk for malignancy. \nIf a testis is impalpable that may be because it is located \nin the abdomen (undescended), too small to be found \nby you (atrophic) or absent (e.g. in combination with \nambiguous genitalia, see below).\nScrotum and penis\nExamine the scrotum. Discoloration of the scrotum may \noccur as a result of ischaemia due to testicular torsion, \nwhich is another surgical emergency. A large painless \nfluctuant scrotum can be assessed with a torch (see Fig. \n18.11 on p 315) to demonstrate translucency of light \ndue to fluid accumulation (hydrocele). This occurs in \n2%–5% of baby boys. It often resolves spontaneously \nin the first year of life but may require correction if \npersistent.\nExamine the penis. A length of less than 2.5 \ncentimetres is abnormal. Do not withdraw the foreskin \n(prepuce) for routine inspection of the urethral meatus \nbecause adherence to the glans penis is normal in \ninfants. However, an abnormal opening of the prepuce \non the ventral side of the penis is often associated with \nmalposition of the urethral meatus (hypospadias). The \nurethral meatus should also be inspected if there is \nbending of the penis (chordee) or the neonate does \nnot pass urine. A urethral meatus that opens at the \ndorsum of the penis in association with a marked \nchordee is a severe but rare penile abnormality that \nrequires urgent assessment of associated renal tract \nabnormalities (by ultrasound).\nFemale genitalia\nInspect the female genitalia for the presence of normal \nlabia majora, which should not be fused but cover the \nlabia minora in term newborns. The clitoris is found \nat the upper border of the labia minora and the urethra \nis visible below, with the hymen below that. Inspect \nfor any skin tags or mucoid cysts. Effects of maternal \nhormones regularly cause mucoid vaginal discharge, \noccasionally mixed with blood, which is normal in the \nfirst days of life.\nAmbiguous genitalia\nAmbiguous genitalia are a medical emergency and \ncan be a cause of great psychosocial distress to \nthe family. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) \nsecondary to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (less commonly \n11-hydroxylase, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) \ncauses \novervirilisation \n(labial \nfusion, \nclitoral \nenlargement, joint vagina and urethra [urogenital \nsinus]) leading to masculinised external genitalia \nin female (karyotype 46, XX) neonates. Babies with \n21-hydroxylase deficiency are at risk of life-threatening \nsalt wasting.\nNeonates with syndromes such as Smith–Lemli–Opitz \n(microcephaly, syndactyly, cleft palate, hypospadias, \ngrowth retardation) and VACTERL (vertebral \nabnormalities, anal atresia, cardiac abnormalities, TOF, \noesophageal atresia, renal abnormalities, limb defects) \nmay show variable degrees of genital ambiguity.\n",

If there \nis a full passive range of motion present at birth, then \nno active treatment is required, but gentle stretching \nmay be required if there is restriction of movement. \nIn severe cases, casting may be considered.\nRocker-bottom foot (congenital vertical talus) is a \nrare foot deformity where the midfoot is dorsally \ndislocated on the hindfoot (see Fig. 38.24(d)). Although \napproximately 60% of cases are idiopathic, up to 40% \nare associated with an underlying neuromuscular \ncondition or syndrome.69 On examination, it is noted \nthat the plantar surface of the foot is convex, with a \nprominent talar head along the medial border of the \nmidfoot. The fore part of the foot is dorsiflexed and \nabducted relative to the hindfoot, and the hindfoot is \nin equinus and valgus. Examine closely for any \ncoexisting neurological or musculoskeletal abnormalities \n(e.g. arthrogryposis and meningomyelocele). This does \nnot respond to stretching, and usually requires surgery.\nHips\nThe hip examination is of critical importance to check \nfor developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). It has \nbeen estimated that approximately 15% of DDH is not \ndetectable at birth, even by experienced examiners or \nultrasonographers.70 Careful repeated examination of \nthe infant in the first year of life by a skilled practitioner \nis crucial. Be aware of the increased risk of DDH seen \nin breech deliveries, girls and babies who have a positive \nfamily history of this condition. The rationale and \nimportance of repeated examination needs to be \nexplained to parents prior to the examination. \nExamination of the hips is often best left until the end \nof the neonatal examination, as it can be distressing \nto the child (and parents!).aa\nAfter inspecting the lower limbs, perform the \nOrtolani and Barlow tests (see below). Ensure that the \nbaby is relaxed and undressed and lying supine. Examine \neach hip individually, with your free hand stabilising \nthe contralateral side of the pelvis. Very little force is \nrequired for each of these manoeuvres. Forceful and \nrepeated examinations can damage the femoral head. \nA high-pitched ‘click’ may be heard during these \nmanoeuvres. This is often musculoskeletal or \nligamentous in origin and is usually of no clinical \nsignificance. If the examination is equivocal, or the \nbaby is at increased risk of DDH, then sonography at \n6 weeks is recommended.\nOrtolani test: this is performed to elicit the sensation \nof the dislocated hip being reduced. The hip is flexed \nto 90° with the knee resting in the palm of your hand. \nPlace your index and middle fingers along the greater \ntrochanter and your thumb on the inner thigh. Hold \nthe leg in a neutral position. Gently abduct the hip \nwhile lifting the leg anteriorly. A positive Ortolani sign \nis when a ‘clunk’ is felt as the dislocated femoral head \nreduces into the acetabulum.\nBarlow provocation test: this is performed to detect \nthe unstable hip dislocating from the acetabulum. It \nis performed with your hands in the same positions \nas for the Ortolani test, with the hips flexed to 90°. \nThe leg is adducted while posteriorly directed pressure \nis placed on the knee. A positive Barlow’s sign occurs \nwhen a palpable ‘clunk’ or sensation of movement is \nfelt as the femoral head exits the acetabulum posteriorly.\nCentral and peripheral nervous systems\nExamine for tone and positioning taking into account \nthe gestational age of the neonate. The normal term \ninfant will usually position him- or herself with the \nhips abducted and slightly flexed, knees flexed, upper \nlimbs adducted with flexion at the elbows and hands \nsoftly clenched (the well-known ‘fetal position’). The \nhypotonic infant (and the preterm infant) often adopts \na ‘frog-like’ position with abducted hips and extended \nelbows (see Fig. 38.25). Very premature infants (less \nthan 30 weeks) will have very minimal flexor tone, and \nthis will develop first in the lower limbs and then in \nthe upper limbs (between 34 and 36 weeks’ corrected \nage).bb\nAnother quick check for tone is to suspend the \nbaby in a ventral position, lying supported over your \nhand and forearm (see Fig. 38.26). There should be \nsome resistance to gravity in the normal baby, whereas \nthe hypotonic baby will flop like a rag-doll. Bear in \nmind that following a feed even a normal term infant \nmay appear slightly hypotonic, and repeat examination \nis suggested.\naa\t In fact, most parts of the neonatal examination seem best left to the end.\nbb\t For babies up to at least 2 years of age, subtract the number of weeks \nthe baby was premature from its age (and for longer in the extremely \npremature infant).\n",

This is usually present \nby 34 weeks’ gestation and disappears by around \n3–4 months of age.\n•\t The grasp reflex / palmar grasp: this is elicited by \nplacing your index finger into the infant’s palm. \nWhen you attempt to withdraw your finger, the \ninfant should tighten his or her grasp—so much \nso that the term infant can be lifted off the bed \nfor a few seconds. This reflex is usually present \nby 26 weeks’ gestation, although fetal palmar \nreflex grasping of the umbilical cord is often seen \non routine ultrasound examination from around \n16 weeks’ gestation.74 The reflex usually \ndisappears by around 3 months of age. The \nabsence of this reflex usually reflects peripheral \nor spinal cord involvement, particularly if it is \nasymmetrical.74\n•\t The plantar grasp: this is elicited by pressing your \nthumb against the sole of the infant’s foot, just \nbehind the toes. The infant should flex and \nadduct the toes. Alternatively, the infant can be \nheld vertically and the feet stimulated by floor \ncontact. Again, the toes should flex and adduct. \nThis reflex is usually present by 30 weeks’ \ngestation and disappears between 10 and 15 \nmonths of age. A reduced or negative plantar \ngrasp reflex during early infancy can be a \nsensitive indicator of later development of \nspasticity.74\n•\t The asymmetric tonic neck reflex (ATNR): this is \nelicited by turning the infant’s head to the side. \nThere should be extension of the upper extremity \non the side to which the head and neck are \nturned and flexion of the contralateral upper \nextremity (the fencing posture). The lower \nextremity responds similarly, but is much less \nstriking. This reflex is usually present by 35 \nweeks’ gestation and disappears by around 6 \nmonths of age.72 When this is seen as a resting \nposture, it is never normal.\nGestational age\nThe gestational age can be determined by fetal \nultrasound, maternal menstrual cycle and postnatal \nneuromuscular and physical maturation. Although not \nperformed routinely,75 if there are doubts about the \nexact gestational age (e.g. late recognition of pregnancy), \nuse the New Ballard Score (NBS)75 for postnatal \nestimation of gestational age in neonates up to 1 week \nold.76\nT&O’C ESSENTIALS\n1.\t Babies cannot cooperate with the examiner and \ntheir examination must be performed as the \nopportunity occurs.\n2.\t The parents must be involved at all stages and \nnothing should be done without their being \ninformed.\n3.\t Parts of the examination may be performed \nwhile the mother nurses the baby.\n4.\t Do not let the baby get cold or fall off the \nexamination table.\n5.\t Taking serial measurements and charting these \nresults are essential for monitoring a baby’s \nprogress.\nContinued\n",

It is derived from the Latin \nobstetrix, which literally means midwife: ‘mid’ meaning \n‘with’ (Old English, still seen in ‘mit’ in German) and \n‘wife’ meaning ‘the woman’. The obstetric system is \nmostly concerned with normal processes, rather than \na disease state. There are also two patients, and not \none. Both of these factors differentiate it from other \nbranches of medicine. It is important to understand \nthe symptoms and signs of a normal pregnancy so as \nto understand what is pathological.1–5\nEARLY PREGNANCY \nSYMPTOMS\n(See Questions box 39.1.)\nAmenorrhoea\nAmenorrhoea is the absence of a menstrual period in \na woman of reproductive age. In a woman presenting \nwith amenorrhoea, pregnancy must be assumed until \nproven otherwise. A urinary or serum hCG level will \nconfirm the presence of a pregnancy. The dating of \npregnancy is done using the last external physical sign \nprior to pregnancy, which is the first day of the last \nmenstrual period (LMP). This assumes that the patient’s \ncycle length is 28 days and that ovulation thus occurs \non day 14 (as ovulation occurs 14 days prior to the \nonset of menses). The estimated date of confinement \n(EDC), or due date, is calculated at 280 days, or 40 \nweeks from the LMP. When the cycle length varies \nQUESTIONS TO ASK A WOMAN WHO \nMAY BE PREGNANT\n1.\t When was the first day of your last \nmenstrual period?\n2.\t Was it normal in volume and length? (A \nlight bleed may occur at the time of \nimplantation and be confused with a \nperiod.)\n3.\t Are your periods usually regular? What is \nthe usual number of days from the first \nday of one period to the first day of the \nnext period?\n4.\t Are you currently sexually active?\n5.\t Have you had previous pregnancies?\n6.\t Have you had difficulty becoming \npregnant or have you been using fertility \ntreatment?\n7.\t Have you been using any form of \ncontraception?

When the cycle length is \nirregular, the woman does not remember her LMP, \nshe is breastfeeding or has ceased hormonal con­\ntraception immediately prior to the pregnancy, the date \nof the pregnancy should be confirmed with a pelvic \nultrasound examination.\nAnother method of calculation of EDC is Naegele’s \nrule. This is done by counting back 3 calendar months \nfrom the LMP and adding 7 days. For example, if the \nLMP is 15 May then the EDC will be 22 February. This \nrule also assumes a 28-day cycle.\nBreast changes\nAlthough not diagnostic of pregnancy, breast tenderness \nand paraesthesia are common symptoms in the first \nweeks of pregnancy. As the pregnancy progresses the \nbreasts enlarge and the subcutaneous veins become \nmore prominent. The nipple area enlarges and the \npigment darkens. Later in the pregnancy the nipple \nmay produce colostrum, a thick yellow fluid.\nNausea and vomiting\nThe majority of women experience nausea in pregnancy \nand approximately half will experience vomiting. It is \ncorrelated with the rise of hCG levels and is usually \npresent from 6–16 weeks’ gestation. When a woman \npresents with very early or intractable vomiting, it is \nimportant to investigate with an ultrasound to rule \nout multiple pregnancy or gestational trophoblastic \ndisease. In some cases it can lead to hyperemesis \ngravidaruma (see below).\nMINOR SYMPTOMS IN \nPREGNANCY\nPregnancy is traditionally divided into three trimesters. \nThe first trimester and its complications are considered \n‘gynaecological’ by convention and are covered in \nChapter 40, ‘The gynaecological history and examination \nand basic investigations’. The following symptoms \nmay occur at any stage of the pregnancy, but are \nmore common in the second and third trimesters. \n(See List 39.1.)\nHyperemesis gravidarum\nHyperemesis gravidarum is intractable vomiting \noccurring in pregnancy, associated with increased hCG \nlevels such as in multiple gestation and molar pregnancy. \nIt is transient and usually resolves by 16 weeks’ gestation. \nHyperthyroidism should be excluded on initial \ninvestigations and treatment is guided by symptoms. \nHyperemesis gravidarum can occur as early as 5 weeks’ \ngestation.\nHeartburn and acid \nregurgitation\nIncreased progesterone levels in pregnancy cause \ndecreased gastrointestinal motility and slower gastric \nemptying. Levels of gastric acid secretion reduce; \nhowever, the oesophageal pressure is also reduced, \nleading to acid regurgitation.\nConstipation\nConstipation is a very common symptom in pregnancy, \nwhich is likely also to be associated with the effect of \nthe progesterone. This is often worsened by iron \nsupplementation. Haemorrhoids are a common side \neffect of the constipation, which usually resolve \npostnatally.\nMINOR SYMPTOMS IN PREGNANCY\n• \nHyperemesis gravidarum\n• \nHeartburn and acid regurgitation\n• \nConstipation\n• \nBack pain\n• \nPubic symphysis pain\n• \nVaginal discharge\n• \nPruritus\n• \nNeuropathies\n• \nTiredness\n• \nBreathlessness\n• \nPalpitations\n• \nAnkle oedema\nLIST 39.1 \na\t ‘Gravidus’ means ‘burdened’ in Latin.\n",

Bell’s \npalsy (unilateral lower motor neurone lesion of the \nfacial nerve) has an increased incidence during \npregnancy and the puerperium.b Compression and \ndamage of the lumbar and sacral nerves are also \nassociated with pregnancy and delivery.\nTiredness\nThis is most common in the first and third trimesters, \naffecting almost all pregnant women at some stage \nduring their pregnancy. As the uterus enlarges, women \nfeel uncomfortable and have increasing urinary \nfrequency, causing sleep to become difficult.\nBreathlessness\nDyspnoea is reported in up to 70% of pregnant patients. \nMost of this is physiological. Asthma exacerbations \nmust be excluded in women in whom it is pre-existing.\nPalpitations\nHeart rate increases in pregnancy in response to \nthe increasing blood volume and cardiac output \nrequirements. There is poor correlation between \nsymptoms and pathological arrhythmias; however, if the \npalpitations are persistent, they should be investigated \nwith an ECG, Holter monitor and evaluation of \nelectrolytes and thyroid function.\nMAJOR SYMPTOMS IN \nPREGNANCY\nThe major symptoms in pregnancy are summarised in \nList 39.2.\nChange in fetal movements\nFetal movements are a good indication of fetal wellbeing. \nThey are usually first appreciated at 17–22 weeks’ \ngestation (the ‘quickening’) and continue until delivery. \nTowards the end of the third trimester the movements \nare often not as vigorous, but should be as frequent. \nBack pain\nAs the uterine size increases, there is increasing lordosis \nin the lumbar spine and a relaxation of the musculature, \ncontributing to back pain. As the fetal head descends \ninto the pelvis, the pain may also occur in the vagina \nand buttocks and radiate into the upper legs.\nPubic symphysis pain\nThis is point tenderness over the pubic symphysis, \nwhich is usually exacerbated with movement. This is \na result of ligament laxity as well as increasing uterine \npressure. The pain can be relieved by rest, and simple \nanalgesia may be useful.\nVaginal discharge\nIn the early stages of pregnancy the cervical mucus \nis thick, obstructs the cervical canal and creates a \nbarrier to protect the uterine contents. During the early \nstages of labour, this mucous plug is expelled and is \ncolloquially called ‘the show’. There is an increase in \nvaginal discharge throughout pregnancy. It is usually \nthick and white, resulting from the increased lactic acid \nproduction from the glycogen in the epithelium of the \nvagina. Candidal vaginal infection is also common and \nif the discharge has more of a ‘cottage cheese’ appearance \nassociated with itch then a culture should be performed \nand the infection treated with topical anti-yeast \ncream.\nPruritus\nItch is a common complaint in pregnancy. There are \na number of pregnancy-related conditions that manifest \nwith pruritus, including intrahepatic cholestasis of \npregnancy with the itch often worse in the palms of \nthe hands and soles of the feet. This is associated with \nabnormal liver function tests and an increased risk of \nfetal death in utero. Evaluation and treatment should \nbe prompt and delivery should be considered from 37 \nweeks’ gestation. Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques \nof pregnancy (PUPPS) is the most common dermatosis \nof pregnancy, which usually resolves soon after delivery \nand has no significant increase in fetal morbidity. The \nitch is likely to be on the abdomen, thighs, arms and \nbuttocks.\nb\t The Latin word for ‘childbirth’.\n",

If GBS is present, then \nantibiotic cover and consideration for induction of \nlabour is recommended.\nAbdominal pain\nThroughout pregnancy, the uterine muscle contracts \nand relaxes. When this is a painless process, it is termed \na Braxton–Hicks contraction. Once these become \npainful and regular, they are termed contractions. The \nnature of contractions is that they are intermittent and \nassociated with uterine firmness, with the pain being \nin the abdomen and mid–lower back.\nConstant or instantly severe abdominal pain in \npregnancy should receive prompt assessment. Placental \nabruption, which may be concealed or associated with \nvaginal bleeding, can cause constant, severe pain. There \nis usually also frequent uterine activity with no period \nof relaxation. The other, potentially catastrophic causes \nof abdominal pain include uterine rupture, which is \nusually associated with previous uterine surgery or \nprolonged, obstructed labour. In all cases the mother \nand the fetus should be examined. Non-obstetric causes \nof abdominal pain include ruptured viscera and hepatic \ncapsule oedema as well as causes seen outside of \npregnancy.\nHeadache\nHeadache in pregnancy deserves special consideration \nas it may be the symptom of more ominous pathology \nsuch as cerebral irritation or haemorrhagic stroke \nassociated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy \nsuch as pre-eclampsia. Migraine can also manifest in \npregnancy and should be treated initially with simple \nanalgesia and hydration.\nOedema\nPedal and hand oedema in the third trimester is almost \nuniversal and transient in nature. More significant \noedema that occurs over the course of a few days or \naffects the face should trigger evaluation of the blood \npressure and urinalysis to exclude pre-eclampsia.\nHISTORY\n(See Questions box 39.2.)\nIf the fetal movements are decreased, fetal evaluation \nwith electronic heart rate monitoring and ultrasound \nshould be under­taken and, once full term is reached, \ndelivery should be considered.\nVaginal bleeding\nVaginal bleeding in pregnancy is never normal, but it \nis relatively common. In early pregnancy it may be \nassociated with miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy or \noccur as a result of a subchorionic haematoma. In the \nsecond and third trimesters, vaginal bleeding may herald \nmore sinister pathology. The three diagnoses that should \nbe excluded include placental abruption (separation \nof the placenta from the uterine wall), placenta praevia \n(when the placenta is near or covering the cervical os) \nand vasa praevia (vessels containing fetal blood cross \nthe cervical os). Non-pregnancy-related causes are \nalso possible including trauma, malignancy and \ncervical polyp.\nInvestigation should include a full history, abdominal \nand vaginal examinations and bloods, including full \nblood count and Kleihauer (a test to assess the amount \nof fetal haemoglobin). Prompt resuscitation of the \nmother is required if there is significant haemorrhage.\nRupture of membranes\nWhen the ‘waters break’, or rupture of the membranes \n(amnion and chorion) occurs, the colour of the liquor \nshould be assessed. The liquor should be clear (not \ncloudy) and pale yellow in colour. Light bloodstaining \nmay cause the fluid to become pink and is also \nacceptable. Cloudy, offensive, brown or green liquor \nshould be addressed quickly. In the setting of ruptured \nmembranes prior to 37 weeks’ gestation, infection is \noften the cause and should be treated.

      "text": "734\t\nSECTION 11  WOMEN’S HEALTH HISTORY AND EXAMINATION\nCurrent pregnancy history\nFirstly, the EDC should be confirmed and agreed upon \nwith the woman. The antenatal screening tests should \nbe checked: blood group and antibodies, rubella, \nsyphilis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV serology, \nmidstream urine culture and full blood count. If \nanaemia is present, serum ferritin and thalassaemia \nscreening should also be performed. Glucose tolerance \ntesting should be undertaken at around 28 weeks and \ngroup B streptococcus (GBS) should be screened for \nafter 36 weeks.\nFirst-trimester screening for aneuploidy and \nsecond-trimester morphological ultrasound examination \nresults should be reviewed. The morphology, or fetal \nanomaly ultrasound, includes placental location and \ncervical length assessment to screen for placenta praevia \nand cervical shortening respectively. Cervical length \nis most accurately measured by transvaginal ultrasound. \nA shortened cervix is a risk factor for preterm delivery \nand treatment should be considered.\nReviewing the antenatal record also gives an \noverview of the examination findings over previous \nvisits. Trends in blood pressure and fundal height over \ntime give an indication of whether the pregnancy is \nprogressing normally.\nPast obstetric history\nA detailed history of each prior pregnancy, regardless \nof outcome, should be obtained. Recurrent miscarriage \n(three or more first-trimester miscarriages or any \nsecond-trimester miscarriage) warrants investigation \nfor underlying cause.\nPast intrapartum and postnatal events such as \npreterm delivery, caesarean section, postpartum \nhaemorrhage, shoulder dystocia and third / fourth-degree \nperineal tears should be noted and an appropriate \nscreening, prevention and / or management plan \nformulated.\nPast gynaecological history\nFind out whether the patient has received human \npapillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. The antenatal period \nis an appropriate opportunity for a full maternal \nhealth check. This includes cervical screening history; \nwhether it is up to date and normal. If there have \nbeen previous abnormal results, were they treated and \nhow many times? If there has been more than one \ntreatment for cervical abnormalities, or a cone biopsy, \nthe woman should be considered for transvaginal \nultrasound cervical length screening from 14 weeks’ \ngestation.\nIt is important to ask about a history of sexually \ntransmitted infections, especially Chlamydia trachomatis, \nNeisseria gonorrhoeae and herpes simplex virus \n(HSV), syphilis (Treponema pallidum) and human \nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) as these can be screened \nfor and treated as they can potentially affect the fetus \nand newborn.\nPast medical history\nThis should include all pre-existing medical conditions. \nImportantly, women should be questioned regarding \na history of cardiac, respiratory, renal, endocrine and \nneurological disease. Commonly overlooked chronic \nconditions such as rheumatic fever and cardiac valve \nreplacement, epilepsy, asthma, hypertension, diabetes, \nthromboembolic events or depression should be \nspecifically asked about. Previous surgeries, particularly \nabdominal or pelvic procedures, should be noted and \noperative notes obtained in the event that a caesarean \nsection is required so that intraoperative complications \ncan be predicted.\nIt is routine for a screening tool for depression, \nfor example the Edinburgh Depression Scale, to be \nadministered at least once during the antenatal period. \nThis is usually performed at the booking visit by the \nmidwife. Antenatal depression is one of the strongest \npredictors of postnatal depression.\nTreatment history\nThe treatment history is very important, especially in \nregard to the fetus. All medications have a pregnancy \ncategory rating (List 39.3).6 All medications rated other \nthan category A should be risk-assessed against the \nbenefits and, if appropriate, changed after consultation \nwith the patient. All women should be advised to take \n0.5 mg of folic acid per day for 3 months prior to \npregnancy and through the first trimester to reduce \nthe risk of fetal neural tube defects. High-dose folic \nacid (5 mg / day) is recommended for high-risk groups \nof women—for example, type 1 diabetes, women on \nantiepileptic medication, those with a body mass index \n(BMI) >35 and those with a previous history of a fetus \nwith a neural tube defect.

For \nabdominal palpation, the woman should not lie flat if \nuncomfortable, but be at approximately 30°, with a \npillow or bed head tilt. If the patient must lie flat, she \nshould be placed with a slight left lateral tilt, using a \npillow under the right hip / flank, to avoid venocaval \ncompression.\nGeneral appearance\nThe woman should have her height and weight measured \nat her booking visit, and BMI calculated. The weight \nshould be measured at subsequent visits in underweight, \nnormal prepregnancy BMI should gain 10–15 kg \nthroughout the entire pregnancy. This should be more \nif the woman is underweight and less if overweight \nor obese.\nFood hygiene should be discussed during pregnancy \nin order to avoid both food poisoning and food-\nassociated infectious diseases such as Toxoplasmosis \n(unwashed salads and fruit), Listeria (soft cheeses, \nuncooked meat, unpasteurised milk, pâté) and \nSalmonella (raw eggs, uncooked meat).\nPregnancy is a time of increased risk of domestic \nviolence for some women.

These anatomical changes \nare just two of the reasons a regional anaesthetic is \npreferred in the pregnant woman.\nInitial antenatal visit examination should include \nexamination of the thyroid for goitre or nodules. A \nroutine breast examination can be performed; as well \nas screening for breast masses, the breasts can be \nassessed for nipple inversion, asymmetry or previous \nsurgery. All of these factors may influence breastfeeding \nand an antenatal lactation consultation may be of \nbenefit. Women should be encouraged to perform their \nown breast checks routinely and can be educated on \nthe procedure at this time.\nThe abdomen: mother and \nfetal findings\nThe symphyseal–fundal height (SFH) is measured from \nthe fundus of the uterus in the midline, to the symphysis \npubis with a non-elastic measuring tape (Fig. 39.1). \nBy 20 weeks the fundus of the uterus should be at the \nlevel of the umbilicus. After this, the SFH in centimetres \nshould equate to the number of weeks’ gestation of the \npregnancy, with an allowable margin of up to 3 cm. It \nshould be recorded at each visit and the trend can be \nobserved over time. There can be discrepancy in the \nmeasurements if: the EDC is incorrectly calculated, \nthe woman is overweight / obese, uterine fibroids are \npresent, there is a multiple pregnancy, and there are \nabnormalities in either fetal growth or liquor volume. \nIf there is any clinical concern over the SFH \nmeasurement, the woman should be referred for an \nultrasound assessment.\nLeopold manoeuvres (Fig. 39.2) can be used to \npalpate the gravid uterus in the second and third \ntrimester to assess fetal lie, presentation, position and \nengagement into the maternal pelvis. Fetal lie is the \nrelation of the fetal long axis to the maternal long axis, \nand is described as longitudinal, transverse or oblique. \nFetal presentation describes the fetal part that is foremost \nwithin the maternal pelvis, or closest to it. Presentations \ninclude cephalic (head presenting) and breech (sacrum, \nknees or feet presenting). Malpresentations such as \nshoulder, brow, face or umbilical cord are also possible \noverweight and obese patients to monitor weight \nchanges in pregnancy and guide treatment. Referral \nto a dietitian early in the pregnancy may be beneficial \nfor these women. Those women with increased BMI \nshould also be referred to anaesthetic services antenatally \nfor assessment should the need arise for regional \nanalgesia in labour or caesarean section.\nAll women should be examined for pallor and \njaundice. Anaemia due to iron deficiency is common \nin pregnancy. Anaemia due to vitamin B12 or folate \ndeficiency or thalassaemia can occur, but is less \ncommon. Jaundice may result from viral hepatitis, \ngallstones, drug-induced or pregnancy-related causes \nsuch as AFLP (acute fatty liver of pregnancy), obstetric \ncholestasis, pre-eclampsia or HELLP (Haemolysis, \nElevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets) syndrome.\nObservations\nBlood pressure should be measured at each antenatal \nvisit or presentation. Physiological changes in the \ncardiovascular system of peripheral vasodilation \nand increased cardiac output give rise to profound \nhaemodynamic changes during pregnancy. During the \nfirst and second trimester, the blood pressure usually \nfalls for both systole and diastole. Diastolic blood \npressure may be unrecordable owing to the decreased \nperipheral resistance of the maternal circulation. The \nblood pressure then returns to prepregnancy values \nin the third trimester.\nThe heart rate usually increases 10–20 beats per \nminute above baseline rate, although a persisting heart \nrate of over 100 b.p.m. should always be investigated \nfor a cause.\nThe hands\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is common in pregnancy, as \ndiscussed above. The tingling, numbness and pain can \nbe recreated by pressing on the anterior aspect of the \nwrist. Anaemia can cause palmar crease pallor.\nThe face\nPeriorbital and generalised facial oedema can be a sign \nof pre-eclampsia. This can be difficult to determine if \nyou have not examined the patient previously. Often \nwhen questioned the patient or her partner will \nvolunteer a recent history of facial swelling.\n",

If the presenting part is unable to be \nidentified, an ultrasound should be performed to \nconfirm the presentation, especially after 36 weeks’ \ngestation. Fetal position refers to the relation of fetal \npart to the right or left side. Most commonly, if the fetus \nis in a cephalic presentation the fetal occiput is described \nas being anterior (OA), posterior (OP) or transverse \n(ROT or LOT) (Fig. 39.4). Engagement is measured \nabdominally as the proportion of the fetal head that \nhas descended into the maternal pelvis. It is expressed \nin fifths, and can be described as fifths palpable \nabdominally or as fifths in the pelvis. The fetal head \nmay engage prior to labour or after the start of labour, \nespecially in multiparous women.\nOnce the uterus has been palpated and the fetal \norientation identified, the fetal heart rate should be \nauscultated. This is usually done over the anterior-most \nshoulder with either a Pinard stethoscope or an electronic \nDoppler fetal heart rate monitor. The heart rate should \nbe between 110 and 160 b.p.m. in the third trimester. \nA faster heart rate may be heard if the fetus is active \nand auscultation should continue until it returns below \n160 b.p.m. If a slower heart rate is auscultated, comparison \nshould be made with the maternal heart rate to ensure \nit is not the maternal rate being detected. If it is not, \nthe woman should be positioned into a left lateral position. \nIf there is no recovery of the fetal heart rate over the \nfollowing 30 seconds, immediate assistance should be \nsought.\nDuring labour the fetal heart rate can be assessed \neither by intermittent auscultation or by continuous \nelectronic fetal heart rate monitoring. The method will \nbe determined by the risk factors present in the patient. \nLocal electronic fetal heart rate assessment tools should \nbe consulted. An example of these can be found at \nwww.ranzcog.edu.au or www.rcog.org.uk.\nThe genitals\nExamination of the external genitalia may reveal vaginal \ndischarge or vulval lesions such as HSV. If the symptoms \nsuggest further examination is warranted, this usually \nbegins with a speculum examination (see Ch 40). The \nlabia majora and minora are carefully parted and the \nspeculum (usually a Graves speculum) is passed with \ngentle downward pressure along the posterior vaginal \nwall. Once the speculum has been inserted as far as it \nwill easily go, the speculum can be opened until the \ncervix can be directly visualised. The cervix is usually \nChanges in fundal height with pregnancy. \nWeeks 10 to 12: uterus within pelvis; fetal \nheartbeat can be detected with Doppler. \nWeek 12: uterus palpable just above \nsymphysis pubis. Week 16: uterus palpable \nhalfway between symphysis and umbilicus; \nballottement of fetus is possible by \nabdominal and vaginal examination.

The first \nfeature is cervical dilation, which is measured in \ncentimetres. This is how open the cervix is at the level \nof the internal os when the examination starts, not \nafter manipulation. During the first stage of labour the \ncervix dilates to ‘full’ dilation at 10 cm, when the start \nof the second stage of labour begins. The second feature \nis cervical length (effacement), which starts at 3–4 cm \nand effaces to become ‘paper’ thin. The third feature \nis consistency, which is described as soft, medium or \nfirm. The prelabour cervix is firm, similar in consistency \nto the tip of the nose, and gradually softens as labour \nprogresses. The fourth feature is the cervical position, \nwhich describes whether the cervix has started to move \nfrom the initial ‘posterior’ position, through to ‘mid’ \nposition or has progressed to an ‘anterior’ position. \nThe final feature is station of the presenting part. This \nis measured in centimetres above or below the ischial \nspines, which are located at approximately 5 and 7 \no’clock in the vagina. During labour the vaginal \nexamination should also include assessment of fetal \nhead position, application to the cervix, caput and \nmoulding.\nThe lower limbs\nThe lower limbs should be examined with the patient \nlying. Initial inspection should assess for oedema; often \nthe patient should be asked to clarify whether the level \nof oedema is usual or increased. If oedema is present, \nthe level of pitting should be checked from the ankle \nupwards on both sides. The calves and ankles can be \npalpated for tenderness consistent with deep vein \nthrombosis.\nIf hypertension is present, neurological signs are \neasily elicited in the lower limbs. Patella reflexes in \npregnancy are usually normal to brisk and a tendon \nhammer is rarely required. Clonus is best assessed in \nthe ankle joint by moving the foot in a quick upward \nmotion to flex the joint. One or two beats are acceptable \nin pregnancy. Increased reflexes and / or clonus may \nreflect neurological irritation in the setting of \npre-eclampsia and should be addressed in a timely \nfashion.\n",

It also includes complications of early pregnancy \nsuch as miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy.\nHISTORY\nAs with all areas of medicine a precise and comprehensive \nhistory is the most important component in making \nan accurate gynaecological diagnosis. The basic \nstructure of the gynaecological history is similar to \nthat for other systems, but with more emphasis on \nthe patient’s menstrual, sexual and past reproductive \nhistory. It is important to note the patient’s age as \nthis will influence the likely diagnosis for a number \nof presenting problems. Occupation may be relevant \nboth to the level of understanding that can be assumed \nand to the effect of different gynaecological problems \non the patient’s life.\nA method for the gynaecological history and \nexamination is given in Text box 40.1.\nPresenting symptoms\nAsk the patient to describe the nature of her problem. \nWhere there are multiple symptoms these may not be \nrelated to the same pathology and it is useful to address \neach of these in turn with appropriate open and closed \nquestioning. Ascertain the timescale of the problem \nand, where appropriate, the circumstances surrounding \nthe onset of symptoms and their relationship to the \nmenstrual cycle. It is also important to discover the \ndegree of disability experienced for any given symptom. \nIn many situations, reassurance that there is no serious \nunderlying pathology will provide sufficient ‘treatment’, \nbecause the actual disability may be minimal.\nMore detailed questions will depend on the nature \nof the presenting complaint. List 40.1 outlines some \nof the more common presenting symptoms encountered \nin the outpatient clinic.

In most cases the cause is an \nimbalance in the mechanisms that regulate clotting at \nthe endometrial level without any obvious structural \npathology. However, it may be associated with a number \nof benign pathologies and, occasionally, with malignancy \n(see List 40.2).\nDiagnosis\nIn practice, the diagnosis of HMB is made on the basis \nof symptoms, not measured blood loss. Symptoms of \nclotting, flooding (soiling of clothing), the use of a \nlarge amount of sanitary protection, bleeding lasting \nmore than 7 days and treatment for anaemia are likely \nto indicate HMB. A change in the pattern of bleeding \nis more likely to be associated with a structural lesion. \nMalignancy is rare in women under the age of 40. \nA history of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), \ndiabetes, hypertension and / or obesity is associated \nwith an increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia and \nmalignancy.\nAll women with HMB should have a general \nexamination for signs of anaemia and thyroid disease \nand a pelvic examination including a Pap smear (P). \nThe finding of a pelvic mass is most likely to be \nassociated with a diagnosis of fibroids (see Fig. 40.1) \nbut can indicate malignancy.\nA full blood count (FBC) should be requested for all \npatients with HMB. Additional investigation is mainly \ndirected at excluding malignancy and usually includes \na pelvic ultrasound scan. Endoscopic examination of \nthe endometrial cavity (hysteroscopy) with endometrial \nbiopsy is indicated when:\n•\t there is a history of irregular or intermenstrual \nbleeding\n•\t risk factors for endometrial cancer are present\n•\t pelvic examination is abnormal\n•\t there is no response to first-line treatment.\nYoung women under the age of 25 should have a partial \ncoagulation screen to exclude Von Willebrand’s disease.\nBleeding in early pregnancy\nAny women of reproductive age presenting with \nabnormal vaginal bleeding should have the possibility \nof pregnancy considered. If a pregnancy test is positive, \nthe cause of the bleeding can usually be determined by \na combination of vaginal examination and ultrasound \n(see Table 40.1). The most common cause of bleeding \nin early pregnancy (before 20 weeks) is miscarriage, \nalthough hydatidiform and ectopic pregnancy may also \npresent with bleeding. Miscarriage is the spontaneous \ntermination of pregnancy prior to 20 weeks’ gestation; \nit affects about 15–20% of pregnancies. It is important \nto remember that bleeding in pregnancy can result \nfrom the same lower genital tract lesions as in non-\npregnant women.\nAmenorrhoea and oligomenorrhoea\nThe onset of the first period, the menarche, commonly \noccurs at 12 years of age and can be considered to be \nabnormally early at 7 years. Primary amenorrhoea is \nthe absence of menarche. The age at which the diagnosis \nis made depends on the presence or absence of other \nfeatures of puberty. In the absence of other signs of \npuberty this is 14 years, but where there are other \npubertal changes it is 16.\nSecondary amenorrhoea is defined as the cessation \nof menses for 6 months or more in a woman who has \npreviously menstruated. Oligomenorrhoea is the \noccurrence of five or fewer periods over 12 months. \nIn practice, the distinction between the two can be \nsomewhat arbitrary as they share many of the same \ncauses.\nCAUSES OF HEAVY MENSTRUAL \nBLEEDING\nStructural\n• \nUterine leiomyomata (fibroids)\n• \nAdenomyosis\n• \nEndometrial polyps\n• \nEndometrial hyperplasia\n• \nEndometrial cancer\nNon-structural\n• \nDisorders of ovulation (polycystic ovary \nsyndrome, perimenopause, puberty)\n• \nClotting disorders\n• \nIatrogenic (intrauterine contraceptive device)\n• \nDysfunctional bleeding (see above)\n• \nHypothyroidism\nLIST 40.2 \n",

The possibility \nof pregnancy should be excluded in any woman of \nreproductive age by undertaking a urinary pregnancy \ntest. Ask about recent emotional stress, changes in \nweight, menopausal symptoms and current medication. \nRelevant findings on examination are a low or high \nbody mass index, hirsutism (PCOS), galactorrhoea and \nbitemporal hemianopia (pituitary tumours).\nIn cases of primary amenorrhoea look for features \nof secondary sex characteristics development, signs \nof imperforate hymen (P) and features of Turner’s \nsyndrome (short stature, wide carrying angle and \nwidely spaced nipples).\nThe differential diagnosis is established by \nmeasurement of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), \nluteinising hormone (LH) and prolactin, and thyroid \nfunction tests. A pelvic ultrasound can provide \nadditional evidence of polycystic ovary syndrome \n(POCS), ovarian tumours and abnormalities of the lower \ngenital tract.

It usually develops \nwithin the first 2 years of the menarche. The pain is \ntypically described as central and cramping. Symptoms \ncan be severely incapacitating, causing major disruption \nof social activities. The onset of symptoms is usually \nassociated with the onset of menstrual blood loss \nbut may begin on the day preceding menstruation. \nThe pain occurs only in ovulatory cycles and often \ndisappears or improves after the birth of the first child. \nDysmenorrhoea may be associated with vomiting and \ndiarrhoea. Pelvic examination reveals no abnormality \nof the pelvic organs.\nSecondary or acquired dysmenorrhoea is more \nlikely to be caused by organic pelvic pathology and \nusually has its onset many years after the menarche. \nCommonly associated pathologies include endometriosis \n(see Fig. 40.2), adenomyosis, pelvic infections and \nintrauterine lesions such as submucous fibroid \npolyps.\nSymptoms and examination\nUltrasound\nDiagnosis\nLight vaginal bleeding with minimal \npain; closed cervix\nViable intrauterine pregnancy\nThreatened miscarriage\nHeavy vaginal bleeding with cramping \nlower abdominal pain; open cervix\nProducts of conception in uterus \nwith or without fetal heartbeat\nInevitable miscarriage\nHeavy vaginal bleeding with cramping; \nopen cervix, possibly with tissue\nProducts of conception in uterus, \nusually without fetal heartbeat\nIncomplete miscarriage\nPainless light bleeding or no symptoms; \nclosed cervix\nNo fetal pole or fetal heartbeat in \ngestation sac >25 mm diameter\nMissed miscarriage\nMinimal bleeding after history of heavier \nbleeding and cramps; closed cervix\nEmpty uterus\nComplete miscarriage (also \nconsider ectopic pregnancy and \nvery early viable pregnancy)\nMild-to-moderate bleeding; uterus large \nfor dates, exaggerated pregnancy \nsymptoms (e.g. hyperemesis)\nSnowstorm appearance with or \nwithout gestation sac\nMolar pregnancy\nLight vaginal bleeding with unilateral \nabdominal pain; closed cervix; cervical \nexcitation\nNo intrauterine pregnancy when \nhCG >1500; free fluid outside the \nuterus and / or an adnexal mass\nEctopic pregnancy\nhCG = human chorionic gonadotrophin.\nTABLE 40.1 \nDiagnosis of bleeding in early pregnancy\n",

On \nexamination, identify the site of maximal tenderness \nand the presence of rebound tenderness and guarding. \nIt is vital to always exclude pregnancy, particularly \nectopic pregnancy.\nOvarian torsion usually occurs in the presence of \nan enlarged ovary. Women with torsion present with \nsudden onset of sharp, unilateral pelvic pain that is \noften accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The \nsonographic findings are variable. The ovary is enlarged \nand can be seen in an abnormal location above or \nbehind the uterus. The absence of blood flow is an \nimportant sign, and a lack of venous wave form on \nDoppler ultrasound has a high positive predictive value. \nInvestigations\nA careful history is of great importance in this condition. \nPelvic examination should be performed and, if this \nis abnormal, a pelvic ultrasound scan arranged. \nLaparoscopy is the gold standard investigation for the \ndiagnosis of conditions such as endometriosis. It is \nperformed in cases with primary dysmenorrhoea only \nif the condition is particularly resistant to therapy.\nAcute abdominal pain\nIn women with a negative pregnancy test and acute \npelvic pain, gynaecological disorders include pelvic \ninflammatory disease (PID), functional ovarian cysts, \novarian or peritoneal endometriosis and ovarian torsion. \nThe most common gastrointestinal causes that can \npresent with acute pelvic pain include appendicitis, \nacute sigmoid diverticulitis and Crohn’s disease.

If the torsion is reversed \nearly in the process, the ovary may be saved.\nApproximately 1% of pregnancies are ectopic (occur \noutside the uterus) but the individual risk depends on \nthe past history (see Table 40.2). Ectopic pregnancy \npresents classically with sudden onset of unilateral \npain and irregular vaginal bleeding after a period of \namenorrhoea. The presence of shoulder tip pain (due to \ndiaphragmatic irritation) and peritonism are suggestive \nof rupture with intraperitoneal bleeding. In practice, \nit is rare for all three symptoms to be present and \nchronic presentation with atypical pain and bleeding are \nmore common. Clinical examination findings include \ncervical excitation (increased pain on movement of \nthe cervix during pelvic examination), adnexal pain \nand swelling with or without signs of hypovolaemic \nshock. The diagnosis is usually made by measurement \nof human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) levels \nand pelvic ultrasound and confirmed at laparoscopy \n(see Table 40.1).\nInfertility\nApproximately 80% of normally fertile couples will \nconceive within a year of unprotected intercourse; \nwhen conception does not occur within 12 months \nthe couple can be considered at risk of infertility. \nThe median prevalence of infertility in the developed \nworld at 12 months of unprotected intercourse is 9%, \nalthough this varies significantly in relation to age \nin women. Infertility is called primary if the woman \nhas not previously been pregnant and secondary if \nshe has had one or more previous pregnancies. Table \n40.3 summarises the common causes of infertility (note \nthat it is not uncommon for more than one factor to \naffect fertility in a given couple).

In women complaining of \ndisorders of sexual function and suspected sexually \ntransmitted infection (such as vaginal discharge, PID), \na full sexual history should be obtained, as described \nin Questions box 40.2.\nAlways explain the reason you need to ask questions \nof such a personal nature. For example, ‘From what \nyou have told me I think some of these problems may \nhave a sexual cause. Will it be all right if I ask you \nsome personal questions?’\nPrevious gynaecological \nhistory\nA detailed history of any previous gynaecological \nproblems and treatments must be recorded. The \namount of detail needed about previous pregnancies will \ndepend on the presenting symptom. In most cases the \nnumber of previous pregnancies and their outcome \n(miscarriage, ectopic or delivery after 20 weeks) is all that is \nrequired.\nFor all women of reproductive age who are sexually \nactive it is essential to ask about contraception. This \nis important not only to determine the possibility of \npregnancy but also because the method of contraception \nused may itself be relevant to the presenting symptom. \nFor women over the age of 25, ask about the date and \nresult of the last cervical Pap smear.\nPrevious medical history\nTake particular account of any history of medical \ndisorders of the endocrine, urinary or cardiovascular \nsystems. Make a record of all current medications and \nany known drug allergies.\nFamily and social history\nA social history is important for all problems but is \nparticularly relevant where the presenting difficulties \nrelate to abortion or sterilisation. Ask about smoking, \nalcohol and other recreational drug use. A family history \nof breast or ovarian cancer or both, delayed puberty \nor premature menopause may be relevant where the \npatient has the same condition.\nINITIAL ASSESSMENT OF THE INFERTILE \nCOUPLE\n1.\t How long have you been trying to fall \npregnant?\n2.\t What methods of contraception did you \nuse previously?\n3.\t Have either you or your partner had a \nprevious pregnancy together or with other \npartners?\n4.\t If so, did you have any complications \nassociated with the pregnancy?\n5.\t Can you tell me about your periods and \nwhether you have had any bleeding \nbetween your periods?\n6.\t How often do you and your partner have \nsex? Are there any problems with pain \nduring sex or ejaculatory / erection \nproblems for your partner?\n7.\t Have you ever had any sexually \ntransmitted infections or has your partner \never had mumps orchitis (inflammation of \nthe testes)?\n8. Do you have any serious chronic illness or \nhave you ever had surgery such as an \nappendectomy? Has your partner been \ntreated for varicocele or undescended \ntestes?\nQUESTIONS BOX 40.1 \nDiagnosis\nClinical examination findings of significance for women \ninclude those features potentially associated with \ncauses of amenorrhoea (see above) and endometriosis. \nMale examination findings include testicular size, the \npresence of varicocele and thickening of the epididymis \n(see Ch 18). Initial investigations are determined by the \nhistory; for example, if this is suggestive of previous \npelvic infection, an assessment of tubal patency would \nbe a priority. Typically, initial baseline tests include \nsemen fluid analysis, assessment of ovulation (such \nas a day 21 serum progesterone level) and assessment \nof tubal patency (such as hysterosalpingogram or \nlaparoscopy).\n",

Available at www.gmc-uk.org/\nguidance.htm.)\nGuidelines for intimate examination3\nWhen conducting intimate examinations you \nshould:\nExplain to the patient why an intimate \nexamination is necessary and give the patient \nan opportunity to ask questions.\nExplain what the examination will involve, in a \nway the patient can understand, so that the \npatient has a clear idea of what to expect, \nincluding any potential pain or discomfort.\nObtain the patient’s permission before the \nexamination and be prepared to discontinue \nthe examination if the patient asks you to.\nRecord that permission has been obtained.\nKeep discussion relevant and avoid unnecessary \npersonal comments.\nOffer a chaperone. If the patient does not want \na chaperone, you should record that the offer \nwas made and declined. If a chaperone is \npresent, you should record that fact and \nmake a note of the chaperone’s identity. If for \njustifiable practical reasons you cannot offer a \nchaperone, you should explain to the patient \nand, if possible, offer to delay the examination \nto a later date.\nGive the patient privacy to undress and dress \nand use drapes to maintain the patient’s \ndignity. Do not assist the patient in removing \nclothing unless you have clarified with them \nthat your assistance is required.\nObtain consent prior to anaesthetisation, usually \nin writing, for the intimate examination of \nanaesthetised patients. If you are supervising \nstudents you should ensure that valid consent \nhas been obtained before they carry out any \nintimate examination.\nTEXT BOX 40.2 \nEXAMINATION\nA general examination should always be performed at \nthe first consultation, including assessment of pulse, \nblood pressure and temperature. Take careful note of \nany signs of anaemia. The distribution of facial and \nbody hair is often important, as hirsutism may be a \npresenting symptom of androgen-producing tumours \nor PCOS. Also record the patient’s body weight and \nheight.\nThe intimate nature of the gynaecological \nexamination makes it especially important to ensure \nthat every effort is made to consider privacy and that \nthe examination is not interrupted (see Text box 40.2). \nThe examination should ideally take place in a separate \narea to the consultation. Allow the patient to undress \nin privacy and, if necessary, empty her bladder first. \nAfter she has undressed there should be no undue \ndelay to the examination.\nExamination of the breasts\nBreast examination should be performed if there are \nsymptoms or if the patient is over the age of 45. The \npresence of the secretion of milk at times not associated \nwith pregnancy, known as galactorrhoea, may indicate \nthe presence of pituitary disease. Palpation with the \nflat of the hand should be undertaken in each of the \nfour quadrants of each breast to exclude the presence \nof any nodules. See Chapter 41 for further details on \nbreast examination.\nExamination of the abdomen\nInspection of the abdomen is undertaken as previously \ndescribed in Chapters 14 and 18. In a patient presenting \nwith gynaecological symptoms look for the presence \nof a mass as well as scars, striae and hernias. If there \nis a mass, try to determine whether it is fixed or mobile, \nsmooth or regular, and whether it arises from the pelvis \n(you should not be able to palpate the lower edge above \nthe pubic bone). Look for scars in the umbilicus from \nprevious laparoscopies and in the suprapubic region \nwhere transverse incisions from caesarean sections and \nmost gynaecological operations are found. Palpate the \nabdomen to assess for any guarding or rebound \ntenderness. Check the hernial orifices and feel for any \nenlarged lymph nodes in the groin. Percuss the abdomen \nto outline the limits of a tumour, detect the presence \nof a full bladder or recognise the presence of tympanic \nloops of bowel.\nPelvic examination\nThe pelvic examination should be performed when \nindicated as the final part of any complete physical \nexamination.4 It should not be considered an automatic \nand inevitable part of every gynaecological consultation. \n",

They are normally the \nsize of a pea but when the duct becomes blocked a \ncyst can form. These cysts may present acutely as an \noval-shaped lump—in the posterior labia they may \nsometimes grow to the size of a golf ball or larger. They \nare usually unilateral and cause discomfort with \nwalking, sitting and sexual intercourse. When the gland \nis infected, most commonly with skin or genitourinary \nbacteria (Staphylococcus, Escherichia coli), an abscess \ncan develop. These abscesses arise more acutely than \nBartholin’s cysts and are particularly painful.\nSpeculum examination\nSpeculum examination should be performed before \ndigital examination to avoid any contamination with \nlubricant. A bivalve speculum is most commonly used \nwith the patient in the supine position as this enables \na clear view of the cervix to be obtained. Where vaginal \nwall prolapse is suspected, a Sims’ speculum should \nbe used as an alternative with the patient in the left \nlateral position as this affords a better view of the \nanterior vaginal wall (see Fig. 40.6).\nPart the labia minora with the left hand and insert \nthe speculum into the introitus, initially with the widest \ndimension of the instrument in the anteroposterior \norientation and turning gently to the transverse position \nas the tip passes the introitus, as the vagina is widest \nin this direction. When the speculum reaches the top \nof the vagina, gently open the blades to enable the \ncervix to be visualised. Note the presence of any \ndischarge or bleeding from the cervix and any polyps \nor areas of ulceration. If the clinical history suggests \npossible infection (see Table 40.5), take swabs from \nthe vaginal fornices and cervical os and place in a \ntransport medium to look for Candida, Trichomonas \nand Neisseria; take a separate swab from the endocervix \nto look for Chlamydia.\nYou should consider what information will be gained \nby the examination, whether this is a screening or \ndiagnostic procedure and whether it is necessary at \nthis time. In a child or in a woman with an intact \nhymen, speculum and pelvic examinations are not \nusually performed unless as part of an examination \nunder anaesthesia. Remember that a rough or painful \nexamination rarely produces any useful information and, \nin certain situations such as tubal ectopic pregnancy, \nmay be dangerous. Throughout the examination remain \nalert to verbal and non-verbal indications of distress \nfrom the patient.\nIt is essential to obtain informed consent and for \nmale students and doctors to have a female chaperone \n(see List 40.4). The patient’s privacy must be promised \nand ensured.\nWear gloves on both hands during vaginal and \nspeculum examinations. Examine the patient either in \nthe supine position or in the left lateral position with \nthe knees drawn up and separated (see Fig. 40.3). The \nleft lateral position is used when the woman cannot \nassume the lithotomy position or when a view of the \nanterior vaginal wall is required—for example, when \na urinary fistula is suspected (see below). The perineum \nshould be brightly illuminated by a lamp.\nExamination of the external genitalia\nParting the lips of the labia minora with the left hand, \nlook at the external urethral meatus and inspect the \nRULES FOR CONDUCTING A PELVIC \nEXAMINATION\nWhen conducting a vaginal examination you \nshould:\n• \nExplain that an intimate examination is \nneeded and why.\n• \nExplain what the examination will involve.\n• \nObtain the patient’s permission.\n• \nOffer a chaperone or invite the patient to \nbring a relative or friend.\n• \nAllow the patient to undress in privacy.\n• \nKeep discussion relevant and avoid \nunnecessary personal comments.\n• \nExplain findings and encourage questions \nand discussion.\nLIST 40.4 \na\t Caspar Bartholin Secundus (1655–1738), a professor of philosophy at \nCopenhagen at the age of 19, then professor of medicine, anatomy and \nphysics.

The appearance of a raised or ulcerated lesion \nwith irregular vessels on the surface is suggestive of \ncervical malignancy. Cervical polyps are common \nand may arise from the cervical canal or the external \nsurface. Occasionally, an endometrial polyp may \nprolapse through the cervical canal and appear at the \ncervical os.\nPap smear\nA Pap smear should be taken at least 6 weeks after \npregnancy and not during menstruation. The age at \nwhich routine screening starts and the frequency of \ntesting vary from country to country. In Australia from \nDec 2017 initial testing of samples will be for the \ndetection of HPV and cervical cytology will be \nperformed only on HPV-positive specimens. The \ntechnique for collecting the sample will remain as below.\nThe procedure is as follows. After inserting the \nspeculum as above, wipe away any discharge from the \nsurface of the cervix and take a 360° sweep with a \nsuitable spatula or brush pressed firmly against the \ncervix at the junction of the columnar epithelium of \nthe endocervical canal and the squamous epithelium \nof the ectocervix. There are two methods by which \ncells are transferred onto a slide for staining and \ninspection by a cytologist:\n1.\tIn a conventional Pap smear, the specimen is \nspread immediately onto a clear glass slide in a \nthin, even layer. The slide is fixed with 95% \nalcohol alone or in combination with 3% glacial \nacetic acid.\n2.\tIn liquid-based cytology (LBC), the sampling \ndevice is transferred into the preservative \nsolution vial by pushing the broom into the \nbottom of the vial 10 times, forcing the bristles \napart. The solution is then passed through a \nfilter, which traps the large squamous cells but \nallows smaller red cells, debris and bacteria to \npass through. The squamous cells are then \ntransferred to a slide.\nThe sensitivity of both methods for the detection of \nabnormal cells is similar, although the rate of \nunsatisfactory smears is lower in LBC. LBC also allows \nfor testing for human papillomavirus and Chlamydia \ninfection.\nis often a central area extending beyond the edge of the \nos that is a darker red and more velvety in appearance \n(see Fig. 40.9). This is sometimes called a cervical \nectropion and represents an outgrowth of healthy \ncolumnar epithelium beyond the cervical canal. This \nis a normal variant, although it may be associated with \nan increase in clear vaginal discharge and, on occasion, \ncontact bleeding. The columnar epithelium appears \nreddened because, unlike the stratified squamous \nepithelium of the ectocervix, there is only a single layer \nof columnar cells between the underlying capillaries \nand the surface. As the columnar epithelium is exposed \nto the acid pH of the vagina it tends to revert back to \nsquamous epithelium in a process called squamous \nmetaplasia. This sometimes traps islands of the \nmucus-secreting columnar epithelium below the surface \nof the new epithelium, leading to an accumulation \nof mucus in small retention cysts or Nabothian \nfollicles.\nIn women with cervicitis, the cervix appears \nreddened and may be ulcerated, and there is a \nmucopurulent discharge as the endocervix is invariably \ninvolved. The diagnosis is established by examination \nand taking cervical swabs for culture.\nSims’ speculum\n(From Symonds EM, Symonds IM. Essential obstetrics and gynaecology, \n4th edn.

Masses arising from the pelvis \ncan be distinguished by failure to identify a gap between \nthe mass and the symphysis pubis. The presence of \nscars from previous surgery or ascites should be noted.\nOn pelvic examination a pelvic space-occupying \nlesion may cause downward pressure leading to vaginal \nprolapse. A speculum examination is essential to exclude \na primary cervical lesion such as advanced cervical \ncancer, although this will normally present earlier with \nbleeding. The mass can then be assessed by bimanual \npalpation.

For example, a pedunculated fibroid may \nmimic an ovarian tumour, whereas a solid ovarian \ntumour, if adherent to the uterus, may be impossible \nto distinguish from a uterine fibroid. The ovaries may \nbe palpable in the normal pelvis if the patient is thin, \nbut the fallopian tubes are palpable only if they are \nsignificantly enlarged.\nPelvic mass\nTable 40.7 lists the common causes of a mass arising \nfrom the pelvis in women.

      "text": "CHAPTER 41 \nThe breasts: history and examination\nBlessed is the physician who takes a good history, looks keenly at his patient and thinks a bit.  \nWALTER C ALVAREZ (1976)\nBreast examination is a vitally important part of the \ngeneral physical examination. In women aged 40 and \nolder, a screening physical examination for breast cancer \nmay be advised (e.g. monthly self-examination by the \npatient and yearly examination by the doctor), but there \nis no convincing evidence of the value of breast \nself-examination.1\nEXAMINATION ANATOMY\nThe attachment of the female breast extends from the \nclavicle superiorly to the inframammary crease (sixth \nrib) inferiorly and from the sternum to the midaxillary \nline (see Fig. 41.1). The area covered is more rectangular \nthan circular. The axillary tail is an extension of the \nsuperolateral part of the breast up towards the axilla. \nThis tail extends along the lower border of the pectoralis \nmajor muscle and may abut the clavipectoral fascia, \nwhich separates this from the axillary lymph nodes.\nBreast tissue has fatty, glandular and fibrous \ncomponents, and the distribution is variable and \ndepends on age and weight. Women in their twenties \nwho are thin have very little fat. Most 80 year olds have \nvery little fibroglandular tissue.\nThere is a surrounding superficial fascia attached \nto the skin and pectoral fascia by ligaments. The normal \nbreast does not have a homogeneous feel but is \nsomewhat lumpy.\nThere are a number of benign abnormalities of the \nbreast that change the texture or appearance of the \nbreast, including:\n•\t fibroadenomas with overgrowth of connective \ntissue surrounding the ducts\n•\t cysts with obstruction of collecting ducts \n(however, it is not simply due to obstruction; it is \nhormonally mediated as they are much less \ncommon in postmenopausal women not on \nhormone replacement therapy [HRT])\n•\t intraductal papilloma, causing a nipple discharge \non the affected side (clear or bloodstained)\n•\t mammary duct ectasia, which causes nipple \ndischarge.\nHISTORY\nThe history is imperative. Essential questions to ask \ninclude the length of time any mass has been noticed, \nthe presence of pain, any change in size or texture over \ntime, relationship to the menstrual cycle, and any nipple \ndischarge. Ask whether the patient has conducted \nregular self-examinations and has discovered a change \nin her breast. Ask about previous breast surgery, biopsies \nor cyst aspirations, or recurrent abscesses (e.g. \ngranulomatous mastitis). Has the woman breastfed her \nbabies and for how long? Was breastfeeding difficult \nor associated with breast infection (mastitis)? Has she \nhad breast implants and have these caused any problems?\nHINT BOX\nRemember, pathological discharge is generally clear  \nor bloodstained; spontaneous (i.e. not expressed),  \nand uniduct. All other discharge—yellow / green /  \nwhite, multiduct, bilateral or not spontaneous—is \nphysiological.\nFind out about risk factors for breast cancer, \nincluding any family history of breast or ovarian cancer \n(and age when affected), previous personal history \nof breast cancer, obesity, early menarche and late \nmenopause, late first pregnancy, mantle radiation, heavy \n",

However, \nthree-quarters of patients presenting with a breast \ncancer have no known risk factors.\nAsk about genetic testing and mammography if \nrelevant. The breast cancer genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 \nare associated with a strong risk of breast (and ovarian) \ncancer, as well as breast cancer in men. Patients with \na strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer \nshould be asked whether genetic testing has been carried \nout. Screening mammography is generally recommended \nfor all women from the age of 50 years.2\nEnlargement of the male breasts (gynaecomastia; \np 476) is often a result of hormone or drug treatment \n(e.g. for carcinoma of the prostate or with aldactone). \nIt is often tender. Bilateral enlargement is usually benign, \nbut unilateral enlargement may be due to malignancy. \nAs malignancy is more common in men with \ngynaecomastia, asymmetrical enlargement should \narouse concern.

The patient should be offered \na chaperone.\nThe examination is only just over 50% sensitive for \ncarcinoma, but specificity is as high as 90%. The \nlikelihood ratio (LR) of a positive examination is 14.1 \nand the LR of a negative examination is 0.47.4\nInspection\nAsk the patient to sit up with the chest fully exposed. \nThere is controversy about the value of inspection of \nthe breasts as part of the examination, but advanced \ncancers may be obvious at this stage. Look at the nipples \nfor retraction (due to cancer or fibrosis; in some patients \nretraction may be normal, so it is important to ask \nwhether it is long-standing) and Paget’s disease of the \nbreast (where underlying breast cancer causes a unilateral \nrash or ulceration of the nipple). Asymmetry of breast \nsize is common, and it is important to ask whether any \nasymmetry is new.\nNext inspect the rest of the skin. Look for visible \nveins (which, if unilateral, suggest a cancer), skin \ndimpling and peau d’orange skin (where advanced, \nbreast cancer causes oedematous skin pitted by the \nsweat glands). Look for erythema from mastitis (the \narea will be hot and tender).\nA persistent erythematous plaque in the nipple area \nmay be contact dermatitis or skin irritation, but if \nasymmetrical or it has not responded to treatment this \nmay be malignant Paget’s disease of the breast.\nAsk the patient to raise the arms above the head \nand then lower them slowly. Look for tethering of the \nnipples or skin, a shift in the relative position of the \nnipples or a fixed mass distorting the breast (see \nFig. 41.2).\nNote whether there are any obvious visible masses \nin the axillae.\nNext ask the patient to rest the hands on the hips \nand then press the hands against the hips (the pectoral \ncontraction manoeuvre). This accentuates areas of \ndimpling or fixation.\nConditions unrelated to the breast may be found \nincidentally, such as pectus excavatum or carinatum, \ndistended veins related to inferior vena caval (IVC) \n",

You may feel normal rubbery-type plaques \n(fibroglandular tissue), especially in the upper outer \nquadrant. It is normal to feel firm breast tissue at the \nareola border, and the upper outer quadrant of the \nbreast is often dense.\nEVALUATION OF A \nBREAST LUMP\nThe following five points need to be carefully elucidated \nif a lump is detected.\n1.\tPosition: (see below).\n2.\tSize, shape and consistency: a hard, irregular \nnodule is characteristic of carcinoma; a firm, \nsmooth, very mobile, regular nodule is more \nlikely to be a fibroadenoma, especially in a young \nwoman.\n3.\tTenderness: suggests an inflammatory or a cystic \nlesion; breast cancer is usually not tender, \nalthough inflammatory breast cancer can be \nassociated with tenderness.\n4.\tFixation: mobility is determined by taking the \nbreast between the hands and moving it over the \nchest wall; in advanced carcinoma the lump may \nbe fixed to the chest wall.\n5.\tSingle or multiple lesions present: multiple \nnodules suggest benign cystic disease or \nfibroadenosis.\nRemember that lumps found on breast examination \nmay not involve breast tissue; these include lipomas \nand sebaceous cysts.\nRemember also that many normal breasts have \npalpable lumps and that, although benign lumps tend \nto be soft, moveable and regular, they can also have \nthe characteristics of malignant lumps.5 Causes of a \nlump in the breast are listed in Table 41.1.\nIn men with true gynaecomastia, a disc of breast \ntissue can be palpated under the areola. This is not \npresent in men who are merely obese.\nDocument your findings using the ‘clock system’: \nenvisage the breast like a clock with respect to the \nlocation of any lump or lesion indicated on the breast \n(e.g. 9 o’clock position) and the distance from the radial \nedge of the areola noted. The size of the mass and its \nother features must also be recorded (see above).\nNon-tender\nTender\nCyst\nCarcinoma\nFibrocystic disease*\nFibroadenoma (benign \nhighly mobile ‘breast \nmouse’)\nCyst\nBreast abscess\nFibroadenosis\nCostal cartilage chondritis\nInflammatory breast \ncancer\nUncommon causes:\nTrauma, fat necrosis\nOther cysts (e.g. galactocele)\nOther neoplasms (e.g. duct papilloma)\nGranulomatous mastitis (an inflammatory condition \nmimicking breast cancer)\nChest wall (e.g. lipoma, costal cartilage chondritis [causes \ntenderness but not a lump])\n*Clinically lumps in the breast are often ridges of fibroglandular tissue \nthat may become more prominent owing to changes in weight or \nhormonal influence. On imaging, the term ‘fibrocystic change’ is more \ncommonly used to describe sonographic changes that are likely \nbenign.\nTABLE 41.1 \nCauses of a breast lump\nT&O’C ESSENTIALS\n1.\t A palpable breast mass is likely to be significant \n(called a dominant mass) if it is:\n○\t clearly three-dimensional\n○\t distinct from the surrounding tissue\n○\t asymmetrical compared with the other breast\n○\t persistent throughout a menstrual cycle\n○\t not smooth, well-demarcated or mobile.\n2.\t A palpable breast mass is more likely to be \nmalignant if it has the following characteristics:\n○\t Very firm.\n○\t Margins seem poorly defined or have an \nirregular edge.\n○\t Immobile or fixed.\n○\t Associated skin dimpling.\n○\t Associated retraction of the nipple, or nipple \nscaling.\n○\t Bloody nipple discharge history.\n○\t Draining lymph nodes are palpable.\n",

The outer layer \ncontains pigmented cells and the inner layer, \nwhich is continuous with the optic nerve, \ncontains the photoreceptor rod (night and \nperipheral vision) and cone (central and colour \nvision) cells.\n•\t The central layer is called the uveal tract. It forms \nthe iris and ciliary body anteriorly and the choroid \nposteriorly. The choroid is a vascular structure. It \nsupplies the optic nerve, the fovea (area of most \nacute vision) and the posterior two-thirds of the \nretina. The ciliary body produces the aqueous \nhumour. This transparent fluid lies behind the \ncornea and fills the anterior chamber of the eye. \nThe aqueous humour moves through the pupil \nand drains through a trabecular meshwork at \nthe acute angle of the anterior chamber. The lens \nsits behind the cornea and is suspended from \nligaments of the ciliary body.\n•\t The outer layer is fibrous.

      "text": "772\t\nSECTION 12  SPECIALTY SYSTEM HISTORY AND EXAMINATION\nThe anatomy of the optic nerve is described in \nChapter 32.\nThe eyelids provide and distribute moisture to the \ncorneas from three types of glands (two small and one \nlarge). The two types of small lacrimal a glands within \nthe eyelids secrete tears and produce mucin and oil. \nThese are sufficient to lubricate the eyelids and the \ncornea in normal circumstances. Emotion or a foreign \nbody, however, will stimulate the large lacrimal glands \nthat lie between the bony orbital wall laterally and the \neyeball and the lateral rectus muscle medially. From \neach gland duct, big volumes of tears drain into the \nupper part of the lid. Tears either evaporate or are \ndrained via the medial edge of the eye into the lacrimal \ncanaliculi and on into the lacrimal sac, the lacrimal \nduct, the inferior nasal meatus and thence to the \nnose—and, if necessary, into a handkerchief. The \nconjunctiva is a mucous membrane that lines the eyelids \nand keeps them slippery on the inside.\nHistory\nPresenting symptoms include pain or discomfort and \nredness (see Table 42.2 and Questions box 42.1), loss \nor distortion of vision and watery eyes, and infection \nof the eyelids and associated structures. Loss of vision \nand other visual symptoms (see Table 42.1 and \nQuestions box 42.2) are also discussed in Chapter 32.\nAsk about symptoms of keratoconjunctivitis \nsicca (dry eyes). These include dryness, burning and \nirritation and usually become worse as the day goes \non. They are made worse by smoke, allergens and low \nhumidity (e.g. from air conditioning). The cause may be \nreduced tear production or increased tear evaporation \n(List 42.1).\nMore general questions include asking about a \nhistory of arthritis or known vasculitis, multiple sclerosis \nor thyroid disease; occupation and exposure to metal \nfragments or arc welding; use of contact lenses; previous \nhistory of vascular disease; diabetes or atrial fibrillation; \nand smoking. Conjunctivitis is a feature of measles \n(see Fig. 42.2).\nAsk about previous eye problems or surgery \nincluding laser correction surgery. Have the intraocular \npressures been measured recently?\nQUESTIONS TO ASK THE PATIENT WITH \nA PAINFUL RED EYE\n! denotes symptoms for the possible \ndiagnosis of an urgent or dangerous \nproblem.\n1.\t Do you wear contact lenses?

Stand well back \nat first, and note the following:\n1.\tPtosis (drooping of one or both upper eyelids).\n2.\tThe colour of the sclerae:\n○\t yellow, caused by deposits of bilirubin in \njaundice\n○\t blue, which may be due to osteogenesis \nimperfecta, because the thin sclerae allow the \nchoroidal pigment to show through; blue \nsclerae can also occur in families without \nosteogenesis imperfecta; blue-grey scleral \ndiscoloration occurs in patients with \nochronosis (see Fig. 42.3(a)), resulting from \nthe accumulation of homogentisic acid in \nconnective tissue in this inherited condition; \na\t From the Latin word for tear, lacrima.

Red–green \ncolour blindness affects 7% of males (X-linked recessive).\nTest the corneal reflex (see also p 523).\nPerform fundoscopy. Successful ophthalmoscopy \nrequires considerable practice. It is important that it \nbe performed in reduced ambient lighting so that \nthe patient’s pupils are at least partly dilated and you \nare not distracted. It can be easier to perform the \nexamination, especially of the fundi, through the \npatient’s spectacles. Otherwise, the patient’s refractive \nerror should be corrected by use of the appropriate \nophthalmoscope lens. The patient should be asked to \nstare at a point on the opposite wall or on the ceiling \nand to ignore the light of the ophthalmoscope. Patients \nwill often attempt to focus on the ophthalmoscope \nlight and should be asked not to do this. Cataracts \ncause opacification of the lens and may make fundoscopy \nimpossible. They are also associated with a reduced or \nabsent light reflex.\nBegin by examining the cornea. Use your right eye \nto examine the patient’s right eye, and vice versa. Turn \nthe ophthalmoscope lens to +20 and examine the cornea \nfrom about 20 centimetres away from the patient. Look \nparticularly for corneal ulceration. Turn the lens \ngradually down to 0 while moving closer to the patient. \nStructures, including the lens, the humour and the \nretina, at increasing distance into the eye will swim \ninto focus.\nExamine the retina (see Fig. 42.5, also Fig. 32.10 \non p 510 and pp 124–5). Focus on one of the retinal \narteries and follow it into the optic disc. The normal \ndisc is round and paler than the surrounding retina. \nThe margin of the disc is usually sharply outlined but \nwill appear blurred if there is papilloedema or papillitis, \nor pale if there is optic atrophy. Look at the rest of the \nretina, especially for haemorrhages and the retinal \nchanges of diabetes mellitus or hypertension.\nThere are four types of haemorrhages: streaky \nhaemorrhages near the vessels (linear or flame-shaped), \nlarge ecchymoses that obliterate the vessels, petechiae, \nwhich may be confused with microaneurysms, and \nsubhyaloid haemorrhages (large effusions of blood that \nhave a crescentic shape and well-marked borders; a \nfluid level may be seen).

The third type occurs in \ndiabetes mellitus, and the fourth is characteristic of \nsubarachnoid haemorrhage.\nThere are two main types of retinal change in \ndiabetes mellitus: non-proliferative and proliferative. \nNon-proliferative changes include: (1) two types of \nhaemorrhages occur specifically in diabetics—dot \nhaemorrhages, which occur in the inner retinal layers, \nand blot haemorrhages, which are larger and occur more \nsuperficially in the nerve fibre layer; (2) microaneurysms \n(tiny bulges in the vessel wall), which are due to vessel \nwall damage; and (3) two types of exudates—hard \nexudates, which have straight edges and are due to \nleakage of protein from damaged arteriolar walls, and \nsoft exudates (cottonwool spots), which have a fluffy \nappearance and are due to microinfarcts. Proliferative \nchanges include new vessel formation, which can lead \nto retinal detachment or vitreous haemorrhage.\nHypertensive changes can be classified from grades \n1 to 4:\nGrade 1\n‘Silver wiring’ of the arteries only \n(sclerosis of the vessel wall reduces its \ntransparency so that the central light \nstreak becomes broader and shinier)\nGrade 2\nSilver wiring of arteries plus \narteriovenous nipping or nicking \n(indentation or deflection of the veins \nwhere they are crossed by the \narteries)\nGrade 3\nGrade 2 plus haemorrhages \n(flame-shaped) and exudates (soft—\ncottonwool spots due to ischaemia, or \nhard—lipid residues from leaking \nvessels)\nGrade 4\nGrade 3 changes plus papilloedema.\nIt is important to describe the changes present rather \nthan just give a grade.\nRetinitis pigmentosa causes a scattering of black \npigment in a criss-cross pattern (Fig. 42.5a). This will \nbe missed if the periphery of the retina is not examined.\nInspect carefully for central retinal artery occlusion \n(Fig. 42.5b), where the whole fundus appears milky-\nwhite because of retinal oedema and the arteries \nbecome greatly reduced in diameter. This presents with \nsudden, painless unilateral blindness and is a medical \nemergency.\nCentral retinal vein thrombosis causes tortuous \nretinal veins and haemorrhages scattered over the whole \nretina, particularly occurring alongside the veins (‘blood \nand thunder retina’). This presents with sudden painless \nloss of vision, which is not total.\nIn retinal detachment, the retina may appear \nelevated or folded. The patient describes a ‘shade coming \ndown’, flashes of light or showers of black dots. A \ndiagnosis requires immediate referral to try to prevent \ntotal detachment and irrevocable blindness.\nWhite spots occur in choroiditis and when active \nhave a fluffy edge (e.g. in toxoplasmosis, sarcoidosis).\nFinally, ask the patient to look directly at the light. \nThis allows you to locate and inspect the macula. \nMacular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness; \ncentral vision is lost.

Remember \nthe other causes of ptosis (see Table 42.3).\nTest for a difference (decrease) in the sweating over \neach eyebrow with the back of the finger (absence of \nthis sign does not exclude the diagnosis).c\nHorner’s syndrome may be part of the lateral \nmedullary syndrome.d\nNext ask the patient to speak and note any hoarseness \nof the voice, which may be due to recurrent laryngeal \nnerve palsy from lung carcinoma or from a lower cranial \nnerve lesion.\nmacular degeneration—small deposits are seen \nunder the epithelium in the central retina. Macular \ndegeneration may occur secondary to an atrophic or \na neovascularisation process.\nPalpate the orbits for tenderness. Auscultate the \neyes with the bell of the stethoscope—the eye being \ntested is shut while the other is open and the patient \nis asked to stop breathing. Listen for a bruit that may \nbe a sign of an arteriovenous malformation or a vascular \ntumour.\nFeel for the preauricular node (adenoviral \nconjunctivitis).\nConsider the possibility that the patient may have \na glass eye. This should be suspected if visual acuity \nis zero in one eye and no pupillary reaction is apparent. \nAttempts to examine and interpret the fundus of a \nglass eye will amuse the patient but are always \nunsuccessful.\nThe causes of common eye abnormalities are \nsummarised in List 42.3.\nDiplopia\nMost cases of diplopia (about 60%) are not due to \na cranial nerve abnormality. It is important to have \nan approach to the problem that will help work out \nthe cause.\nFirst find out whether the diplopia is monocular \n(25%) or binocular. Monocular diplopia persists when \none eye is covered. It is usually due to an eye problem \nsuch as astigmatism, dislocated lens, uneven contact \nlens surface or thick spectacles and some types of \ncataract. It disappears if the patient looks through a \npin-hole. Although it is said to be due to hysteria, this \nis a very rare cause.\nIf the diplopia is binocular, consider the common \ncauses:\n1.\tCranial nerve palsy (III, IV or VI)—look for \nptosis, pupil changes (III), abnormal eye \nmovements.\n2.\tEye muscle disease (myasthenia gravis)—worse \nlater in the day, worse after prolonged upward \ngaze and associated with bilateral ptosis.\n3.\tThyroid ophthalmopathy—proptosis, lid lag, \nchemosis.\n4.\tTrauma to the orbit—history or signs of trauma.\n5.\tInternuclear ophthalmoplegia—associated \nneurological signs.\nb\t Johann Friedrich Horner (1831–86), a professor of ophthalmology at Zürich, \ndescribed this in 1869.\nc\t Enophthalmos, or retraction of the eye, which is often mentioned as a \nfeature of Horner’s syndrome, probably does not occur in humans. It may \noccur in cats. Horner’s original paper was very specific about miosis and \nptosis, but only casually mentioned that ‘the position of the eye seemed \nvery slightly inward’. Apparent enophthalmos results from a combination \nof ptosis and an elevated lower lid (upside-down ptosis).\nd\t Occlusion of any of the following vessels may result in this syndrome: \nvertebral; posterior inferior cerebellar; superior, middle or inferior lateral \nmedullary arteries.\n",

Remember, syringomyelia may \ncause a bilateral Horner’s syndrome.\nIritis\nIritis (anterior uveitis) presents with pain, photophobia \nand unilateral eye redness (see Table 42.2 and List 42.2). \nOn examination of the eye, there is classically a ciliary \nflush with dilated vessels around the iris. Hypopyon \nrefers to pus in the anterior chamber; a fluid level may \nbe seen. The pupil is usually irregular. There may also \nbe new vessel formation over the iris.\nIritis is associated with inflammatory arthropathies \nthat are linked to HLA-B27 positivity, including \nankylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease, \nreactive arthritis and Behçet’s disease with an acute \npresentation. Chronic iritis can be linked to juvenile \nrheumatoid arthritis, as well as sarcoidosis and \nsyphilis.\nKeratitis is inflammation of the cornea and may \nbe due to ulceration (often a result of herpes simplex \ninfection) or injury (e.g. from metal fragments in \ngrinders or flash burns in arc welders). Contact lens \nwearers who do not clean their lenses properly are \nalso at risk.

This begins in the peripheral visual fields \nand is painless.\nClosed-angle (narrow-angle) glaucoma is due to \na rapid pressure increase. Symptoms include severe \neye pain, halos around lights and nausea; it is an \nocular emergency. You may see a fixed mid-dilated \npupil, conjunctival hyperaemia and corneal redness; \nintraocular pressure on measurement is increased. The \ncondition occurs secondary to iris neovascularisation \n(e.g. new vessel formation in diabetes mellitus) or \nprimarily from an anomalous iris (e.g. genetic).

Pull it \ndown gently; the manoeuvre is often painful when there \nis infection of the external canal.\nOtoscope examination of the ears requires use of \nan earpiece that fits comfortably in the ear canal to \nallow inspection of the ear canal and tympanic \nmembrane (see Fig. 42.13). This examination is essential \nfor any patient presenting with an upper respiratory \ntract infection, any symptom related to the ears, \ndizziness, facial weakness or head injury.

Ask the patient \nto turn his or her head slightly to the side, then pull \nthe pinna up, out and back to straighten the ear canal \nand provide optimal vision. Stretch out the fingers of \nyour hand holding the otoscope to touch the patient’s \ncheek, to steady the instrument and to prevent sudden \nmovements of the patient’s head. When examining the \npatient’s right ear, the otoscope is preferably held in a \ndownward position with the right hand, while using \nthe left hand to pull the pinna. An alternative position \ninvolves holding the otoscope upwards, but there is a \nrisk that if the patient moves suddenly injury is more \nlikely to occur.\nLook at the external canal for any evidence of \ninflammation (e.g. redness or swelling) or discharge. \nThere should be no tenderness unless there is \ninflammation. Ear wax is usually white or yellowish, \nand translucent and shiny; it can be moist or hard and \nimpacted. It may obscure the view of the tympanic \nmembrane. Blood or cerebrospinal fluid (watery, clear \nfluid) may be seen in the canal if there is a fracture at \nthe base of the skull. In patients with herpes zoster, \nthere may be vesicles (fluid-filled blisters) on the \nposterior wall around the external auditory meatus.\nInspect the tympanic membrane (eardrum) by \nintroducing the speculum further into the canal in a \nforward but downward direction.

Cartilage divides the nose \ninto its two cavities. The nasal bones articulate with \nthe frontal bones and the maxilla. On the lateral walls \nof the nose the three pairs of nasal turbinates (superior, \nmiddle and inferior) cause turbulence as air enters the \nnose.

The posterior ethmoid \nsinus drains via the superior meatus. Drainage is assisted \nas a result of action of the ciliated epithelium. The \nmaxillary sinus drains upwards against gravity through \nits ostium into the nasal cavity. This explains the \nimportance of postural drainage for the treatment of \nbacterial sinusitis and why water drips from swimmers’ \nnoses when they bend over to dry their hair. The \nnasolacrimal duct drains into the inferior meatus. \nDrainage can be interrupted as a result of oedema (e.g. \nallergic rhinitis), mechanical obstruction (e.g. nasal \npolyps) or impaired ciliary function (Kartagener’s \nsyndrome).\nThe turbinates are vascular structures and their \nblood supply is under autonomic control. Sympathetic \nstimulation causes vasoconstriction and shrinkage of \nthe turbinates. Parasympathetic stimulation causes \nvasodilation, swelling and sometimes obstruction of \nairflow and a watery discharge. The blood supply to \nthe nose is from the internal and external carotid \narteries. The blood vessels of the anterior nasal septum \nmeet at Little’si area. This is about 2 centimetres from \nthe nares (nostrils). Nose bleeds often come from this \nvascular area.\nThe nerve supply of the nose includes the olfactory \nnerve, which supplies the olfactory epithelium in the \nupper part of the nose. Fibres of the olfactory nerve \npass through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone \nto reach the olfactory bulb in the brain. The rest of the \ninside of the nose is supplied by branches of the \ntrigeminal nerve.\nThe vascular nasal mucosa produces mucus, which \ncontains immunoglobulins.

Pain \nand tenderness over the sinuses occurs, which in adults \nis classified as acute if less than 4 weeks in duration, \nsubacute if 4–12 weeks in duration and chronic if greater \nthan 12 weeks in duration. Most acute sinusitis is \nsecondary to viral infection.4\nAcute bacterial sinusitis (see Fig. 42.19) can occur \nafter viral infection or in the setting of allergic rhinitis, \nin patients with anatomical abnormalities such as \nnasal septal deformity or polyps in the nose, or in \nimmunocompromised patients. The most common \nExamination method\nNose and sinus examination consists of inspection, \npalpation and testing the sense of smell. Inspect the \nskin. The patient concerned about a big nose may have \na rhinophyma.j This enlargement and distortion of the \nskin of the nose is due to sebaceous gland enlargement. \nIt is often associated with rosacea. Note any nasal \ndeviation (best seen from behind the patient and looking \ndown). Note any periorbital swelling (e.g. from \nsinusitis). Inspect the nares by pressing the tip of the \nnose upwards with the thumb.\nPalpate the nasal bones. Then feel for facial swelling \nor signs of inflammation. Block each nostril to assess \nany obstruction by asking the patient to inhale. If there \nis a history of anosmia (loss of smell), test smell as \ndescribed in Chapter 32 (cranial nerve I).\nA saddle-nose deformity (collapse of the nasal \nseptum) can occur in granulomatosis with polyangiitis \n(GPA) and relapsing polychondritis.\nExamine inside the nose using a nasal speculum. \nThis simple device with two blades can be used to open \nthe nares. Hold the device in your left hand and \nintroduce it into the patient’s nose with the blades facing \nup and down. The blades should not rest or be pushed \nagainst the nasal septum.

Its \nfunctions include eating and speech and it is the \nmain area where taste is detected. It has a central \nsagittal median sulcus that ends posteriorly at \nthe foramen caecum. The surface is rough \nbecause of its covering of papillae. The fungiform \npapillae are found on the tip and sides of the \ntongue. The largest papillae lie in front of the \ncaecum and are called the circumvallate papillae. \nThey divide the tongue into the posterior \none-third and the anterior two-thirds.\n•\t The teeth.\n•\t The hard palate is a concave bony structure. \nAnteriorly its mucosa has raised folds called \nrugae. The soft palate is muscular and flexible. \nIt ends at the uvula, which helps close off the \nnasopharynx during swallowing.\n•\t The taste buds are found on the sides of the \npapillae. The chorda tympani, which is a division \nof the facial nerve, receives taste input from the \nanterior two-thirds of the tongue and the \nglossopharyngeal nerve from the posterior \none-third. Salty taste is detected at the sides of \nthe tongue, sweet taste at the tip of the tongue \nbacterial causes of sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae \nand Haemophilus influenzae. The four key clinical \nfeatures suggesting that sinusitis may be bacterial are: \n(1) worsening symptoms after early improvement (a \nbiphasic illness pattern), (2) purulent discharge from \nthe nose, (3) tooth or facial pain over the maxillary \nsinus (especially if unilateral), and (4) tenderness over \nthe maxillary sinus (unilaterally). Fever may occur.\nComplications of acute bacterial sinusitis can include \norbital cellulitis, meningitis, cavernous sinus thrombosis, \nbrain abscess and osteolitis of the sinus bones. Therefore, \nif patients present with any of the following warning \nsigns—periorbital oedema, visual changes or changes \nin mental status—you should be concerned about \ncomplicated bacterial sinusitis. Orbital cellulitis typically \npresents with erythema of the eyelid, oedema of the \neyelid and proptosis. Periorbital cellulitis is a more \nbenign condition caused by primary infection of the \nskin around the orbit.\nPotential mimickers of acute bacterial sinusitis \ninclude GPA, carcinoma or lymphoma, sarcoidosis and, \nin immunocompromised or diabetic patients, fungal \nsinusitis. Chronic sinusitis presents with chronic sinus \ncongestion, postnasal drip, cough, headache and bad \nbreath.\nRhinocerebral mucormycosis is a fungal infection \nthat destroys the sinuses. A black eschar may be seen \non the nasal mucosa or palate.\nExamination\nThere are two commonly used ways of illuminating \nthe sinuses. The simpler method is to place a bright \ntorch or proprietary transilluminoscope in the patient’s \nmouth. The room must be completely dark and the \npatient must seal the lips around the device. Normal \nsinuses are visible through the skin of the face and \nappear as a warm glow. This method has the advantage \nthat the two sides can be compared. The second method \navoids the need to clean the torch between examinations. \nPlace the torch over the infraorbital rim and shield \nyour eyes from the light while peering into the patient’s \nmouth to look for illumination of the hard palate.\nMOUTH AND THROAT\nExamination anatomy\nThe main structures of the oral cavity (see Fig. 42.20) \nare as follows:\nPalatoglossal \narch\nLateral \nincisor\nCentral \nincisor\nSoft palate\nCanine\nUvula\nPosterior wall\nof pharynx\nPalato-\npharyngeal \narch\nPalatine \ntonsil\nMedian sulcus\nFirst premolar\nSecond\npremolar\nFirst molar\nSecond molar\nThird molar\nThe mouth and throat \nFIGURE 42.20 \n",

Elongation and \npigmentation (from food or tobacco staining or certain \nmicroorganisms) of the papillae makes the tongue look \nblack and hairy. This is also benign. A tongue with \nexaggerated fissures is called a scrotal tongue; it is also \nbenign. Look for evidence of Candida infection (see Fig. \n42.22). These white lesions cover an inflamed mucosa \nand may be the result of immunodeficiency or recent \nantibiotic use.\nInspect the floor of the mouth and under the tongue. \nAsk the patient to lift the tongue up onto the hard \npalate to give you a good view. Large veins may be \nvisible under the tongue in elderly people. These are \nbenign and are not a cause of bleeding. Inspect the \nmucosal surfaces for the abnormalities described above. \nThere may also be a ranula.k This is a large mucus \nretention cyst. These can be quite large and although \npainless eventually interfere with eating and speech.\nInspect the hard and soft palates for similar mucosal \nlesions and the hard palate for petechiae. A common \nbenign finding is a bony swelling of the posterior part \nof the hard palate. This occurs in the midline and is \noften lobulated. It is called a torus palatinus.l\nPalpate the tongue with your gloved hand. Hold it \nwith some gauze with one hand and feel with the other. \nThe anterior two-thirds can usually be palpated without \nprovoking the gag reflex. Feel for induration (hardening) \nof any lesion (a sign of malignancy).\nNow palpate the floor of the mouth. Using both \ngloved hands, feel with your right index finger pointing \ndownwards under the tongue and your left index finger \nunder the chin and pushing upwards. Use the thumb \nand third finger of your left hand to push the patient’s \ncheeks in between the teeth; this is a precaution \nthat prevents your finger being bitten. Feel between \nyour fingers for masses and tenderness. Feel the \nsubmandibular salivary glands.\nAsk the patient to say ‘Ah’, then inspect the \noropharynx and uvula (there is often a need to press \na tongue depressor on the tongue to see properly—and \nusing two tongue depressors can help even further). \nThe tongue should be pushed forwards behind the front \nteeth. Applying the depressor too far back will cause \ncaused by traumatic damage or obstruction of a small \nsalivary gland.\nLook at the buccal mucosa, palate and teeth. Using \na light, push the buccal mucosa out of the way with a \ntongue depressor. Note any signs of inflammation (e.g. \nredness, swelling). Look at the parotid duct opening \n(for inflammation). White painless plaques (leucoplakia) \nmay be present on the gingivae, tongue or buccal \nmucosa. This is a precancerous condition. Lichen planus \nalso causes a white painless lesion in the mouth. It has \na reticulated pattern. Look for masses and ulcerated \nlesions. Inspect the teeth for obvious decay and \ninfection.\nLook at the gingivae for hypertrophy (associated \nwith phenytoin use, leukaemia and pregnancy), bleed­\ning and inflammation. Erythroplakia is a mucosal \nabnormality characterised by red granular papules that \nbleed easily. It has more malignant potential than \nleucoplakia.\nInspect the tongue first in the mouth, then ask \nthe patient to poke it out to one side and then the \nother.

J A LINDSAY\nEXAMINATION ANATOMY\nFig. 43.1 shows the three main layers of the skin: the \nepidermis, dermis and subcutaneous fat. These layers \ncan all be involved in skin diseases in varying \ncombinations. For example, most skin tumours arise \nin the epidermis (see Fig. 43.2), some bullous eruptions \noccur at the dermoepidermal junction (DEJ), and \nlipomas are tumours of subcutaneous fat. The skin \nappendages, which include the sweat (eccrine and \napocrine) glands, hair follicles (see Fig. 43.3) and the \nnails, are common sites of infection.\nThe eccrine glands are present everywhere except \nin the nail beds and on some mucosal surfaces. They \nare able to secrete over 5 litres of sweat per day. The \napocrine glands are found in association with hair \nfollicles but are confined to certain areas of the body, \nincluding the axillae, the pubis, the perineum and the \nnipples. They secrete a viscous fluid whose function is \nunclear in humans.\nThe nails are formed from heavily keratinised cells \nthat grow from the nail matrix. The matrix grows in \na semilunar shape and appears as the lunules in normal \nfinger- and toenails.

Paronychia is an infection of \nthe skin surrounding the nails. Other changes to \nnote include pitting (psoriasis, fungal infections) \nand onycholysis (e.g. thyrotoxicosis, psoriasis). \nDark staining under the nail may indicate a \nsubungual melanoma. Linear splinter \nhaemorrhages (e.g. vasculitis) or telangiectasias \n(e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus) may be seen \nin the nail bed.\nA purplish discoloration in streaks over the \nknuckles may indicate dermatomyositis (Gottron’s \npapules). Also look at the backs of the hands  \nand forearms for the characteristic blisters of \nporphyria, which occur on the exposed skin. \nPapules and scratch marks on the backs of the \nhands, between the fingers and around the wrists \nmay indicate scabies. Viral warts are common on \nthe hands.\nLook at the palms for Dupuytren’s contracture, \npigmented flat junctional moles (which have a \nhigh risk of becoming malignant) and \nxanthomata in the palmar creases.\nNext look at the forearms, where lichen planus \nmay occur on the flexor surfaces (characterised \nby small shiny, violaceous flat-topped polygonal \npapules) and psoriasis may be present on the \nextensor surfaces. Palpable purpura—raised \nbruising that indicates bleeding into the skin—\nmay be seen on the arms and indicates vasculitis. \nAcanthosis nigricans can occur in the axillae.\nInspect the patient’s hair and scalp. Decide \nwhether or not the hair is dry and whether the \ndistribution is normal. Alopecia may indicate male \npattern baldness, recent severe illness, \nhypothyroidism or thyrotoxicosis. Patches of \nalopecia occur in the disease alopecia areata. \nShort broken-off hairs occur typically in systemic \nlupus erythematosus. In psoriasis there are silvery \nscales, which may be seen on the skin of the \nscalp. Metastatic deposits may rarely be felt as \nfirm nodules within the skin of the scalp. \nSebaceous cysts are common. The unfortunate \nexaminer may find nits sticking to the head hairs.\nMove down now to the eyebrows and look for \nscaling and greasiness, which are found in \nseborrhoeic dermatitis. A purplish erythema \noccurs around the eyelids in dermatomyositis \n(heliotrope rash). Xanthelasmata are seen near \nthe eyelid.\nLook at the face for rosacea, which causes \nbright erythema of the nose, cheeks, forehead \nand chin, and occasionally pustules and \nrhinophyma (disfiguring swelling of the nose). \nAcne causes papules, pustules and comedones \ninvolving the face, neck and upper trunk. The \nbutterfly rash of systemic lupus erythematosus \noccurs across the cheeks but is rare. Spider naevi \nmay be present. Ulcerating lesions on the face \nmay include basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell \ncarcinoma or, rarely, tuberculosis (lupus vulgaris).\nOther tumours of the face include \nkeratoacanthoma (a volcano-like lesion  \nfrom a sebaceous gland) and congenital \nhaemangiomas.\nLook for the blisters of herpes zoster, which may \noccur strictly in the distribution of one of the \ndivisions of the trigeminal nerve.\nInspect the neck, which is prone to many of \nthe lesions that occur on the face. Rarely, the \nredundant loose skin of pseudoxanthoma \nelasticum will be seen around the neck.\nGo on to inspect the trunk, where any of the \nchildhood exanthema produce their \ncharacteristic rashes. Look for spider naevi. \nCampbell de Morgan spots are commonly found \non the abdomen (and chest), as are flat, greasy, \nyellow-coloured seborrhoeic keratosis. They may \nalso be pigmented (brown or black) or skin-\ncoloured. Erythema marginatum (rheumatic \nfever) occurs on the chest and abdomen. Herpes \nzoster may be seen overlying any of the \ndermatome distributions.\nTEXT BOX 43.1 \nwill be placed on cutaneous signs as indications of \nsystemic disease.

The genitals are \nnot routinely inspected unless directed by the patient \nor a specific pathology is being investigated.\nWhen examining actual skin lesions, a number of \nfeatures should be documented. First, the morphology \nof each lesion should be described precisely. Use the \nappropriate dermatological terminology (see Table \n43.2), even though this may seem to make dermatological \ndiseases more, rather than less, mysterious. As many \ndermatological diagnoses are purely descriptive, a good \ndescription will often be of considerable help in making \nthe diagnosis. Second, the distribution of the lesions \nshould be noted, as certain distributions suggest specific \ndiagnoses. Third, the pattern of the lesions—such as \nThe dermatological examination: a suggested method continued\nMetastases from internal malignancies may \nrarely occur anywhere on the skin. Neurofibromas \nare soft flesh-coloured tumours; when associated \nwith more than five ‘café-au-lait’ spots (brownish, \nirregular lesions) they suggest neurofibromatosis. \nPigmented moles are seen on the trunk and these \nshould be assessed for signs of melanoma. The \npatient’s buttocks and sacrum must be examined \nfor bedsores, and the abdomen and thighs may \nhave areas of fat atrophy or hypertrophy from \ninsulin injections.\nGo to the legs, where erythema nodosum or \nerythema multiforme may be seen on the shins. \nNecrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum affects the skin \nover the tibia in diabetics. Pretibial myxoedema \nalso occurs over the shins. Look for ulcers on \neither side of the lower part of the leg. Livedo \nreticularis is a net-like, red reticular rash that \noccurs in vasculitis, the antiphospholipid \nsyndrome and with atheroembolism.\nInspect the feet for the characteristic lesion  \nof reactive arthritis called keratoderma \nblennorrhagicum, where crusted lesions spread \nacross the sole because of the fusion of vesicles \nand pustules. Look at the foot for signs of \nischaemia, associated with wasting of the skin \nand skin appendages. Trophic ulcers may be \nseen in patients with peripheral neuropathy (e.g. \ndiabetes mellitus).

It is always important to keep in mind whether \nthe skin changes are primary (i.e. caused by the disease \nitself) or secondary (i.e. caused by the patient—like \nexcoriations [scratch marks]—or by the lesion’s \nevolution—e.g. erosion or ulceration, crusting, eschar, \nfissuring or lichenification).

Next, evaluate in what tissue \nlayer the lump is situated.

After performing surgery, readers were warned to look out \nfor the four cardinal signs of postsurgical inflammation—‘calor, rubor, \ndolor and tumor’.

They look hard \nbut are remarkably soft; they occur in neurofibromatosis \ntype 1 (von Recklinghausen’sb disease).

With each major sign \nthe groups of common important diseases that should \nbe considered will be listed.\nPruritus\nPruritus simply means itching, and is the most \ncommonly reported skin symptom. It may be either \ngeneralised or localised. Scratch marks are generally \npresent. Localised pruritus is usually caused by a \ndermatological condition such as dermatitis or eczema. \nGeneralised pruritus may be caused by primary skin \ndisease, systemic disease or psychogenic factors.\nTo determine the cause of the pruritus it is essential \nto examine the skin in detail (see List 43.2). Excoriations \nare caused by scratching, regardless of the underlying \ncause. Specific features of cutaneous diseases such as \ndermatitis, urticaria, scabies (see Fig. 43.10) or the \nblisters of dermatitis herpetiformis and bullous \npemphigoid should be looked for.\nWhen primary skin diseases have been excluded, \na detailed history and examination should be undertaken \n",

Nodular vasculitis is another type \nof panniculitis causing painful nodules on the lower \nlegs, usually on the calves. In contrast the lesions of \nerythema nodosum are usually found in the pretibial \narea and are erythematous, palpable and tender \n(p 278). Systemic symptoms may include fever, \narthralgia, arthritis and malaise. A significant \npercentage of cases—more than one-third—are \nidiopathic; other common causes include upper \nrespiratory tract infections (both streptococcal \nand viral), drugs such as the oral contraceptive \nand sulfonamides, inflammatory bowel disease, \ntuberculosis and sarcoidosis (see List 43.9).\nErythema multiforme (EM)\nThis is a distinctive inflammatory reaction of skin and \nmucosa. The characteristic skin lesion is a target lesion \nthat has a well-defined border and consists of three \ndistinct zones of colour change (see Fig. 43.24). The \ncentre develops a dusky appearance over time and has \nbeen likened to a ‘bulls eye’. The central zone can form \na bulla or crust. When the mucosal membranes are \nsignificantly involved the condition is referred to as \nEM major; in the purely cutaneous form it is called \nEM minor. In most cases the condition is precipitated \nby viral infections, especially clinical or subclinical \nherpes simplex virus. Other causes include Mycoplasma \nNeutrophilic dermatoses are a group of conditions \ncharacterised by neutrophilic infiltrates without any \nidentifiable infectious cause. Sweet’s syndromed (acute \nfebrile neutrophilic dermatosis) is a condition involving \npainful red plaques and nodules that are well demarcated \nfrom surrounding skin. There is often an associated \nfever. Sweet’s syndrome may be idiopathic or occur in \nassociation with haematological disease (myelodysplastic \ndisorders and acute myeloid leukaemia), solid organ \ntumours, infections, inflammatory bowel disease, \nautoimmune disease, pregnancy and some drugs (e.g. \ngranulocyte-stimulating factor).\nThere are a number of other neutrophilic dermatoses \nincluding pyoderma gangrenosum and Behçet’s disease.\nLupus pernio (see Fig. 43.23) appears as violaceous \npapules and plaques on the nose, cheeks and ears. \nDespite its name this condition is not associated with \nsystemic lupus erythematosus: it is a manifestation of \ncutaneous sarcoidosis.

If there is severe pain, the skin \nis pale pink rather than floridly erythematous and the \npatient has signs of sepsis, consider necrotising fasciitis.\nFolliculitis, furuncles and \ncarbuncles\nThese conditions are all infections of hair follicles of \nvarying severity.\nFolliculitis is a very common disorder characterised \nby superficial inflammation of a hair follicle. Most cases \nare due to staphylococcal infection but they can be \ncaused by other microorganisms (such as Candida, \nMalassezia or Pseudomonas) or topical medications, \nor be drug induced. If the infection becomes deeper, \nit becomes a furuncle (or boil) and if it spreads to involve \na number of adjacent hair follicles it becomes a \ncarbuncle. Lesions can occur anywhere on the skin but \nare commoner on the buttocks, neck and anogenital \narea. They are very painful and often associated with \nsystemic symptoms. Staphylococcal organisms are \nusually responsible. The deep lesions heal by rupturing \nand exuding pus. They often leave a scar. Draining \nlymph nodes may be enlarged and tender.\nThe condition hidradenitis suppurativa, which \nespecially affects obese young women, is associated \nwith lesions similar to furuncles. The condition involves \nthe apocrine glands in the axillae, the groin and the \nsubmammary areas and exhibits the pathognomonic \ndouble-ended comedone.\nOther infections\nViral infections can lead to skin reactions. Measles is an \nexample of an infection causing a viral exanthem (see Fig. \n43.27). Many viruses including cytomegalovirus (CMV), \nEpstein–Barr virus (EBV), Coxsackie virus and the \nseroconversion illness after human immunodeficiency \nvirus (HIV) infection can cause a similar rash. Patients \nwith EBV infection treated with amoxicillin develop \na characteristic rash (see Fig. 43.28). Meningococcal \nsepticaemia causes a petechial rash, which can progress \nto purpura fulminans (see Fig. 43.29).\nImpetigo is the most common cutaneous bacterial \ninfection, characterised by honey-coloured golden \ncrusting, vesicles and pustules on an erythematous \nbase.

This \npattern is called postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. \nHypopigmentation (decreased pigment) may also occur \nafter inflammation, or with pityriasis versicolor where \nMalassezia yeast creates azaleic acid, which destroys \nmelanin.

This infection is more \ncommon in people with diabetes, peripheral vascular \ndisease and immunosuppression. The characteristic \nfindings are thickened yellow nails, ridging, crumbling \nand deformity. The changes can be difficult to distinguish \nfrom psoriasis.

Acute \nparonychia is usually caused by S. aureus infection; \nother causes include ingrown nails, irritants, trauma \n(for example, from biting nails or sucking the thumb) \nor manicures. Chronic paronychia affects a number of \nfingers and causes red, swollen nail folds that have no \ncuticles. It leads to chronic ridging and dystrophy \nof the nail plate.

In patients \nwith dermatomyositis, nailfold telangiectasiae are \nassociated with hypertrophy of the cuticle and small \nhaemorrhagic infarcts.

SHAKESPEARE, Henry V\nOlder patients make up an increasing proportion of \npeople admitted to hospital, their length of stay is often \nlong and they need special consideration because of \ntheir often varied and complicated multiple medical \nproblems.1\nThere is lack of universal agreement on what \nconstitutes the age cut-off that defines a geriatric patient. \nOnly 140 years ago, old age was set above 50. Today \nin the Western world as people (and their doctors) \nage, the cut-off may be extended above 65a (what highly \ncompetent older doctor in practice would want to be \nclassified as geriatric?). Arbitrary distinctions currently \ndrawn between the young old (65–74), the middle old \n(75–84) and the oldest old (85+) do not necessarily \nreflect biological age. The number of oldest old is \ngrowing steadily; this change will increasingly challenge \nhealth systems and has major resource implications \nfor the future.\nGeriatric patients tend to report fewer symptoms \nbut have more chronic diseases. Hence, disease \npresentation is more likely to be atypical, so spending \ntime taking the history is critical. Emphasis must be \nplaced on the big four matters of concern for older \npeople:\n•\t immobility\n•\t instability\n•\t impaired intellect or memory\n•\t incontinence.\nThese can be assessed as part of an activities of daily \nliving (ADL) index (see Lists 44.4 and 44.5).2,3\nAny of these may be caused or worsened by \npolypharmacy, which is a very common problem in \nelderly patients.\nYou need to find out about the risk of falls, mobility \nproblems, ability to cope and risks to safety among \nother problems (see List 44.1 and Questions box 44.1). \nFunctional and cognitive impairment are very important \nhealth problems to identify in older patients. Hearing \nand visual impairment, as well as cognitive decline, \ncan impair history taking (see List 44.2).\nHISTORY TAKING IN OLDER \nPERSONS: SPECIAL \nCONSIDERATIONS\n1.\tPresenting complaint: a single complaint is \nunusual.\n2.\tPast history: record the patient’s immunisation \nstatus, especially for Pneumococcus, influenza \nand tetanus.\na  Ask any relatives who are over 65 whether they think that they are old: \n70 is the new 50!\nTHE COMPREHENSIVE GERIATRIC \nASSESSMENT:1 ASSESSMENT  \nCOMPONENTS (THE ABCs)\n1.\t Activities of daily living\n2.\t Balance, frailty testing\n3.\t Cognition\n4.\t Depression, drugs (polypharmacy), dentition \n(including nutrition and weight change)\n5.\t Environment: home situation, social support, \nfinancial issues, living will (advance care \nplanning)\n6.\t Falls risk (history of falls, ‘get up and go’ test, \nfunctional reach test)\n7.\t Gait speed (faster walkers have better survival)\n8.\t Hearing, vision\n9.\t Incontinence (urine, stool), sexual function\nLIST 44.1 \n",

In studies of fever of unknown \norigin,3 infection is found to be the cause in 30%, \nneoplasia in 30%, connective tissue disease in 15% and \nmiscellaneous causes in 15%; in 10% the aetiology \nremains unknown (see List 45.1).

The majority of patients do not \nhave a rare disease but rather a relatively common \ndisease presenting in an unusual way.4\nHistory\nThe history may give a number of clues in these puzzling \ncases. In some patients a careful history may give the \ndiagnosis where expensive tests have failed. (See \nQuestions box 45.1.)\nThe time course of the fever and any associated \nsymptoms must be uncovered. Symptoms from the \nvarious body systems should be sought methodically. \nExamples include:\n1.\tgastrointestinal system—diarrhoea, abdominal \npain, recent abdominal surgery (inflammatory \nbowel disease, diverticular disease, cholangitis)\n2.\tcardiovascular system—heart murmurs, dental \nprocedures (infective endocarditis), chest pain \n(pericarditis)\n3.\trheumatology—joint symptoms, rashes, persistent \nback pain (spondylodiscitis may cause PUO and \nprogress to quadriplegia)\n4.\tneurology—headache (meningitis, cerebral \nabscess)\n5.\tgenitourinary system—history of renal disease or \ninfection, dysuria\n6.\trespiratory system—old tuberculosis (TB) or \nrecent TB contact, chest symptoms.\nDetails of any recent overseas travel are important. \nFind out also about hobbies and exposure to pets. \nOccupational exposure may be important. Take a drug \nhistory. Find out whether the patient is involved in \nbehaviour posing a risk of HIV infection. Patients who \nare already in hospital may have infected cannulas or \nold cannula sites. The new onset of fever in a hospitalised \npatient is an indication to remove a peripheral cannula \n(send the tip for culture).\nFever due to bacteraemia (the presence of viable \nbacteria in the bloodstream) is associated with a higher \nrisk of mortality. Bacteraemia is present in up to 20% \nof hospital patients with acute fever.5,6\nExamination\nGeneral\nLook at the temperature chart to see whether there is \na pattern of fever that is identifiable. Inspect the patient \nand decide how seriously ill he or she appears. Look \nfor evidence of weight loss (indicating a chronic illness). \nNote any skin rash (see List 45.2).

Inspect for rashes, including \nrose-coloured spots (in typhoid fever—2- to 4-millimetre \nflat red spots, which blanch on pressure and occur on \nthe upper abdomen and lower chest). Examine for \nevidence of hepatomegaly and ascites (e.g. spontaneous \nbacterial peritonitis, hepatic carcinoma, metastatic \ndeposits), splenomegaly (e.g. haemopoietic malignancy, \ninfective endocarditis, malaria), renal enlargement (e.g. \nrenal cell carcinoma) or localised tenderness (e.g. \ncollection of pus). Palpate for testicular enlargement \n(e.g. seminoma, tuberculosis). Feel for inguinal \nlymphadenopathy.\nPerform a rectal examination, feeling for a mass or \ntenderness in the rectum or pelvis (e.g. abscess, \ncarcinoma, prostatitis). Perform a vaginal examination \nto detect collections of pelvic pus or evidence of pelvic \ninflammatory disease. Look at the penis and scrotum \nfor a discharge or rash.\nCentral nervous system\nExamine the central nervous system for signs of \nmeningism (e.g. chronic tuberculous meningitis, \ncryptococcal meningitis) or focal neurological signs (e.g. \nbrain abscess, mononeuritis multiplex in polyarteritis \nnodosa).\nClinical scenarios for \nunexplained fever\nConsider age, co-morbidities and the epidemiology, \ne.g. adult with a prosthetic heart valve (endocarditis), \nyoung female with a rash (systemic lupus), post \nneurosurgery on phenytoin (drug), middle-aged with \neasy bruising and fatigue (haematological malignancy), \nyoung migrant from Nepal (TB).\nHIV INFECTION AND AIDS\nThe acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), \nfirst described in 1981, is caused by the human \nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV).7–9 This is a T-cell \nlymphotrophic virus, which results in T4-cell destruction \nand therefore susceptibility to opportunistic infections \nand the development of tumours, notably Kaposi’sa \nsarcoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.\nHands\nLook for the stigmata of infective endocarditis or \nvasculitic changes. Note whether there is clubbing. The \npresence of arthropathy or Raynaud’s phenomenon \nmay point to a connective tissue disease.\nArms\nInspect for drug injection sites suggesting intravenous \ndrug abuse (see Fig. 7.2 on p 123) as well as recent \ncannula sites. Peripheral cannulae are responsible for \nsepsis and death in hospitalised patients. The new onset \nof fever in a hospitalised patient is an indication to \nremove the peripheral cannula (send the tip for culture). \nFeel for the epitrochlear and axillary nodes (e.g. \nlymphoma, other malignancy, sarcoidosis, focal \ninfections).\nHead and neck\nFeel the temporal arteries (over the temples for giant \ncell arteritis). In temporal arteritis these may be tender \nand thickened.\nExamine the eyes for iritis or conjunctivitis (e.g. \nleptospirosis, measles, connective tissue disease e.g. \nreactive arthritis) or jaundice (e.g. ascending cholangitis, \nblackwater fever in malaria). Look in the fundi for \nchoroidal tubercles in miliary tuberculosis, Roth’s spots \nin infective endocarditis and retinal haemorrhages or \nthe infiltrates of leukaemia or lymphoma.\nInspect the face for a butterfly rash (systemic lupus \nerythematosus, see Fig. 25.11 on p 416) or seborrhoeic \ndermatitis, which is common in patients with HIV \ninfection.\nExamine the mouth for ulcers, gum disease or \ncandidiasis, and the teeth and tonsils for infection (e.g. \nabscess). Look in the ears for otitis media. Feel the \nparotid glands for evidence of infection.\nPalpate the cervical lymph nodes. Examine for \nthyroid enlargement and tenderness (subacute \nthyroiditis).\nChest\nExamine the chest. Palpate for bony tenderness. \nCarefully examine the respiratory system (e.g. for signs \nof pneumonia, tuberculosis, empyema, carcinoma) and \nthe heart for murmurs (e.g. infective endocarditis, atrial \nmyxoma) or rubs (e.g. pericarditis).\na  Moritz Kohn Kaposi (1837–1902), a professor of dermatology in Vienna, \ndescribed the sarcoma in 1892.\n",

Ask about: fever, \nlymphadenopathy, maculopapular rash, arthralgia, \npharyngitis, nausea and vomiting, headache, weight \nloss and oral candidiasis.\nCareful questioning (see Questions box 45.2) about \nthe mode of infection is important but should be left \nto a subsequent consultation if the patient seems \nreluctant to discuss this. Patients may be unwilling to \ninform their sexual partners that they are infected. \nThis puts the latter at risk of infection and there is a \nduty on the treating clinician’s part to ensure that these \npeople are informed, tested and protected (e.g. by \ncondom use).\nHIV infection is often present in combination with \nother sexually transmitted infections, such as syphilis \nand gonorrhoea, and with the hepatic viruses B and \nC.

      "text": "CHAPTER 46 \nThe psychiatric history and mental \nstate examination\nLaw number four: the patient is the one with the disease.  SAMUEL SHEM, The House of God\nThis chapter deals with the psychiatric history and the \nmental state examination. The practising clinician must \nhave an understanding of psychiatric illness and know \nhow to perform a psychiatric interview and a mental \nstate examination. This is because there is considerable \noverlap between psychiatric and physical illness.\nPsychiatric disorders (especially anxiety and \ndepression) are common (one person in four will \nexperience a mental illness in his or her lifetime) but \nmost will fully recover. People suffering from these \nconditions often have medical problems or problems \nwith drugs and alcohol. Appropriate management \nof these patients requires an understanding of the \nintercurrent psychiatric disorder and the effect of that \ndisorder on the primary medical problem. A medical \nillness may, in some instances, present as a psychiatric \nillness. For example, some endocrine disorders, such \nas hypothroidism, may present with depression. \nOn the other hand, some psychiatric disorders may \npresent medically. Panic disorder (or acute anxiety) \nmay be mistaken for an acute myocardial infarction. \nFurthermore, a patient’s psychological state may interfere \nwith the course of a medical illness; it may lead in some \ncases to exaggeration of the symptoms and in others to \ndenial of the severity of physical symptoms. Medical \nillnesses, particularly chronic and / or life-threatening \nillnesses, have major psychological impacts and can be \ncomplicated by psychiatric symptoms (such as anxiety \nor depression) that can induce disability and affect \nrecovery from illness.\nTHE HISTORY\nThe psychiatric history generally follows the same \nformat as the standard medical history, and the \nprinciples described apply just as much here as in any \nhistory taking.1 One should enquire about the history \nof the present illness, the past psychiatric and medical \nhistory, and the family and social history. However, \nthe psychiatric history aims to elicit more detail about \nthe patient’s illness from a broad perspective, focusing \nnot only on symptoms but also on the patient’s social \nbackground, psychological functioning and life \ncircumstances (a biopsychosocial approach). Within \nthe psychiatric history, particular attention is paid to \nthe developmental, personal and social history, although \nthese factors are usually also relevant in the general \nmedical history.\nEvery medical interview should aim to be \ntherapeutic as well as diagnostic. The method of \npsychiatric history taking is somewhat different \nfrom the standard medical interview. In the course \nof the interview it is hoped that the patient will be \nable to talk about his or her concerns  in detail, and \ntheir context. In doing so, patients should gain some \nrelief from their distress by airing their problems. \nFor this to take place, the clinician’s attitude needs \nto be unhurried, patient and understanding. The \npsychiatric history also aims to gain an understanding \nof how the patient’s problem arose from a biological, \ninterpersonal, social and psychological perspective, \nso that the best management plan can be worked \nout. In this way, the psychiatric interview is similar \nto the general medical interview. These factors are \nalso important in relation to any illness, especially if \nit is a chronic or life-threatening problem. Psychiatric \nand physical problems often coexist and each affects \nthe other. A comprehensive medical interview should \ntherefore encompass both physical and psychological \nconcerns.\n",

      "text": "846\t\nSECTION 13  Mental health history and examination\nOBTAINING THE HISTORY\nThe clinician taking a psychiatric history wants the \npatient to tell his or her story in his or her own words. \nIn this way the patient will be more likely to report the \nmost important aspects of the illness. Of course, this \ntechnique also applies to the general medical interview. \nIt is best achieved using a non-directive approach with \nopen-ended questions. Open-ended questions are those \nto which the patient responds with a narrative (or a \ndescription about what has been happening) rather \nthan a simple factual response. They give patients an \nopportunity to talk about their problems in their own \nwords. Closed questions, on the other hand, are more \nlikely to elicit ‘yes’ or ‘no’ responses. For example, in \nthe assessment of a patient with depression, a closed \nquestion would be: ‘Have you been depressed?’ An \nopen-ended question would be: ‘Tell me about how \nyou have been feeling.’ At first glance it might appear \nthat the open-ended question is less efficient, as it could \ntake longer to find out about a range of symptoms. \nHowever, with a careful and judicious approach, \nopen-ended questioning—by permitting the patient \nto tell the story—will enable the clinician to get a \ncomprehensive history efficiently. This is not to say that \ntargeted, more-closed questions must not be used—they \nare necessary to elicit information on certain symptoms.\nIt takes experience and practice to feel confident \nand unembarrassed when interviewing patients who \nhave difficult psychiatric problems that may be \nassociated with a certain stigma or where the questioning \nis about sexual or intimate problems. This is certainly \nnot the place to make judgements about or appear \nshocked by what a patient is saying. Of course, appearing \nto be sympathetic about the patient’s difficulties is \nnecessary here, as it is with any medical interview.\nWhile the patient is telling his or her story, you \nshould begin to formulate hypotheses about the problem \nor diagnosis. These hypotheses are tested by asking \nmore-focused questions later in the interview, at which \npoint a diagnostic hypothesis can be rejected or pursued \nfurther. For example, a patient may describe tiredness \nand lethargy, an inability to concentrate and loss of \nappetite. These symptoms will suggest a diagnosis of \ndepression. Follow-up questions should focus on this \npossibility. You should ask questions about other \nsymptoms of depression such as: ‘How have you been \nfeeling in yourself?’, ‘What has your mood been like?’ \nand ‘How have you been sleeping?’\nIntroductory questions\nThe assessment of psychiatric symptoms should start \nwith non-threatening questions. After introducing \nyourself, it can be useful to begin by asking about \nbasic demographic information (age, marital status, \noccupation, whom the patient lives with) and then \nmake the patient feel at ease by discussing some neutral \ntopic. In some cases the presenting problem will be an \nobvious psychiatric or psychological one. For example, \na patient may say, ‘I’ve come to see you because I’ve \nbeen feeling very depressed’. However, even such an \napparently definite psychiatric problem may have a \nmedical cause, such as hypothyroidism or a recent \nserious medical illness. More often, the presenting \nproblem will be a more general one, such as ‘I have \nno energy and feel tired all the time’. This may be \ndue to a depressive illness or it could have a medical \ncause such as anaemia. Remember that psychiatric \nand medical problems are intimately entwined. It is \nrare for an interview to focus purely on psychiatric \nproblems.\nHistory of the presenting illness\nIn assessing the history of the presenting illness, you \nneed to cover a number of areas.\nThe problem\nFind out the nature of the patient’s problem, and the \npatient’s perception of his or her difficulties. This can, \nof course, be difficult if the patient is psychotic and \ndoes not believe that a psychiatric problem exists at \nall. In these cases a corroborative history must be taken. \nFor example, a manic patient may consider that there \nis nothing wrong and that his or her behaviour is \nreasonable, whereas the patient’s partner is able to \nrecognise that ordering an expensive new sports car \nwhen the family is impoverished is a problem.\nA range of symptoms commonly found in \npsychiatric disorders needs to be reviewed in the course \nof assessing the history of the present illness. These \ninclude mood change, anxiety, worry, sleep patterns, \nappetite, hallucinations and delusions. A set of simple \nscreening questions for each of the major diagnoses is \nlisted within Table 46.1.\nIt is especially important to ask about symptoms \nof anxiety and depression (the most common psychiatric \nText continued on p 851\n",

An assessment should be made of stresses that \nmay have contributed to past episodes of illness and \nthat may have led to relapse. For the past psychiatric \nhistory, it is important to obtain not only the diagnosis \nbut also the treatment the patient has had, and its \noutcome.\nAsk about previous non-drug treatment including \ncounselling, psychotherapy and electroconvulsive \ntherapy (ECT), and whether the patient thought the \ntreatment was effective. Was the patient ever admitted \nto a psychiatric unit, and for how long?\ndisorders). A simple screening approach to determine \nwhether the patient has depression is to ask him or \nher:2\n•\t ‘In the past month, have you felt down, \ndepressed or hopeless?’\n•\t ‘Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing \nthings?’\nIf the patient answers ‘yes’ to either question, you need \nto explore the possibility of depression in detail (LR+, \n2.9; LR–, 0.05).2\nScreening is encouraged to reduce the high rate of \nundetected depression. Use of such screening questions \nin all patients (where there will be a low prevalence—i.e. \na low pretest probability of depression) will lead to \nsome false-positive responses so detailed follow-up \nquestions are required to help confirm the results.3\nThe definitions of other symptoms are given in Table \n46.2. It is important to ask about drug usage (legal and \nillegal) as well as alcohol and caffeine intake (which \nmay be associated with anxiety disorders).\nPrecipitating events\nPsychiatric illness can occur for no reason (e.g. bipolar \ndisease episodes) but there is often an event that has \nprecipitated the illness, even though this may not be \nobvious at the beginning. Such events include a range \nof experiences that may have affected the patient or a \nmember of the patient’s social network. Events such \nas physical illness, drug treatment or treatment \nnon-adherence may be implicated as precipitants. \nPatients with psychiatric illnesses have a possibly \nundeserved reputation for non-adherence to treatment. \nIt may be no more common than in non-psychiatric \npatients but when it occurs it can be a major contribution \nto relapse.\nRisk\nAn assessment of the patient’s risk of harm, either to \nothers or to him- or herself, is essential: this will indicate \nany urgent steps that need to be taken to ensure safety \nand whether the patient needs to be treated involuntarily. \nPatients with psychotic illness may, in some \ncircumstances, need to be treated involuntarily under \nthe relevant legislation (e.g. Mental Health Act). \nAlthough the exact details for involuntary treatment \nare different under individual mental health laws, the \nessential features are generally that: (1) a person has \nAssessment of suicide risk\nSuicide may be the tragic outcome of \npsychiatric illness.

Drawing up a family tree is a useful way \nof finding this out. Factual details about each family \nmember can be included in this family tree (age, mental \nstate, health). In the psychiatric history one also needs \nto know what type of person each family member is, \nabout any important family events (such as bereavements, \nseparations) and how family members get on with each \nother. It is worth exploring the quality of care the patient \nreceived from each parent, and how controlling or \nprotective each was. These two factors have been shown \nto be important in contributing to psychiatric illness. \nAsk about the quality of the parental relationship and \nthe general family atmosphere.\nChildhood abuse (emotional, physical or sexual)4 \nmay be an important predisposing event for many \nillnesses, and should be enquired about.

These include \nassessing the patient’s cognitive state (orientation, \nmemory, attention, registration) and enquiring about \nperceptual disturbances and, in some cases, disorders \nof thought. The mental state examination provides \nvaluable diagnostic information; with some disorders, \nit is this examination that gives most of the diagnostic \nclues.\nThe headings under which the mental state is \nrecorded are shown in Table 46.4, together with some \nsimple bedside tests for assessing cognitive function. \nAlso shown in Table 46.4 are some abnormal features \nof the mental state examination that are commonly \nfound in psychiatric disorders.\nWhen cognitive dysfunction is suspected, as in \npatients with delirium or dementia,6 a more detailed \nexamination of cognitive function should be carried \nout. A widely used screening tool for doing this has \nbeen the mini-mental state examination (MMSE)TM,6 \nwhich assesses aspects of orientation, memory and \nconcentration. The MMSE is copyright protected. \nAnother useful screening tool is the simple three-step \n(3-minute) Mini-CogTM test.7 For this test, ask the \npatient to remember three words (repeat them up \nto three times to make sure that he or she has captured \nthe words correctly). Next, ask the patient to draw \na clock face with numbers and then draw the hands \nat a specified time (e.g. 11.10). Then ask the patient \nto repeat the original three words. Scoring is out of \n5: 1 point for each word remembered and 2 for a \ncorrect clock face drawing (0 if not fully correct). A \ntotal score of 0–2 supports a diagnosis of dementia.\nSome of the common causes of delirium and \ndementia are listed in Tables 46.5 and 46.6 respectively.\nTHE DIAGNOSIS\nAt the conclusion of the psychiatric history, which \nshould include a general physical examination, a \nprovisional diagnosis and formulation should be made. \nEssentially, the diagnostic formulation is a means of \nsummarising, in a succinct yet comprehensive manner, \nyour understanding of the patient’s problem.\nPsychiatric disorders generally arise through a \ncombination of biological, psychological and psy­\nchosocial factors, and each of these needs to be \nconsidered when a patient’s problem is being assessed \n(a biopsychosocial approach). The patient’s problem \nchildhood, such as head injuries or serious infections. \nHow did the patient cope with early separations, \nparticularly when starting primary school and going \non to secondary school (difficulty in separation may \nbe a risk factor for panic disorder or abnormal illness \nbehaviour)? The patient should be asked about peer \nrelationships, friendships, school, academic ability, \nadolescence and teenage relationships. The adult history \nshould focus predominantly on the quality of intimate \nrelationships and the social support network, especially \nwhether there are people in whom the patient can \nconfide, and about significant events that may have \noccurred and about the patient’s ability to cope with \nsuch events.\nThe patient’s living circumstances should be asked \nabout in the same way as for a medical history. There \nshould also be a focus on the patient’s occupation: not \nonly on the type of job but also on how he or she copes \nwith work or, if he or she does not work, how that is \ncoped with.\nPremorbid personality\nAn assessment should be made of the patient’s \npremorbid personality. Ask the patient to describe \nhim- or herself (e.g. ‘How would your friends or family \ndescribe you?’). The personality can be described using \nthe predominant trait, such as obsessional, nervy or \nhighly strung; it is not necessary to use official systems \nto describe a patient’s personality. In the assessment \nof premorbid personality it is important to evaluate \nboth positive and negative aspects of the person, how \nhe or she copes or responds to the strains of life, what \ntype of interests he or she has, and what other strengths \nand weaknesses are present.\nTHE MENTAL STATE \nEXAMINATION\nWhile assessing the patient, carefully make observations \nabout appearance, behaviour, patterns of speech, \npredominant concerns, attitude to the examiner and \nways of interacting. These observations are brought \ntogether in a systematic fashion in the mental state \nexamination. This is not something that is ‘done’ at the \nconclusion of taking a history; it is an essential part \nof the total process of assessing the patient.5\nHowever, there are a number of tests or specific \ntasks that need to be conducted in a formalised way \n",

Patients feel lack of control of their \neating. Unlike people who are merely greedy, \nthese patients feel guilt and self-disgust after \neating, often eat secretly to avoid embarrassment \nand feel physically uncomfortable after eating too \nmuch.\nSchizophrenia\nThis psychotic illness is associated with an increased \nrisk of death (2–3 times), of suicide (13 times) and \nof cardiovascular disease (twice). Patients have \nincreased rates of cardiovascular risk factors including: \nhypertension, smoking, hyperlipidaemia, obesity and \ndiabetes. They need medical assessment and help with \nthese problems, some of which are exacerbated by their \nmedication.\nThe condition begins usually in adolescence. At \nleast two of the following symptoms are required for \nthe diagnosis:\n•\t hallucinations\n•\t delusions\n•\t disorganised or catatonic behaviour\n•\t disorganised speech\n•\t negative symptoms—a flattened affect, alogia, \navolition.d\n1.\tBulimia nervosa is a condition in which frequent \n(more than once a week) episodes of binge eating \nare followed by compensating behaviours that are \npromoted by fear of weight gain. These include \ninduced vomiting, and use of laxatives, enemas \nor diuretics. Patients are at risk of the medical \ncomplications summarised in List 46.3.\nExamination findings include erosion of \ndental enamel from vomiting, parotid gland \nenlargement, xerosis (dryness of the mouth, eyes \nand skin) and scarring on the dorsum or \nknuckles of the hand used to induce vomiting \n(Russell’s sign).b,8 The sign is not present if an \nobject such as a pencil or toothbrush is used to \ninduce vomiting.\n2.\tAnorexia nervosa is associated with a \nconsiderable mortality risk. It occurs \npredominantly in women. They aggressively \nrestrict food intake because of a distorted body \nimage and fear of gaining weight. Adolescent \ngirls and young women are most commonly \naffected. The severe medical complications are \nslightly different from those of bulimia nervosa \n(List 46.4).\nAmenorrhoea is common but no longer \nrequired for the diagnosis.

Thoughts of suicide are \nless prominent. Periods of more severe major depression \nare common.\nSeasonal affective disorder\nThese patients have 3 successive years of major \nsymptoms of depression beginning in the autumn or \nwinter and resolving in spring. More women than men \nare affected.\nPeripartum depression\nThis condition is no longer called postpartum depression \nas 50% of women develop their symptoms during \npregnancy. Up to 15% of women are affected within 6 \nmonths of giving birth. It is considered a major \ndepressive disorder.\nBipolar disorder\nPeople affected by this relatively common mood \ndisorder (1% of people) have periods of mania or \nhypomania (see Table 46.1), usually with a history of \nmajor depressive disorder. The onset is usually in early \nadult life. Most patients also have periods of depression. \nThe features of an episode of mania include:\n•\t abnormally euphoric or irritable mood\n•\t pressured speech\n•\t flight of ideas\n•\t grandiosity (inflated self-importance)\n•\t agitation\n•\t disinhibited behaviour (spending sprees, sexual \npromiscuity)\n•\t little need for sleep\n•\t severe disruption of normal life.\nBipolar I disorder is diagnosed after one or more manic \nepisodes lasting at least a week. Bipolar II disorder is \ndiagnosed when patients have less severe symptoms \nof mania (hypomania) that last at least 4 days. These \npatients have episodes of major depression.\nThe symptoms must interfere with work, study, relations \nwith other people or self-care, and have been present \nfor 6 months. (See Questions box 46.9.)\nDepression\nAbout a fifth of women and 10% of men experience \ndepression during their lives. The peak age of onset is \n40 for women and 55 for men. Depression is both \nmore common in people with medical illnesses and \nadversely affects their recovery. Depression is a common \nreason for presentation to a doctor and a few simple \nquestions can help the clinician decide whether \ndepression is a major problem.\nA number of medical conditions can resemble \ndepression (see List 46.5).\nMajor depressive disorder\nThe current diagnosis of this requires that the patient \nhas five of the following symptoms within a 2-week \nperiod including at least symptom 1 or 2:\n1.\tMood is depressed most of the time—reported \neither by the patient or by others—with feelings \nof hopelessness and sadness.\n2.\tGreatly reduced interest in life, activities or \npleasure most of the time.\n3.\tUnintended loss or gain in weight or appetite.\n4.\tSleeping poorly or too much.\n5.\tAgitation or psychomotor retardation every day.\n6.\tLoss of energy and fatigue.\nMEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT MAY \nRESEMBLE DEPRESSION\n• \nHypothyroidism\n• \nAndrogen deficiency\n• Menopause\n• \nParkinson’s disease\n• \nMultiple sclerosis\n• \nChronic illness—HIV infection, heart failure\n• \nDrug treatment—interferons, \nchemotherapeutic agents\nHIV = human immunodeficiency virus.\nLIST 46.5 \n",

The lifetime \noccurrence is about 2.5% of people. Patients with this \ncondition have a persisting exaggerated fear of public \nperformances (e.g. public speaking) or of unfamiliar \nsocial situations (e.g. meeting new people). The \nsymptoms last for 6 months or longer. The anxiety \nis accompanied by physical symptoms such as \nbreathlessness, flushing and palpitations. Patients realise \ntheir anxiety is excessive but may go to great lengths \nto avoid situations that bring them on. Their normal \nlives (work, etc.) are affected by their symptoms.\nPost-traumatic stress \ndisorder (PTSD)\nPTSD occurs to people in response to seeing or directly \nexperiencing traumatic events such as violence, \nthreatened death, sexual assault or finding out about \nsuch an event happening to someone close. The \ndiagnosis requires at least 1 month of symptoms that \ninclude upsetting memories of the events, nightmares \nor flashbacks.

WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, Hamlet\nINITIAL ASSESSMENT\nDuring your training, you will be expected to become \nexpert in advanced life support and this training must \nbe refreshed regularly. If you come across an obviously \nvery ill patient, the first step is to ask, ‘Are you okay?’ \nIf the patient is unresponsive on gentle shaking, quickly \ncheck whether the airway is patent and if he or she is \nbreathing, then rapidly assess the circulation. This \nshould all take no more than 10 seconds. Start \ncardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR; see Fig. 47.1) if \nthe patient is not breathing (or is just gasping) or has \nno pulse, and try to send someone else to call for help. \nCurrent guidelines emphasise the importance of \nadequate chest compressions during CPR (at least \n100 / minute, compressing the centre of the chest 5 \ncentimetres with each downward compression, and no \ninterruptions—remember to push hard and fast).1\nIf the patient is clearly responding appropriately to \nquestions, and the skin is normal in colour as well as \nwarm and dry, the patient is much less likely to need \nurgent intervention before appropriate history taking \nand a full examination are completed. If the patient’s \nlevel of consciousness becomes impaired, recheck the \nairway, breathing and circulation (ABCs), check the \nserum glucose (you must not miss hypoglycaemia) and \nobtain intravenous access immediately.\nAn acutely ill patient who presents to hospital may \nbe able to give some history. Ask:\n•\t What is wrong?\n•\t What has happened?’\n•\t Have you been injured? Are you in pain \nanywhere?\nIf possible, while beginning your physical assessment \n(see Fig. 47.2) ask about previous medical problems \nsuch as heart disease, diabetes, asthma or depression. \nIf the patient is accompanied by others, ask these people \nif they have any more information. Look for an alert \nbracelet and for a list of medications in the patient’s \npockets.\nLEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS\nAssess the patient’s level of consciousness using the \nAVPU system:\nA\tlert (normal)\nV\t erbal stimulus responsive\nP\t ainful stimulus responsive\nU\t nresponsive patient.\nIf the patient only responds to a painful stimulus or \nis unresponsive, assess him or her using the Glasgow \nComa Scale (see Table 35.4, p 602).2\nGather key data, as summarised by the mnemonic \nAMPLE:\nA\tllergies\nM\tedication currently being taken and most \nrecent medications taken\nP\t ast medical history\nL\t ast meal\nE\t vents preceding the current incident.\nIf the patient is tachypnoeic, check pulse oximetry and \nstart oxygen therapy unless there is a known \ncontraindication.\nIf the patient is bradycardic or tachycardic, obtain \nan ECG.\nDELIRIUM\nDelirium is an acute change in cognitive function that \noccurs over hours or a few days. It is often associated \nwith acute medical conditions and therefore is often \nseen in hospital patients. It is important that it be \nrecognised and the cause removed or treated.

      "text": "CHAPTER 48 \nThe pre-anaesthetic medical evaluation (PAME)\nWhenever ideas fail, men invent words.  MARTIN H FISHER (1879–1962)\nAn appropriate medical evaluation of the patient who \nhas been admitted for elective surgery is always required. \nIt includes a history and examination that is sufficient \nto uncover any likely major problems with anaesthesia \nor the procedure itself.\nTHE HISTORY\nThe first thing to find out, of course, is the presenting \nproblem, what operation is intended and whether the \nsurgery is expected to be performed under general or \nlocal anaesthesia. Clearly the assessment of a patient \nhaving a small lesion removed under local anaesthesia \ncan be briefer than the assessment of a patient \nundergoing extensive bowel resection under general \nanaesthesia. As a rule, before any patient undergoes \nsurgery under general anaesthesia or spinal anaesthesia, \ncareful attention must be given to identifying whether \nhe or she is at higher risk.\nCardiovascular history\nThe most important questions here relate to a history \nof ischaemic heart disease. Patients who have had a \nmyocardial infarct in the preceding 3 months should \nnot usually undergo elective surgery; the risks of further \ninfarction or malignant arrhythmia and death are high \nduring this period. A patient who has symptoms of \nangina that have recently become unstable is also at \ngreater risk. A history of stable angina that has not \nchanged for months or years is not a contraindication \nto most forms of surgery. The recent placement of a \ncoronary stent may mean that cessation of antiplatelet \ndrugs is not safe for 1 month after insertion of a bare \nmetal stent and 6 months to 1 year after the insertion \nof a drug-eluting stent.\nSymptoms of cardiac failure should be sought. \nAny patient with uncontrolled cardiac failure is at \nconsiderable risk of severe cardiac failure postoperatively. \nThis is particularly true if large amounts of intravenous \nfluids are given during and after surgery while the \npatient’s antifailure drugs (e.g. diuretics) are omitted.\nCardiac drugs should be asked about, particularly \nantianginal and antifailure drugs. It is important to \nattempt to ensure that the patient receives these drugs, \nparticularly beta-blockers, on the day of the operation. \nThe surgeon may require the patient to stop aspirin a \nweek or more before surgery. This is usually a safe \nthing for the patient to do but may be a problem in \nthe first month at least after a coronary angioplasty \nbecause of the risk of thrombosis of the stent in this \nearly period. Previous coronary artery bypass grafting \nor angioplasty is not a contraindication to surgery.\nA history of infective endocarditis or the presence \nof a prosthetic cardiac valve or complex congenital \ncardiac condition is an indication for antibiotic \nprophylaxis for any procedure that may result in \nbacteraemia—the circulation of bacteria in the \nbloodstream. These procedures include most types of \ndental work and surgery on the bowel or bladder and \nsome gynaecological operations and vaginal delivery.\nPatients who take oral anticoagulants such as \nwarfarin or the new oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, \napixaban or rivaroxaban) require special attention. \nWhen the drug is being used to protect the patient \nfrom embolic events associated with atrial fibrillation \nit may be reasonable, on the balance of risks, to have \nthe drug stopped an appropriate period before surgery \nand resumed as soon as practical afterwards. If the \npatient takes the drug to protect a mechanical heart \nvalve from clot, the drug should, in general, be replaced \nby intravenous unfractionated or subcutaneous \nfractionated heparin. The last dose of fractionated \nheparin can be given about 12 hours before surgery \nand the drug recommenced as soon as the surgeon \nfeels it is safe. Many patients can administer the drug \nthemselves at home. Patients with mechanical valves, \n",

Patients who have continued to smoke up \nto the time of their surgery have a much higher risk of \npostoperative chest infections than those who have not. \nEven stopping a few weeks before will reduce this risk. \nSevere respiratory disease is a relative contraindication \nto surgery. It may be difficult to reverse the anaesthetic \nand muscle relaxant drugs in such a patient, and he or \nshe may require ventilation postoperatively. Doctors \nin charge of intensive care units are always happier \nto be warned that a patient may require ventilation \npostoperatively than to have it come as a surprise.\nDrug therapy for respiratory disease must be asked \nabout. Steroids may impair wound healing, and steroid \ndoses may need to be increased during the operative \nperiod because of steroid-induced adrenal suppression.\nOther\nEnquire about any history of bleeding diathesis, diabetes \nmellitus, renal disease, hepatitis, jaundice or drug abuse. \nThe control of blood sugar in diabetic patients can be \ndifficult in the perioperative period, especially while \nnormal diet is impossible. The fasting preoperative \ndiabetic on insulin may need to be advised to have \nhalf the normal insulin dose on the morning of surgery. \nThis may be important to avoid ketoacidosis.\nSpecific enquiries about previous operations \nand anaesthetics, particularly with reference to any \ncomplications, should be made. Allergies to anaesthetic \nagents or other drugs must be asked about. Attempt to \ndistinguish a true allergy or anaphylaxis from an adverse \neffect such as vomiting after a morphine injection. Some \noperations involve the use of contrast media, and an \nallergy to iodine may be a contraindication to their \nuse. This risk is now much less with the new non-ionic \ncontrast media. There may occasionally be a family \nhistory of anaesthetic complications or deaths. This \nraises the possibility of malignant hyperthermia, which \nis an inherited disorder leading to fever and muscle \ndestruction after administration of muscle relaxants.\nAsk about exercise tolerance. How far can the patient \nwalk? How many flights of stairs can the patient climb? \nPoor functional status is indicated by an inability to \nwalk one or two blocks on the flat.\nTHE EXAMINATION\nExamination according to the rapid screening method \noutlined in Chapter 51 represents the best approach. \nRecord height, weight and vital signs (pulse rate, blood \npressure, respiratory rate). The cardiovascular and \nrespiratory systems must be fully examined. Patients \nwith a short thick neck may be difficult to ventilate \nand intubate. It is better for the anaesthetist to be aware \nof this possible problem before the patient is given a \nmuscle relaxant and is unable to breathe spontaneously. \nThe presence of loose or fragile teeth must also be \nnoted because of the risk of their dislodgement during \nattempted intubation.\nIf a previously undiagnosed symptom or sign of \nsignificance is uncovered, some further investigations \nmay be required before surgery, and the operation may \nhave to be deferred. For example, the discovery of a \nnew and significant heart murmur, uncontrolled \nhypertension, respiratory failure, a bleeding diathesis, \nuncontrolled diabetes mellitus or renal failure should \nbe brought to the attention of the surgeon and \nanaesthetist.\n",

      "text": "CHAPTER 49 \nAssessment of death\nI’m not afraid of death; I just don’t want to be there when it happens.  WOODY ALLAN\nWe all die eventually, although most of us try not to \nruminate on the subject. The certification of a patient’s \ndeath is one of the legal responsibilities of a doctor. \nThe experience can be distressing for the doctor as \nwell as the patient’s relatives. Students should be given \nthe opportunity to observe senior colleagues performing \nthese tasks and to learn what is required technically \nand emotionally. Clearly, the declaration that a patient \nhas died must be correct, as well as sympathetically \nperformed.\nDeath is not easy to define in absolute terms but \ngenerally means brain death—an irreversible loss of \nconsciousness, usually but not always linked to an \nirreversible loss of spontaneous respiration.\nASSESSMENT\nIf you are called to assess an unresponsive patient, do not \nassume that the patient has died: start cardiopulmonary \nresuscitation (CPR) immediately (see p 868) and call for \nhelp, unless there is a confirmed and current advance \ncare directive or resuscitation plan.\nDo-not-resuscitate \n(DNR) orders\nMost hospitals have specific policies in place about \nresuscitation. Patients have the right to make a living \nwill or advance directive outlining their wishes \nconcerning resuscitation; for example, a patient with \na terminal condition can elect to refuse CPR or life \nsupport if cardiac arrest occurs. The directive, if known, \nshould be honoured. Remember, however, that if the \npatient had changed his or her mind before collapsing \nand notified staff verbally, the current verbal decision \nrather than the written directive must be honoured \n(i.e. you should provide CPR or life support). Sometimes, \ndirectives may be more specific. For example, a directive \nmay forbid intubation. It would be wrong in this case \nto deny the patient an attempt at cardioversion from \nventricular fibrillation, but it may be reasonable not \nto proceed to more invasive resuscitation. If the patient \nis unknown to you, it is important to err on the side \nof caution and begin resuscitation.\nDo not misdiagnose death\nThe dead patient is unresponsive, has no spontaneous \nrespiratory movements, has no pulse or heart sounds, \nis very pale and usually the eyes are open and blankly \nstaring. Red–purple discoloration in gravity-dependent \nareas occurs about half an hour after death, while rigor \nmortis (muscle stiffening) occurs hours later.\nNote that death can be and has been diagnosed in \nerror most often in patients on a ventilator. Important \nconditions to exclude before declaring a person is dead \ninclude:\n•\t hypothermia\n•\t near-drowning\n•\t drug overdose (especially alcohol and \ntranquillisers)\n•\t hypoglycaemia\n•\t other causes of deep coma, or severe catatonia.\nIn these cases, some cardiac and respiratory activity \nwill be present.\nExamining a suspected death\nList 49.1 summarises the physical examination to \nconfirm death. After brain death there may still be \nspontaneous movements from the denervated spinal \ncord or peripheral nerves—examples include flexion \nof the neck, elbows and trunk (when dramatic, known \nas the ‘Lazarus sign’) or finger flexor movements.\nRemember, certifying death has medicolegal \nconsequences.

Where possible, you should include \nthe likely cause of death, and sign your name (legibly). \nYou are required to notify the authorities of any \nunexpected or suspect death.\nBrainstem death\nPatients on a mechanical ventilator require additional \ntesting to confirm that they are truly dead.\nPotentially reversible causes must always be excluded \n(especially drugs; see above). There have been cases \nwhere brain death has been pronounced and the patient \nhas later woken up.\nDo not miss the rare locked-in syndrome. This can \noccur following an embolus blocking the basilar artery \nor some other local injury to the base of the pons. The \nunfortunate patient is not unconscious at all, but cannot \nmove any face, limb or trunk muscles. You can identify \nthe syndrome by asking the patient to blink once for \n‘yes’ and twice for ‘no’; voluntary blinking as well as \nvertical eye movements are not affected.\nTesting protocols are based on the law, which vary \nby country and state (check the requirements in your \nstate). Traditionally, testing is carried out by two \ndifferent doctors on two separate occasions, typically \n24 hours apart, to ensure that the state is irreversible \n(but the timing of repeat testing is dependent on the \npatient’s age and likely cause of death). Testing typically \nincludes a physical examination (as per List 49.1), an \nobvious lack of any response to suctioning the tracheal \ntube, plus an ice-water (oculovestibular reflex) test: no \neye response to irrigation of ice-cold water into the \nears. If the examination indicates brain death, a \nmedullary brainstem hypercapnia test is performed, \nwhereby the ventilator is ceased while giving 100% \noxygen and the arterial CO2 is permitted to rise above \na preset threshold (>6.7 kPa). Seeing no respiratory \neffort after 8–10 minutes indicates that there is no \nmedullary function.\nINFORMING RELATIVES\nInforming relatives is always difficult but is the \nresponsibility of the certifying doctor. It is one of the \nhardest things doctors have to do. Give the news in \nperson—this will usually be deeply appreciated. Break \nthe bad news professionally and compassionately. Seek \na private and quiet environment, speak clearly and \nconcisely, be supportive, respect cultural and religious \nbeliefs and engage the help of the team (e.g. nurse, \nsocial worker, and cleric). Relatives often want to know \nwhat happened, particularly if the death is unexpected. \nIf the patient is well known to you, you may be able \nto provide that explanation; if not, you should suggest \nthe relatives arrange to meet the consultant responsible \nfor the patient to discuss the issues.\nCOMPLETING THE \nDEATH CERTIFICATE\nThe death certificate is a legal document. If the death \nwas expected (and not suspect), you should complete \nthe certificate as soon as possible. The World Health \nOrganization (WHO) provides a certificate format that \nis applied internationally. Certify the disease that led \ndirectly to death (in part I of the form), as well as any \nother diseases that contributed (in part II of the form).\n",

HENRY JAMES (1843–1916)\nIt is important that the medical record be kept succinct \nand relevant. The following approach is the one \nrecommended by the authors. The detail of the history \nand examination and its record varies of course, \ndepending on whether this is a first visit and on the \ncomplexity of the presenting problem. It is not necessary \nto ask every patient every question.\nHISTORY\nPersonal information\nRecord the name, sex, date of birth and address. Write \ndown the date and time of the examination.\nPresenting (principal) symptoms (PS)\nA short sentence identifies the major symptoms and \ntheir duration; it is often useful to quote the patient’s \nown words.\nHistory of present illness (HPI)\nDon’t record every detail; rather, prepare short prose \nparagraphs telling the story of the illness in chronological \norder. Describe the characteristics of each symptom. \nNote why the patient presents at this time. Also, describe \nany past medical problems that are related to the current \nsymptoms. Include the relevant positive and negative \nfindings on the system review here. Note how the \ndiagnosis was reached, side effects and response to \ntreatment. If there are many seemingly unrelated \nproblems, summarise these in an introductory paragraph \nand present the history of each problem in separate \nparagraphs.\nList current medications and doses and the \nindications for their use, if they are known, and any \nside effects, or known or measured therapeutic effects. \nFor example, if the patient takes antihypertensive drugs \nask whether blood pressure control has been satisfactory \nas far as the patient knows, or haemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) \nif the patient has diabetes mellitus. Finally, record your \nimpression of the reliability of the history and, if the \npatient was unable to give the history, describe the \nsource of this information.\nPast history (PH)\nList, in chronological order, past medical or surgical \nproblems (sometimes called inactive problems), past \nmedication use, if relevant, and any history of allergy \n(particularly drug allergy) or of drug intolerance. Find \nout what the problem with the drug was. The patient \nmay know the results of certain previous important \ninvestigations (e.g. ‘The scan showed I had clots in my \nlung’). A history of blood transfusions should be noted.\nSocial history (SH)\nThis may include recording the patient’s occupation, \nschooling, hobbies, marital status, family structure, \npersonal support system, living conditions and recent \ntravel. The number and gender of sexual partners may \nbe relevant. Smoking, alcohol and other recreational \ndrug use should also be described. Ask about ability \nto perform the activities of daily living (ADL) if elderly. \nIf a patient has a chronic illness, ask about the effect \nof this on his or life. If it is appropriate, ask about \nadvance care planning.\n",

(See \nCh 51.)\nPROVISIONAL DIAGNOSIS\nAsk yourself the following questions when considering \nthe differential diagnosis of a patient’s major symptoms.\n1.\tWhat is the likely diagnosis based on the \npatient’s age, sex and background?\n2.\tAre there other conditions that resemble the \nlikely diagnosis but can present in the same way?\n3.\tIs there a serious disorder, even if rare, that must \nnot be missed?\n4.\tCould the patient have a specific condition that \noften masquerades as (or mimics) other \nconditions (e.g. depression, drugs, diabetes \nmellitus, thyroid dysfunction, anaemia, \nmalignancy, spinal cord disease, urinary \ninfection, renal failure, alcoholism, syphilis, \ntuberculosis, HIV infection, infective \nendocarditis or connective tissue disease)?\n5.\tIs the patient trying to really tell me that there is \nan emotional or psychological problem?\nAn example of a patient history is presented in \nBox 50.1.\nPROBLEM LIST AND PLANS\nUsing a sentence or two, summarise the most important \nfindings and then give a provisional diagnosis (PD) \nand differential diagnosis (DD).\nRemember Occam’s razor: choose the simplest \nhypothesis to explain any new observations. Also \nremember Sutton’s law: the famous bank robber said he \nrobbed banks because ‘That’s where the money is’—that \nis, consider a common diagnosis before resorting to \na rare one to explain the symptoms and signs. Older \npatients are more likely to have multiple co-morbidities.\nIt is often useful to ask yourself whether the patient’s \nproblem is a diagnostic or management one (or both). \nFor example, a patient with the new onset of dyspnoea \npresents both a diagnostic problem—‘What is the cause \nof the breathlessness?’ and a management problem—\n‘How should the condition be treated?’ The patient \nwho presents with a worsening of previously diagnosed \nangina presents only a management problem—‘How \nshould the symptoms be treated?’\nList all the active problems that require management. \nOutline the diagnostic tests and therapy planned for \neach problem.\nSign your name and then print your name and \nposition underneath.\nCONTINUATION NOTES\nDate (and time) each progress note in the record. The \nSOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plans) \nformat can be useful.\nSubjective data refer to what the patient tells you; \nlist relevant current problems and note any new \nproblems. Have the patient’s previous symptoms \nimproved on the current treatment?\nObjective data are physical or laboratory findings; \nrelevant data for each active problem are summarised.\nAssessment refers to the interpretation of any relevant \nfindings for each problem.\nPlans describe any interventions that will be started \nfor each problem.\nMany patient records are now kept in a computer \nfile. Parts of this can be used to provide referral \ninformation for the patient to take to a specialist or if \nhe or she is travelling. It is important that such files \nbe kept up to date and especially that lists of medications \nthat are no longer used are deleted from the current \nlist before it is given to the patient.\nPRESENTATION1\nIn their formal examinations and less formally on the \nwards, students and resident medical officers will often \nbe expected to present the history and physical \nexamination of a patient to an examiner or senior \ncolleague. This is excellent training for clinical practice, \nas the need to discuss patients with colleagues or \n",

The examiner is most interested in what the \npatient’s problems are now. One should aim to convey \nbasic biographical information and an assessment of \nthe patient’s presenting problem in the first few \nsentences. It is often helpful to frame the presentation \nof the case as a diagnostic or management problem, \nor both.\nThe information will have been obtained from the \npatient by taking the history as set out above. The \nexamination of the patient should be performed with \nparticular attention to the areas most likely to be \nabnormal. This information must then be assembled \ninto a form that can easily be conveyed to others. The \nfollowing is a suggested method.\n1.\tBegin with a sentence that tells your colleague \nabout the essence of the patient and the clinical \nproblem. For example, one might say ‘Mr Jones \nis a 72-year-old retired cabinet minister who \npresents with 2 hours of chest pain which is not \ntypically ischaemic’. This gives an idea about the \npatient himself and indicates that the problem is \nlikely to be a diagnostic one.\n2.\tOne should then go on to explain in what \nway the pain is atypical of ischaemia and \nwhether it has features suggestive of any other \ndiagnosis.\n3.\tOnce the presenting symptom or problem has \nbeen described, relevant past history should be \ndiscussed. In a patient with chest pain this would \ninclude any previous cardiac history or \ninvestigations, and a summary of the patient’s \nrisk factors for ischaemic heart disease.\n4.\tPresent a list of the patient’s current \nmedications.\n5.\tImportant previous health problems should be \noutlined briefly. This retired cabinet minister \nmight also have a history of intermittent \nclaudication and of chronic obstructive \npulmonary disease. These facts will affect \npossible treatment for ischaemic heart disease, \ne.g. the use of beta-blockers.\n6.\tPresent the physical examination in two parts.\n\t\na.\t Abnormal and important normal examination \nfindings in the presenting system—in this \npatient’s case this would mean giving the \npulse rate and blood pressure but not details \nof normal heart sounds. If there was a history \nof claudication, the examination of the \nperipheral pulses should be presented even if \nit is normal.\n\t\nb.\t Abnormal findings in the rest of the \nexamination.\n7.\tOffer the most likely diagnosis and the \ndifferential diagnosis.\n8.\tSuggest a plan for investigation and treatment.\n9.\tMuch more detail will have been obtained in the \nassessment of the patient than should be \npresented routinely, but further details may be \nasked for by your colleague. These may include \ninformation about the patient’s living conditions \nand the availability of support from the family. \nThis may determine how soon the patient can be \nsent home from hospital after treatment.\nBy the end of your presentation your colleague should \nknow what you think is wrong with the patient and \nwhat you intend to do about it.\nReference\n1.\t Kroenke K.
