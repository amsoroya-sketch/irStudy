The purpose of shared care is to improve the quality and convenience \nof care for women.\nReferring women to KEMH\nIn 2014, the Department of Health launched the Central Referral Service (CRS) \nto manage specialist outpatient referrals in the public health system. \nAntenatal referrals\nAt the time of publication, antenatal referrals were outside the scope of the \nCentral Referral Service. Please refer to the Health Professionals page of the \nKEMH website for updates.\nRoutine referrals\nGPs are requested to refer low risk antenatal patients to their local maternity \nservice based on their postcode of residence. (See Table 1 on page 4)\nGPs are requested to clearly indicate their intention to share care on the referral.\nFor low-risk women who are referred to KEMH, the first visit is usually at 14-20 \nweeks gestation. If GPs are unsure if a woman is low or high risk, they can refer \nto the local maternity service which will assess the referral and send on to KEMH \nif required. All secondary maternity services (except Bentley Health Service) are \nable to take women with a BMI up to 40.\nHigh risk antenatal patients may be referred directly to KEMH Outpatient \nDepartment. Please refer early as these women may need to be seen at an \nearlier gestation.\nFax: (08) 6458 1031\nReferrals for women requiring review within 7 days\nIf the woman resides within KEMH catchment area, the GP should contact \nKEMH Clinical Midwifery Nurse Manager (Ambulatory Services)  \nPhone (08) 6458 2222 page 3419.\nIf woman resides outside KEMH catchment area, the GP needs to contact their \nlocal maternity service to discuss the referral. \n",

This field is rapidly evolving. Position statements from several \ninternational organisations (e.g. International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis, \nAmerican Congress of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists) regarding the clinical \nuse of NIPT are available online. \nPathWest and most private pathology providers offer NIPT. It is not currently \nfunded by Medicare and patients are required to pay out of pocket for this \nservice. KEMH does not offer NIPT except in a strictly limited number of high \nrisk women with contraindications to invasive diagnostic testing, where it is \nconsidered on a case-by-case basis. Turnaround times are up to 14 days from \nsample collection. In 5% of cases, the level of cell free fetal DNA is not great \nenough to report a result and a recollection is required.\nNIPT may be employed in screening for aneuploidy in two ways:\n1.\t As a primary screening modality, where a maternal blood sample is \ncollected after 10 weeks gestation. This allows a detection rate of around \n99% for trisomy 21, with a positive predictive value of around 80% in \nthe average-risk population. False positive results do occur, and results \nshould be confirmed with invasive testing prior to acting on the result. All \nwomen who have primary NIPT screening MUST also be offered a 12-\nweek ultrasound scan to assess for major fetal structural anomalies and to \ndetermine the chorionicity of multiple pregnancies. \n2.\t As a secondary screening modality, in women who have screened \nhigh risk with either the first trimester screen (FTS) or maternal serum \nscreen. This approach avoids the risks of invasive diagnostic testing. Some \nauthorities advocate offering NIPT to women at intermediate risk after FTS, \nsuch as those of risk 1:2500 or greater, to improve the detection rate of \ntrisomy 21. Such an approach may detect around 98% of cases of trisomy \n21, by performing NIPT in those 20% of women who screen at intermediate \nrisk by FTS.\nNIPT has wider applications which are evolving rapidly with technological \nadvances. NIPT is currently being marketed for rare microdeletion syndromes \n(e.g. “22q” or Di George Syndrome). Routine use of these “extended panels” is \nnot currently recommended due to a relatively high false positive rate and low \npositive predictive value.\n",

Normal haemoglobin contains a haem molecule that combines \nwith four globin chains; two are classified as alpha and two as beta chains. \nThalassaemia results from decreased synthesis of the globin chains in adult \nhaemoglobin. It is classified as alpha (α)-thalassaemia when there is absent or \ndecreased α-chain synthesis, or beta (β)-thalassaemia when there is absent or \ndecreased β-chain synthesis.\nSickle cell disease occurs when the structure of the beta globin chain is \nabnormal. Defective genes produce abnormal haemoglobin beta chains \nresulting in Haemoglobin S (HbS). Sickle cell disease (HbSS) occurs when \nabnormal genes are inherited from both parents.

Packed cells have a shorter half life than a \npatient’s own red blood cells and thus, the patient may experience a fall in \nHaemoglobin (Hb) on discharge. Women are likely to be discharged on oral \niron supplementation to counter this.

Post partum haemorrhage can occur \nvery quickly and may involve a sudden requirement for transfer to an operating \ntheatre, a general anaesthetic, being parted from a newborn infant and in \nsevere cases being asked to consent to a hysterectomy. For many women it is \nnot until they leave hospital that questions and concerns regarding what was \noccurring at this time emerge.  \nIt is important that any issues are addressed promptly as postnatal depression \nand rarely post traumatic stress disorder have been seen in women following \nmajor PPH. If you feel your patient requires further debriefing or discussion \nplease contact the treating team at KEMH who will organise a time to see her.\nImplications for future pregnancies\nPost partum haemorrhage has up to a 10% recurrence rate. Your patient’s \nhistory should be made aware to any obstetrician or obstetric unit you refer her \nto.  Maintaining an adequate antepartum Hb and active management of the \nthird stage of labour would be recommended in future pregnancies.\nRare complications\nAsherman’s Syndrome, intra-uterine adhesions caused by endometrial \ndamage from curettage, is a rare complication following PPH. Infertility is \nthe most common clinical presentation but patient’s may also present with \nhypomenorrhoea or amenorrhoea, cyclical pelvic pain or recurrent pregnancy \nloss.

Severe cases present in the first few days to weeks post partum with \nlethargy, anorexia, loss of weight and an inability to lactate. Less severe cases \nmay not present for many weeks to months and involve an inability to lactate, \nfailure to resume menses and a loss of pubic hair. Mild fatigue, anorexia and \nweight loss can also occur in less severe cases. On investigation growth \nhormone, prolactin, gonadotrophin and thyroid stimulating hormone levels \nare all deficient.
