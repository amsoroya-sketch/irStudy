## Review Methodology Notes

**Sequential Workflow:**
1. Clinical_Accuracy_Agent reviews module → generates report
2. If critical issues found → Fix → Re-review (iterate until clean)
3. Australian_Standards_Agent reviews same module → generates report
4. If critical issues found → Fix → Re-review
5. OSCE_Format_Agent reviews same module → generates report
6. If critical issues found → Fix → Re-review
7. All 3 agents approved for module → Module passes Quality Gate 1
8. Repeat for all 45 modules
9. Quality Gate 1 sign-off → Proceed to Tier 2

**Parallel Processing:**
- Tier 1 agents can work on different modules simultaneously
- Medicine modules (14 files) have priority
- Fix → Re-review iterations happen in parallel where possible
