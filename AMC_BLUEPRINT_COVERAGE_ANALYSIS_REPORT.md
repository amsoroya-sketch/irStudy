## Critical Gaps Identified

**NONE** - No critical gaps requiring immediate attention before ICRP commencement.

---

## Important Gaps Identified

### Important Gap #1: Anaphylaxis Management Scenario
**AMC Competency:** Emergency Management
**AMC Weight:** 10% (emergency management category)
**Prevalence in OSCE:** High (common AMC emergency scenario)
**Current Coverage:** Mentioned but no dedicated scenario
**Impact:** Anaphylaxis is a high-yield AMC topic. Candidates should know IM adrenaline dose (0.5mg 1:1000), anaphylaxis criteria, and management algorithm.
**Recommendation:** Create dedicated anaphylaxis management scenario with:
- Recognition criteria
- IM adrenaline administration (dose, site, timing)
- Supportive management (oxygen, fluids, antihistamines, corticosteroids)
- Biphasic reaction warning
- Discharge planning with adrenaline auto-injector prescription
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Priority:** IMPORTANT (should address post-ICRP for AMC Clinical exam prep)

---

### Important Gap #2: DKA/HHS Acute Management
**AMC Competency:** Emergency Management
**AMC Weight:** 10% (emergency management category)
**Prevalence in OSCE:** Medium (appears periodically in AMC)
**Current Coverage:** Diabetes management covers prevention, not acute crisis
**Impact:** DKA is a medical emergency. Candidates should know fluid resuscitation, insulin protocols, potassium replacement, and monitoring.
**Recommendation:** Add DKA/HHS acute management section to Endocrinology module with:
- Recognition (hyperglycemia, ketosis, acidosis)
- Fluid resuscitation (0.9% saline, then 0.45% saline)
- Insulin infusion (0.1 units/kg/hr)
- Potassium replacement protocols
- Bicarbonate indications (pH <7.0)
- Monitoring (hourly BGL, VBG, electrolytes)
**Estimated Effort:** 3 hours
**Priority:** IMPORTANT (should address post-ICRP)

---

### Important Gap #3: ECG Interpretation Systematic Approach
**AMC Competency:** Interpretation Skills
**AMC Weight:** 5% (interpretation skills category)
**Prevalence in OSCE:** High (ECGs frequently appear in AMC stations)
**Current Coverage:** ECG findings mentioned in context (STEMI, AF), but no systematic interpretation framework
**Impact:** Systematic ECG interpretation is expected AMC competency. Candidates should use structured approach: Rate, Rhythm, Axis, P waves, PR interval, QRS complex, ST segments, T waves.
**Recommendation:** Create ECG Interpretation module with:
- Systematic approach framework
- Rate calculation methods
- Rhythm recognition (sinus, AF, flutter, heart blocks)
- Axis determination
- STEMI recognition (ST elevation criteria)
- Common abnormalities (LBBB, RBBB, LVH, RVH)
- Practice ECGs with answers
**Estimated Effort:** 4 hours
**Priority:** IMPORTANT (desirable for AMC preparation, not critical for ICRP)
