## AMC Clinical / OSCE Standards

### OSCE Structure Requirements
All OSCE materials MUST follow this structure:
1. **Opening Statement** - Examiner-friendly introduction (30 seconds)
2. **Focused History** - Systematic approach with key questions
3. **Examination Steps** - Clear, sequential physical examination
4. **Differentials** - Top 3 differential diagnoses (ranked by likelihood)
5. **Investigations** - Appropriate for Australian context (Medicare, PBS)
6. **Management** - According to Australian guidelines (eTG, AMH)
7. **Counselling & Safety-netting** - Patient communication + red flags

### Clinical Systems Coverage
OSCE materials MUST cover all systems:
- **Medicine**: Cardiovascular, Respiratory, Gastroenterology, Neurology, Endocrine
- **Surgery**: Acute abdomen, Trauma, Surgical emergencies
- **Paediatrics**: Common childhood illnesses, developmental assessment, immunization
- **O&G**: Pregnancy care, gynecological complaints, contraception counseling
- **Psychiatry**: Mental state exam, risk assessment, common psychiatric presentations
- **Ethics**: Consent, confidentiality, breaking bad news, cultural safety

### High-Yield OSCE Templates (Mandatory)
Must include course-style frameworks for:
- Chest pain (cardiac vs non-cardiac)
- Shortness of breath (acute vs chronic)
- Abdominal pain (surgical vs medical)
- Headache (primary vs secondary, red flags)
- Red flags & emergencies (sepsis, PE, MI, stroke, ectopic pregnancy)
- Communication stations (breaking bad news, informed consent, angry patient, interpreter use)

### Role-Play Requirements
All communication stations MUST include:
- **Exact Phrases** - Word-for-word scripts that examiners expect
- **Australian Communication Style** - Culturally appropriate, patient-centered
- **Common Scenarios**:
  - Breaking bad news (cancer diagnosis, stillbirth)
  - Informed consent (surgery, procedure)
  - Difficult conversations (DNR, withdrawal of care)
  - Cultural safety (Indigenous health, interpreter use)
  - Angry/demanding patient
  - Domestic violence disclosure

### Mock OSCE Standards
All mock stations MUST include:
- **Examiner Checklist** - Observable criteria (like real AMC Clinical)
- **Pass / Borderline / Fail Criteria** - Clear thresholds
- **Time Allocation** - 8 minutes (like AMC Clinical exam)
- **Common Mistakes** - Specific errors IMGs commonly make
- **Scoring Rubric** - Points allocation for each section

### Australian Medical Context (CRITICAL)
All content MUST use Australian standards:
- **Spelling**: colour, paediatric, oestrogen, anaemia (NOT color, pediatric, estrogen, anemia)
- **Guidelines**: eTG (Therapeutic Guidelines), AMH (Australian Medicines Handbook)
- **Referrals**: GP, Emergency Department, Specialist (NOT PCP, ER, Attending)
- **Investigations**: Medicare-funded (list bulk-billed vs out-of-pocket)
- **Medications**: PBS-listed (note restrictions), brand names common in Australia
- **Units**: SI units (mmol/L for glucose, NOT mg/dL)

### Validation Checklist for OSCE Materials
Before marking OSCE content as complete, verify:
- [ ] Opening statement is <30 seconds and examiner-friendly
- [ ] History follows SOCRATES for pain / systematic approach for other complaints
- [ ] Physical examination uses "Preparation, Position, Permission, Perform, Present"
- [ ] Top 3 differentials are evidence-based and ranked
- [ ] Investigations are appropriate for Australian primary care setting
- [ ] Management follows current Australian guidelines (cite eTG/AMH edition)
- [ ] Safety-netting includes specific red flags to return for
- [ ] Australian spelling and terminology used throughout
- [ ] Time estimates realistic (8 min for stations, 15 min for practice)
- [ ] Common IMG mistakes documented with corrections

### Anti-Patterns for OSCE Materials
- ❌ DON'T use US guidelines (UpToDate without Australian context)
- ❌ DON'T use US drug names (acetaminophen → paracetamol)
- ❌ DON'T skip communication skills (Australian examiners heavily weight this)
- ❌ DON'T create generic stations (must be specific, realistic scenarios)
- ❌ DON'T ignore cultural safety (Indigenous health, CALD patients)
- ❌ DON'T forget time pressure (real exam is 8 min/station)
- ❌ DON'T use medical jargon with patients (explain in lay terms)
- ❌ DON'T skip consent/confidentiality in every relevant station
