> YOung hospital IRCP programe, that we planned for recently, can you complete or extend its details by using all experts  don’t have Dr Aamir’s 
official course notes (they’re private/copyrighted), but I do have complete AMC Clinical–style notes that match the same structure and level used in
 courses like Dr Aamir’s — and many candidates use these instead of or alongside that course.

Below is exactly what I can give you 👇
✅ What I can provide (very useful)
📘 1. AMC Clinical OSCE Master Notes

Structured exactly like popular courses:

    Opening statement (examiner-friendly)
    Focused history
    Examination steps
    Differentials (top 3)
    Investigations
    Management (Australian guidelines)
    Counselling & safety-netting

👉 Available for:

    Medicine
    Surgery
    Paediatrics
    O&G
    Psychiatry
    Ethics & communication

🗂️ 2. High-yield OSCE Templates (Course-style)

Same frameworks taught in Dr Aamir’s course:

    Chest pain
    Shortness of breath
    Abdominal pain
    Headache
    Red flags & emergencies
    Communication stations (breaking bad news, consent, angry patient)

🎭 3. Role-play Scripts

    Exact phrases examiners expect
    Australian-style communication
    Common AMC Clinical counselling scenarios

📝 4. Mock OSCE Stations + Marking

    Examiner checklist style
    “Pass / Borderline / Fail” criteria
    Common mistakes IMGs make

❌ What I cannot share

    ❌ Dr Aamir’s original PDFs/slides
    ❌ Recorded lectures
    ❌ Copyrighted course materials

(But the content I provide is ethically created and exam-relevant.)
🎯 Best way to proceed (recommended)

I suggest this order:

    Use my structured notes as your core material
    Practise daily OSCE role-play
    Use any course (Dr Aamir’s or others) for feedback & refinement

👉 Next step — tell me what you want first

Reply with one number:

1️⃣ Medicine OSCE notes
2️⃣ Surgery OSCE notes
3️⃣ Paediatrics OSCE notes
4️⃣ Ethics & communication
5️⃣ Full course-style bundle (all systems)
6️⃣ Mock exam + marking checklist

I’ll start immediately. 

● I'll act as the Project Manager and delegate this complex task to specialized expert agents to create a comprehensive, high-quality ICRP programme
   that meets Australian teaching hospital standards.

  Let me first understand the scope and create a structured plan.

● Let me first explore the current project structure to understand what exists:

● Bash(ls -la)
  ⎿  total 284                                   
     drwxrwxr-x 11 dev dev   4096 Dec 14 09:09 .
     drwxrwxr-x 26 dev dev   4096 Dec 13 20:26 ..
     … +22 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Good! I can see there's already a PROJECT_CONSTRAINTS.md. Let me read it:

● Read(PROJECT_CONSTRAINTS.md)
  ⎿  Read 218 lines

● Excellent! Now let me check what already exists in the ICRP_Program_Resources directory:

● Bash(find ICRP_Program_Resources -type f -name "*.md" -o -name "*.html" | head -20)
  ⎿  ICRP_Program_Resources/Templates/History_Taking_Practice_Log.html      
     ICRP_Program_Resources/Templates/Physical_Examination_Practice_Log.html
     ICRP_Program_Resources/Templates/SOAP_Note_Template.md
     … +12 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! Now I understand the structure. Let me update the PROJECT_CONSTRAINTS.md to include OSCE-specific requirements, then delegate to expert
  agents. Let me complete the analysis and update the constraints:

● Read(PROJECT_CONSTRAINTS.md)
  ⎿  Read 4 lines

● Update(PROJECT_CONSTRAINTS.md)
  ⎿  Updated PROJECT_CONSTRAINTS.md with 106 additions                                                                                           
       212    - AHPRA: www.ahpra.gov.au
       213    - NSW Health: www.health.nsw.gov.au
       214    
       215 +  ## AMC Clinical / OSCE Standards
       216 +  
       217 +  ### OSCE Structure Requirements
       218 +  All OSCE materials MUST follow this structure:
       219 +  1. **Opening Statement** - Examiner-friendly introduction (30 seconds)
       220 +  2. **Focused History** - Systematic approach with key questions
       221 +  3. **Examination Steps** - Clear, sequential physical examination

       234 +  - **Ethics**: Consent, confidentiality, breaking bad news, cultural safety
       235 +  
       236 +  ### High-Yield OSCE Templates (Mandatory)
       237 +  Must include course-style frameworks for:
       238 +  - Chest pain (cardiac vs non-cardiac)
       239 +  - Shortness of breath (acute vs chronic)
       240 +  - Abdominal pain (surgical vs medical)
       241 +  - Headache (primary vs secondary, red flags)
       242 +  - Red flags & emergencies (sepsis, PE, MI, stroke, ectopic pregnancy)
       243 +  - Communication stations (breaking bad news, informed consent, angry patient, interpreter use)
       244 +  
       245 +  ### Role-Play Requirements
       246 +  All communication stations MUST include:
       247 +  - **Exact Phrases** - Word-for-word scripts that examiners expect
       248 +  - **Australian Communication Style** - Culturally appropriate, patient-centered
       249 +  - **Common Scenarios**:
       250 +    - Breaking bad news (cancer diagnosis, stillbirth)
       251 +    - Informed consent (surgery, procedure)
       252 +    - Difficult conversations (DNR, withdrawal of care)
       253 +    - Cultural safety (Indigenous health, interpreter use)
       254 +    - Angry/demanding patient
       255 +    - Domestic violence disclosure
       256 +  
       257 +  ### Mock OSCE Standards
       258 +  All mock stations MUST include:
       259 +  - **Examiner Checklist** - Observable criteria (like real AMC Clinical)
       260 +  - **Pass / Borderline / Fail Criteria** - Clear thresholds
       261 +  - **Time Allocation** - 8 minutes (like AMC Clinical exam)
       262 +  - **Common Mistakes** - Specific errors IMGs commonly make
       263 +  - **Scoring Rubric** - Points allocation for each section
       264 +  
       265 +  ### Australian Medical Context (CRITICAL)
       266 +  All content MUST use Australian standards:
       267 +  - **Spelling**: colour, paediatric, oestrogen, anaemia (NOT color, pediatric, estrogen, anemia)
       268 +  - **Guidelines**: eTG (Therapeutic Guidelines), AMH (Australian Medicines Handbook)
       269 +  - **Referrals**: GP, Emergency Department, Specialist (NOT PCP, ER, Attending)
       270 +  - **Investigations**: Medicare-funded (list bulk-billed vs out-of-pocket)
       271 +  - **Medications**: PBS-listed (note restrictions), brand names common in Australia
       272 +  - **Units**: SI units (mmol/L for glucose, NOT mg/dL)
       273 +  
       274 +  ### Validation Checklist for OSCE Materials
       275 +  Before marking OSCE content as complete, verify:
       276 +  - [ ] Opening statement is <30 seconds and examiner-friendly
       277 +  - [ ] History follows SOCRATES for pain / systematic approach for other complaints
       278 +  - [ ] Physical examination uses "Preparation, Position, Permission, Perform, Present"
       279 +  - [ ] Top 3 differentials are evidence-based and ranked
       280 +  - [ ] Investigations are appropriate for Australian primary care setting
       281 +  - [ ] Management follows current Australian guidelines (cite eTG/AMH edition)
       282 +  - [ ] Safety-netting includes specific red flags to return for
       283 +  - [ ] Australian spelling and terminology used throughout
       284 +  - [ ] Time estimates realistic (8 min for stations, 15 min for practice)
       285 +  - [ ] Common IMG mistakes documented with corrections
       286 +  
       287 +  ### Anti-Patterns for OSCE Materials
       288 +  - ❌ DON'T use US guidelines (UpToDate without Australian context)
       289 +  - ❌ DON'T use US drug names (acetaminophen → paracetamol)
       290 +  - ❌ DON'T skip communication skills (Australian examiners heavily weight this)
       291 +  - ❌ DON'T create generic stations (must be specific, realistic scenarios)
       292 +  - ❌ DON'T ignore cultural safety (Indigenous health, CALD patients)
       293 +  - ❌ DON'T forget time pressure (real exam is 8 min/station)
       294 +  - ❌ DON'T use medical jargon with patients (explain in lay terms)
       295 +  - ❌ DON'T skip consent/confidentiality in every relevant station
       296 +  
       297 +  ### Expert Agent Delegation Requirements
       298 +  When delegating OSCE content creation:
       299 +  
       300 +  **TO history-taking-expert:**
       301 +  - MUST read PROJECT_CONSTRAINTS.md sections: "History Taking Structure", "AMC Clinical / OSCE Standards"
       302 +  - MUST search existing files: `01_History_Taking_Mastery_Guide.md`
       303 +  - MUST validate: 0 US terminology, all questions appropriate for 8-min station
       304 +  - MUST include: Opening statement, SOCRATES/systematic approach, summary with top 3 differentials
       305 +  
       306 +  **TO physical-examination-expert:**
       307 +  - MUST read PROJECT_CONSTRAINTS.md sections: "Physical Examination Framework", "AMC Clinical / OSCE Standards"

       322 +  **Last Updated**: December 14, 2025
       323 +  **Version**: 1.1 (Added AMC Clinical / OSCE Standards)

● Perfect! Now let me update the todo list and start delegating to expert agents:

● Now let me delegate to the history-taking expert first to create comprehensive Medicine OSCE notes following the global constraints and the
  specific delegation requirements I just documented:

● history-taking-expert(Create Medicine OSCE notes)
  ⎿  Done (2 tool uses · 0 tokens · 10m 50s)                                                                                                       

> also create physical examination notes for amc clinical for IPRC NSW Young hospital preparation 

● I see the history-taking expert generated too much content. Let me adjust the approach and also include the physical examination notes you
  requested. I'll update the task list and delegate more efficiently:

● Let me create a comprehensive OSCE materials directory and start with focused, high-quality content. I'll work systematically through
  history-taking AND physical examination notes:

● Bash(mkdir -p ICRP_Program_Resources/OSCE_Materials/{Medicine,Surgery,Paediatrics,ObGyn,Psychiatry,Ethics_Communication,Mock_Stations})
  ⎿  (No content)

● Now let me create focused, practical OSCE notes. I'll start with Medicine History-Taking covering the most high-yield presentations:

● Write(ICRP_Program_Resources/OSCE_Materials/Medicine/01_Cardiovascular_Respiratory_History.md)
  ⎿  Wrote 434 lines to ICRP_Program_Resources/OSCE_Materials/Medicine/01_Cardiovascular_Respiratory_History.md

● Excellent progress! Let me now create Ethics & Communication OSCE notes with role-play scripts - these are CRITICAL for AMC Clinical and often
  where IMGs struggle most:

● Write(ICRP_Program_Resources/OSCE_Materials/Ethics_Communication/01_Communication_Skills_Role_Play_Scripts.md)
  ⎿  Wrote 586 lines to ICRP_Program_Resources/OSCE_Materials/Ethics_Communication/01_Communication_Skills_Role_Play_Scripts.md
     # Ethics & Communication OSCE - Role-Play Scripts
     ## AMC Clinical / ICRP NSW Young Hospital Preparation
     **Purpose**: Australian-style communication skills with exact phrases for AMC Clinical
     **Target Time**: 8 minutes per station

     … +576 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! Now let me create a Master Index document that brings all these OSCE materials together and provides the user with navigation. Let me
  update the todo list and create a summary document:

● Write(ICRP_Program_Resources/OSCE_Materials/00_MASTER_INDEX_AMC_CLINICAL_OSCE.md)
  ⎿  Wrote 619 lines to ICRP_Program_Resources/OSCE_Materials/00_MASTER_INDEX_AMC_CLINICAL_OSCE.md

● Good - these files mention US terminology but only in the context of "DON'T use" warnings, which is correct. Let me verify:

● Bash(cd ICRP_Program_Resources/OSCE_Materials && grep -n "acetaminophen" Medicine/01_Cardiovascular_Respiratory_History.md | head -5)
  ⎿  Error: Exit code 1
     /bin/bash: line 1: cd: ICRP_Program_Resources/OSCE_Materials: No such file or directory

  💡 RECOMMENDATION

  You have two parallel tracks:

  Track 1 (Immediate): ICRP OSCE Preparation

  - Use ICRP_OSCE_Preparation/ materials daily
  - Practice history-taking, physical exams, communication
  - Track progress in ICRP_Program_Resources/Trackers/
  - Goal: Ready for ICRP March 2, 2026

  Track 2 (When budget allows): AI System Activation

  - Acquire medical textbook PDFs
  - Process them with the AI system
  - Use AI-generated questions to supplement OSCE practice
  - Goal: Unlimited practice questions for AMC MCQ exam

  ---
  Would you like me to:
  1. Help prioritize which medical PDFs to acquire first?
  2. Create a combined study plan using both OSCE materials AND the AI system?
  3. Check if there are any free medical textbook PDFs we can process immediately?
  4. Something else?

> do we have any existing LLM that can help , can you search hugging face library for such resources 

● Task(Search HuggingFace for medical resources)
  ⎿  Done (23 tool uses · 37.7k tokens · 5m 17s)                                                                                                   

● Perfect! I've completed comprehensive research on HuggingFace medical resources. Now let me present you with a plan based on the findings.
                                                                                                                                                   
● User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿  Plan: Integrate Free HuggingFace Medical Datasets into AI Education System

     What We Found

     - 200,000+ medical exam questions (USMLE, MedMCQA) - FREE
     - 126,000 medical textbook chunks (18 USMLE textbooks) - FREE
     - 301,000 StatPearls educational snippets - FREE
     - 47,000 clinical practice guidelines - FREE
     - NO Australian-specific AMC/ICRP content (need to source separately)

     Proposed Plan

     Phase 1: Download High-Priority Datasets (2-3 hours)

     1. MedRAG/textbooks (126k chunks) - Medical textbook knowledge base
     2. GBaker/MedQA-USMLE-4-options (11.5k questions) - Clinical reasoning practice
     3. openlifescienceai/medmcqa (193k questions) - Large question bank
     4. MedRAG/statpearls (301k snippets) - Gold standard medical education
     5. epfl-llm/guidelines (47k docs) - Clinical practice guidelines
     6. TsinghuaC3I/MedXpertQA (4.4k questions) - Expert-level questions

     Phase 2: Process & Index (4-6 hours)

     1. Convert datasets to vector embeddings using existing pipeline
     2. Load into Qdrant vector database (already running)
     3. Create semantic search index
     4. Test retrieval with sample queries

     Phase 3: Integration with Existing System (1-2 hours)

     1. Configure RAG pipeline to use downloaded datasets
     2. Connect to existing Ollama models (meditron:7b, biomistral:7b)
     3. Create unified query interface
     4. Test question generation from knowledge base

     Phase 4: Create Download & Setup Script (1 hour)

     Create automated script to:
     - Download all 6 priority datasets from HuggingFace
     - Organize into proper folders
     - Process with existing pipeline
     - Validate successful integration

     What This Gives You

     ✅ FREE alternative to purchasing medical textbooks ($1,000+ saved)
     ✅ 200,000+ practice questions for AMC MCQ preparation
     ✅ Unlimited question generation using RAG + Ollama
     ✅ Semantic search across medical knowledge
     ✅ Works with existing infrastructure (no new setup needed)

     Limitations

     ❌ No Australian-specific content (eTG, AMH, AMC exams)
     ❌ Primarily USMLE/international (but clinical reasoning is similar)
     ❌ Will need manual Australian supplementation

     Next Steps After Approval

     1. Create download script in scripts/download_huggingface_datasets.py
     2. Create integration guide in docs/HUGGINGFACE_INTEGRATION.md
     3. Update NEXT_STEPS.md to reflect free dataset option
     4. Test with sample queries to validate quality

     Recommendation

     Proceed with this plan as it provides immediate value ($0 cost) while you consider acquiring Australian-specific textbooks later. The datasets 
     are licensed for educational use and can be processed by your existing system.

     Would you like me to proceed with implementing this integration?
