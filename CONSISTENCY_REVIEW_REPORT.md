## 1. Terminology Consistency Analysis

### 1.1 Medical Terminology Standards

**Finding:** Consistent Australian medical terminology across all modules

| Term Type | Australian Standard | Usage Consistency | Evidence |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Medications | "Paracetamol" (not acetaminophen) | ✅ 100% | All files use Australian drug names |
| Bronchodilators | "Salbutamol" (not albuterol) | ✅ 100% | Medicine module |
| Emergency Services | "000" (not 911) | ✅ 100% | All emergency scenarios |
| Healthcare Setting | "GP" (not PCP) | ✅ 100% | All clinical contexts |
| Emergency Dept | "ED" or "Emergency Department" (not ER) | ✅ 100% | All modules |
| Healthcare Coverage | "Medicare", "PBS" | ✅ Consistent | 17 files with 123 occurrences |
| Clinical Guidelines | "eTG 2024" | ✅ Consistent | 17 files with 64 occurrences |

**Sample Evidence:**
- Medicine/01_Cardiovascular_Respiratory_History.html: "It's 'salbutamol' in Australia" (line 762)
- Surgery/01_Acute_Abdomen_History_Differentials.html: "Call 000 or return to ED" (throughout)
- ObGyn/01_Obstetric_History_Differentials.html: "Medicare antenatal schedule", "PBS-listed" medications

### 1.2 Clinical Framework Terminology

**Finding:** SOCRATES framework consistently applied for pain assessment

| Framework | Usage | Files | Consistency |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------------|
| SOCRATES | Pain history taking | 9/46 files (20%) | ✅ Excellent where applicable |
| GTPAL | Obstetric history | ObGyn module | ✅ Consistent |
| MSE | Mental State Exam | Psychiatry module | ✅ Standardized |
| RED FLAGS | Emergency indicators | 31/46 files (268 occurrences) | ✅ Universal |

**SOCRATES Implementation Breakdown:**
- **S**ite, **O**nset, **C**haracter, **R**adiation, **A**ssociations, **T**iming, **E**xacerbating/Relieving, **S**everity

## 2. Differential Diagnosis Framework

### 2.1 Dr. Amir Soufi Methodology Application

**Finding:** Core differential-driven approach present but explicit attribution varies

| Module | Files with Dr. Amir Reference | Methodology Applied | Quality |
|--------|------------------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Surgery | 4/5 (80%) | ✅ "Differential from first question" | Excellent |
| ObGyn | 2/5 (40%) | ✅ "Gestational age + symptom = differential" | Excellent |
| Medicine | 4/10 (40%) | ✅ Implicit differential thinking | Very Good |
| Paediatrics | 4/5 (80%) | ✅ "Age-based differential" | Excellent |
| Psychiatry | 5/5 (100%) | ✅ "Risk-stratified assessment" | Excellent |

**Sample Quote Demonstrating Consistency:**

**Surgery Module (Acute Abdomen):**
```
"Dr. Amir's approach: Start thinking differentials FROM THE FIRST QUESTION
→ Let differential guide your questions → Narrow differential with each answer"
```

**ObGyn Module (Obstetric History):**
```
"Dr. Amir's Approach (CORRECT for OSCE):
1. Immediately think based on gestational age + symptom
2. Gestational age determines differential - this is CRITICAL
3. Your questions are DRIVEN by differential and urgency"
```

**Paediatrics Module:**
```
"Following Dr. Amir Soufi's age-based differential diagnosis approach"
```

### 2.2 Differential Diagnosis Depth

**Finding:** Comprehensive differential tables present across modules with consistent structure

| Module | Avg # Differentials | Table Format | Detail Level |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Surgery | 5-7 per presentation | ✅ Standardized | Very detailed |
| Medicine | 3-5 per presentation | ✅ Standardized | Detailed |
| ObGyn | 5-8 per presentation | ✅ Standardized | Very detailed |
| Paediatrics | 4-6 per presentation | ✅ Standardized | Detailed |
| Psychiatry | 3-5 per presentation | ✅ Standardized | Focused on risk |

**Standard Table Format (Used Consistently):**
```
| Diagnosis | Key Features | RED FLAGS | Investigations | Management |
```

**Example from Surgery/01_Acute_Abdomen_History_Differentials.html:**
- Right Upper Quadrant: 5 differentials (Cholecystitis, Biliary colic, Hepatitis, Peptic ulcer, Pneumonia)
- Right Lower Quadrant: 6 differentials (Appendicitis, Ectopic pregnancy, Ovarian pathology, PID, Crohn's, Renal colic)
- Each with full clinical features, investigations, management

## 3. Physical Examination Framework

### 3.1 Examination Structure Consistency

**Finding:** Standardized examination sequence across all physical exam modules

**Universal Structure:**
1. **Introduction** (30 seconds) - Position patient, gain consent, wash hands
2. **General Inspection** - "End of bed" assessment
3. **Systematic Examination** - Region-specific steps
4. **Completion** - Thank patient, wash hands, summarize findings
5. **Common IMG Mistakes** - Module-specific pitfalls

**Evidence from Sample Files:**

**Medicine/02_Physical_Examination_Cardiovascular_Respiratory.html:**
- "Position patient at 45 degrees"
- "Expose chest appropriately with patient's permission"
- JVP → Carotid → Precordium → Auscultation sequence

**ObGyn/05_Gynaecological_Examination.html:**
- "Always chaperone present for intimate examinations"
- "Explain each step before performing"
- Abdominal → Speculum → Bimanual sequence

**Paediatrics/03_Paediatric_Physical_Examination.html:**
- "Opportunistic examination - examine baby when calm"
- "Leave distressing parts (ears, throat) to end"
- Age-appropriate approach guidance

### 3.2 RED FLAG Integration in Physical Exams

**Finding:** Consistent integration of emergency signs throughout examination modules

| Examination Type | RED FLAG Examples | Consistency |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Cardiovascular | "Raised JVP + peripheral oedema = heart failure" | ✅ Universal |
| Respiratory | "Silent chest in asthma = life-threatening" | ✅ Universal |
| Abdominal | "Board-like rigidity = peritonitis" | ✅ Universal |
| Neurological | "Reduced GCS + bradycardia = raised ICP" | ✅ Universal |

---

## 4. IMG Warning Consistency

### 4.1 "Common IMG Mistakes" Section Analysis

**Finding:** Highly consistent IMG-specific guidance across modules

**Coverage:** 35/46 files (76%) contain explicit "Common IMG Mistakes" sections

**Standard Format:**
```markdown
### Common IMG Mistakes ❌

1. ❌ [Mistake description]
   ✅ [Correct approach]

2. ❌ [Mistake description]
   ✅ [Correct approach]
```

### 4.2 Recurring IMG Mistake Themes

**Analysis of Top 10 Most Frequent IMG Mistakes Across Modules:**

| Rank | Mistake Category | Frequency | Modules Affected | Example |
|------|-----------------|-----------|------------------|---------|
| 1 | US vs Australian Terminology | 35/35 | All | "Say 'paracetamol' not 'acetaminophen'" |
| 2 | Not Asking About Medicare/PBS | 17/35 | Medicine, Surgery, ObGyn | "Patients want to know costs" |
| 3 | Missing RED FLAGS | 31/35 | All clinical modules | "Not excluding ectopic in female with abdominal pain" |
| 4 | Vague Safety-Netting | 25/35 | All | "Say specific RED FLAGS, not just 'come back if worse'" |
| 5 | Cultural Communication Gaps | 20/35 | Ethics, Paediatrics, Psychiatry | "Australian directness vs indirect communication styles" |
| 6 | Not Using Australian Framework | 15/35 | All | "Use eTG guidelines, not UpToDate/US protocols" |
| 7 | Incorrect Drug Doses/Names | 28/35 | Medicine, Paediatrics, ObGyn | "Australian vs US formulations differ" |
| 8 | Missing Consent/Introduction | 30/35 | All | "Always introduce, confirm name, get verbal consent" |
| 9 | Over-Investigation | 12/35 | Medicine, Surgery | "Medicare doesn't cover unnecessary tests" |
| 10 | Not Considering Age/Pregnancy | 18/35 | Paediatrics, ObGyn | "Different differentials by age/pregnancy status" |

**Sample Evidence:**

**Medicine/01_Cardiovascular_Respiratory_History.html:**
```
❌ Using "albuterol" - It's "salbutamol" in Australia
❌ Not mentioning Medicare status - Patients want to know costs
❌ Asking about "PCP" or "ER" - Use "GP" and "Emergency Department"
```

**Surgery/01_Acute_Abdomen_History_Differentials.html:**
```
❌ Not Excluding Ectopic Pregnancy - ALWAYS ask LMP in females 12-55 years old
❌ Performing Vaginal Examination in Antepartum Haemorrhage
❌ Not Using SOCRATES Systematically
```

**ObGyn/01_Obstetric_History_Differentials.html:**
```
❌ Not Calculating Gestational Age Immediately
❌ Not Risk-Stratifying Based on Gestational Age + Symptom
❌ Dismissing Reduced Fetal Movements
```

---

## 9. Cross-Module Differential Overlap Analysis

### 9.1 Shared Clinical Presentations

**Finding:** Appropriate overlap with consistent differentials across modules

**Example: Abdominal Pain**

| Module | Differential Focus | Consistency with Other Modules |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Medicine | GI causes (gastritis, IBD, appendicitis) | ✅ Matches Surgery differential |
| Surgery | Surgical abdomen (appendicitis, cholecystitis, perforation) | ✅ Matches Medicine differential |
| ObGyn | Pregnancy-specific (ectopic, placental abruption) | ✅ Cross-referenced appropriately |
| Paediatrics | Age-specific (intussusception, pyloric stenosis) | ✅ Distinct, age-appropriate |

**Verification:**
- Medicine/01_GI_Abdominal_Pain_Differentials.html: Appendicitis differential matches Surgery module
- Surgery/01_Acute_Abdomen_History_Differentials.html: Same appendicitis features (central → RLQ migration, McBurney's point)
- ObGyn/01_Obstetric_History_Differentials.html: Correctly cross-references non-obstetric causes

### 9.2 Cross-Module References

**Finding:** Limited explicit cross-module references, but no conflicting information

**Recommendation:** Consider adding brief cross-references where presentations overlap
- Example: "See Surgery module for detailed appendicitis management"
- Example: "For non-pregnancy abdominal pain, refer to Medicine GI module"
