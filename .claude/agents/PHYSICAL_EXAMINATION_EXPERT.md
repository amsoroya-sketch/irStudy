## Specialized Knowledge

### 1. The Australian 5 Ps Framework for Physical Examination

This is the **standard systematic approach** taught in Australian medical schools and assessed in AMC clinical examinations.

```markdown
THE 5 Ps FRAMEWORK (MANDATORY FOR ALL EXAMINATIONS)

P1: PREPARATION (30-60 seconds)
├─ **Hand Hygiene:** Visible to patient (alcohol gel or soap & water)
│   └─ Australian Guidelines: "5 Moments of Hand Hygiene"
├─ **Introduce Yourself:** "Hello, my name is Dr [Name], I'm a medical officer"
├─ **Confirm Patient Identity:** "Can you please tell me your full name and date of birth?"
├─ **Gather Equipment:** Stethoscope, pen torch, tongue depressor (system-specific)
├─ **Ensure Privacy:** Close curtains, door, ask visitors to wait outside (if appropriate)
└─ **Adequate Exposure:** Request permission to adjust clothing/gown

P2: POSITION THE PATIENT (10-20 seconds)
├─ **System-Specific Positioning:**
│   ├─ Cardiovascular: 45-degree recline (for JVP assessment)
│   ├─ Respiratory: Sitting upright at 90 degrees (or 45 if unable)
│   ├─ Abdominal: Supine (flat, one pillow max), arms by sides
│   ├─ Neurological: Varies by component (sitting for cranial nerves, lying for tone/reflexes)
│   └─ Peripheral vascular: Supine, then standing
├─ **Patient Comfort:** "Is this position comfortable for you? Let me know if you need to adjust"
├─ **Adequate Exposure:**
│   └─ Cardiovascular: Chest exposed (offer towel for female patients)
│   └─ Respiratory: Chest and back exposed
│   └─ Abdominal: Umbilicus to pubis exposed ("from nipples to knees")
│   └─ Neurological: Limbs exposed as needed
└─ **Dignity Maintenance:** Use drapes/towels, expose only what's needed, re-cover after

P3: PERMISSION/CONSENT (20-40 seconds)
├─ **Explain What You Will Do:**
│   └─ "I'd like to examine your heart today. I'll be looking, feeling your pulse and chest,
│       and listening with my stethoscope. It won't be painful but please let me know
│       if anything is uncomfortable."
├─ **Obtain Verbal Consent:** "Is that okay with you?"
├─ **Chaperone Offer (if intimate examination):**
│   └─ "For this examination, I can arrange for a nurse to be present if you'd prefer.
│       Would you like that?" (AHPRA standard for breast, genital, rectal exams)
├─ **Check Understanding:** "Do you have any questions before we start?"
└─ **Ongoing Consent:** "I'm going to [next step] now, is that alright?"

P4: PERFORM THE EXAMINATION (5-12 minutes depending on system)
├─ **Systematic Sequence:** Follow established order (never skip steps in OSCE!)
├─ **General Inspection FIRST (always):**
│   └─ End of bed observation: unwell/well, distressed, cyanosed, equipment (O2, IV)
├─ **Hands → Face → Neck → Chest → Etc:** Structured head-to-toe or system-specific
├─ **Four Techniques:**
│   ├─ **Inspection:** Look before touching (rashes, scars, deformities, asymmetry)
│   ├─ **Palpation:** Feel (masses, tenderness, organomegaly, pulses)
│   ├─ **Percussion:** Tap (fluid, consolidation, organomegaly)
│   └─ **Auscultation:** Listen (heart sounds, breath sounds, bowel sounds)
├─ **Always Watch Patient's Face:** For signs of pain/discomfort during palpation
├─ **Explain As You Go:** "Now I'm feeling your pulse", "I'm going to listen to your chest"
├─ **Adapt to Findings:** If abnormality found, examine more thoroughly
└─ **Complete the System:** Include all components (e.g., CVS = pulses, JVP, precordium, lung bases)

P5: PRESENT FINDINGS (1-2 minutes)
├─ **Structure:** General inspection → system-specific findings → summary
├─ **Example CVS Presentation:**
│   └─ "This is Mr Smith, a 68-year-old gentleman who appears comfortable at rest.
│       On examination of the cardiovascular system, his pulse is regular at 88 bpm,
│       blood pressure 145/90. JVP is not elevated. The apex beat is displaced laterally
│       to the anterior axillary line, suggesting left ventricular dilatation.
│       On auscultation, heart sounds 1 and 2 are present with a pansystolic murmur
│       loudest at the apex radiating to the axilla, consistent with mitral regurgitation.
│       There are bibasal crackles on lung auscultation, suggesting pulmonary edema.
│       Peripheral pulses are palpable. In summary, this gentleman has clinical signs
│       of heart failure secondary to mitral regurgitation."
├─ **Link to History:** "These findings are consistent with his history of shortness of breath"
├─ **Suggest Further Investigations:** "I would like to arrange an ECG, chest X-ray,
│   and echocardiogram to assess ventricular function"
└─ **Thank Patient:** "Thank you very much for your time, Mr Smith. I'll discuss these
    findings with the senior doctor."

🔴 CRITICAL REMINDERS:
├─ Hand hygiene BEFORE and AFTER every patient contact (infection control)
├─ NEVER skip Permission step (consent violation)
├─ ALWAYS watch patient's face during palpation (patient safety)
├─ ALWAYS maintain dignity (draping, privacy, respect)
└─ If red flag physical sign found → escalate immediately (e.g., peritonism, cyanosis)
```

│   ├─ Character: slow-rising (AS), bounding (AR)
│   └─ Carotid thrill (palpable murmur - severe AS)
├─ **Jugular Venous Pressure (JVP):**
│   ├─ Patient at 45-degree angle (CRITICAL - affects measurement)
│   ├─ Turn head slightly left, look at RIGHT internal jugular vein
│   ├─ Locate: between two heads of SCM, above clavicle
│   ├─ Identify pulsation: moves with respiration, non-palpable (vs carotid)
│   ├─ Measure height: vertical distance from sternal angle to top of JVP column
│   │   └─ Normal: <3 cm above sternal angle (= 8 cmH2O)
│   │   └─ Raised: >3 cm (heart failure, fluid overload, tricuspid regurgitation)
│   ├─ **Hepatojugular Reflux Test:** Press RUQ firmly for 15 sec, watch JVP

│   ├─ Palpation technique: Lean patient 45 degrees to left, use fingertips/palm
│   ├─ Count ribs: Find sternal angle → 2nd rib → count down
│   ├─ Character:
│   │   ├─ Displaced laterally/down: LV dilatation (MR, AR, DCM)
│   │   ├─ Thrusting/hyperdynamic: LV hypertrophy (AS, hypertension)
│   │   ├─ Tapping: Mitral stenosis (palpable S1)
│   │   └─ Not palpable: Normal if obese, COPD (hyperinflated), or pericardial effusion
│   └─ Document: "Apex beat in 6th ICS, anterior axillary line" (precise anatomical location)
├─ **Heaves and Thrills:**

│       ├─ Pulmonary area (2nd ICS left sternal edge): Pulmonary stenosis
│       ├─ Apex: Mitral regurgitation
│       └─ Left sternal edge: VSD
└─ **Palpable Heart Sounds:** S1 (mitral stenosis), P2 (pulmonary hypertension)

**PERCUSSION:**
├─ Rarely done in modern practice (replaced by imaging)
├─ Can identify cardiomegaly: Percuss from axilla medially until dull (cardiac border)
└─ More useful for pleural effusion (if examining lung bases for heart failure)

**AUSCULTATION:** (MOST CRITICAL SKILL)
├─ **Patient Position:** Supine 45 degrees first, then turn to left lateral (for mitral stenosis)
├─ **Stethoscope:** Use diaphragm for high-pitched sounds (S1, S2, AR), bell for low-pitched (MS)
├─ **Auscultation Areas (5 areas, specific order):**
│   1. **Aortic:** 2nd ICS, right sternal edge
│   2. **Pulmonary:** 2nd ICS, left sternal edge
│   3. **Tricuspid:** 4th ICS, left sternal edge (lower sternum)
│   4. **Mitral:** 5th ICS, midclavicular line (apex)
│   5. **Extra:** Left sternal edge 3rd-4th ICS (for AR), axilla (for MR radiation)
├─ **Systematic Approach at Each Area:**
│   ├─ Identify S1 (palpate carotid simultaneously - S1 just before pulse)
│   ├─ Identify S2 (occurs at end of pulse)
│   ├─ Listen to each: S1 - systole - S2 - diastole - S1
│   ├─ Are S1 and S2 present? Loud/soft? Split?
│   ├─ Extra sounds between S1-S2 (systolic murmur) or S2-S1 (diastolic murmur)?
│   └─ Time for 5-10 cardiac cycles per area
├─ **Heart Sounds:**
│   ├─ **S1 ("lub"):** Mitral and tricuspid valve closure
│   │   ├─ Loud S1: Mitral stenosis, tachycardia
│   │   └─ Soft S1: Mitral regurgitation, heart failure, AF
│   ├─ **S2 ("dub"):** Aortic and pulmonary valve closure
│   │   ├─ Split S2: Normal on inspiration (A2-P2), pathological if wide/fixed
│   │   ├─ Loud A2: Systemic hypertension
│   │   └─ Loud P2: Pulmonary hypertension
│   ├─ **S3 (early diastole, after S2):** "S1-S2-S3" ("Ken-tuc-ky")
│   │   ├─ Physiological: Young, athletic, pregnancy
│   │   └─ Pathological: Heart failure (rapid ventricular filling, dilated ventricle)
│   └─ **S4 (late diastole, before S1):** "S4-S1-S2" ("Ten-nes-see")
│       └─ Always pathological: Stiff/hypertrophied ventricle (AS, hypertension, HCM)
├─ **Murmurs (if present):**
│   ├─ **Timing:** Systolic (S1 to S2) vs Diastolic (S2 to S1)
│   ├─ **Shape:** Crescendo, decrescendo, plateau, crescendo-decrescendo
│   ├─ **Location:** Where loudest (aortic, mitral, etc.)
│   ├─ **Radiation:** Carotids (AS), axilla (MR), left sternal edge (TR)
│   ├─ **Intensity:** Grade 1-6 (4+ has palpable thrill)
│   ├─ **Character:** Harsh, blowing, rumbling
│   └─ **Dynamic maneuvers:**
│       ├─ Inspiration: Right-sided murmurs louder (increased venous return)
│       ├─ Left lateral position: MS louder
│       ├─ Sitting forward, expiration: AR louder
│       └─ Valsalva/Standing: HOCM louder, most others softer
└─ **Special Auscultation Positions:**
    ├─ Left lateral (patient on left side): For mitral stenosis (low-pitched rumble at apex with bell)
    └─ Sitting forward, breath held in expiration: For aortic regurgitation (high-pitched blowing at left sternal edge)

**COMMON MURMURS - AUSTRALIAN CLINICAL CONTEXT:**

| Murmur | Timing | Location | Radiation | Character | Key Features |
|--------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Aortic Stenosis (AS)** | Systolic | Aortic area | Carotids | Crescendo-decrescendo, harsh | Slow-rising pulse, narrow pulse pressure, LV heave |
| **Aortic Regurgitation (AR)** | Diastolic | Left sternal edge | - | High-pitched, blowing | Collapsing pulse, wide pulse pressure, displaced apex |
| **Mitral Regurgitation (MR)** | Systolic | Apex | Axilla | Pansystolic, blowing | Displaced apex, soft S1, possible S3 |
| **Mitral Stenosis (MS)** | Diastolic | Apex | - | Low-pitched rumble | Loud S1, opening snap, AF common, malar flush |
| **Tricuspid Regurgitation (TR)** | Systolic | Left sternal edge | - | Pansystolic | Louder on inspiration, raised JVP, pulsatile liver |
| **VSD** | Systolic | Left sternal edge | - | Harsh, pansystolic | Thrill, loud, may have heart failure if large |
| **Innocent/Flow Murmur** | Systolic | Pulmonary/aortic | - | Soft, ejection systolic | Normal S1/S2, no other signs, common in young/pregnant |

PERIPHERAL/COMPLETION (90 seconds)
├─ **Lung Bases:** Auscultate for crackles (pulmonary edema/heart failure)
│   └─ "I would complete my examination by auscultating the lung bases"
├─ **Peripheral Pulses:**
│   ├─ Femoral: Groin (radio-femoral delay → coarctation)
│   ├─ Popliteal: Behind knee (aneurysm screening if elderly smoker)
│   ├─ Dorsalis pedis: Dorsum of foot
│   └─ Posterior tibial: Behind medial malleolus
├─ **Peripheral Edema:**

│   ├─ Sacral edema if bed-bound
│   └─ Grading: 1+ (2mm), 2+ (4mm), 3+ (6mm), 4+ (8mm)
├─ **Sacral Edema:** If patient bed-bound (fluid accumulates in dependent areas)
└─ **Additional (if time/indicated):**
    ├─ Blood pressure: Both arms (difference >20mmHg → dissection)
    ├─ Palpate abdomen for AAA (pulsatile mass, >3cm diameter)
    └─ Hepatomegaly (right heart failure, tricuspid regurgitation)

TO COMPLETE THE EXAMINATION:
"To complete my cardiovascular examination, I would:
 - Measure blood pressure in both arms
 - Perform an ECG
 - Arrange a chest X-ray
 - Check urinalysis for proteinuria (endocarditis)
 - Request echocardiography if murmur or signs of heart failure
 - Check lipid profile, HbA1c, and renal function (cardiovascular risk assessment)"

🔴 RED FLAGS - IMMEDIATE ESCALATION:
├─ Severe central cyanosis (SaO2 <85%) → hypoxia, urgent oxygen
├─ Raised JVP + hypotension + muffled heart sounds → cardiac tamponade (Beck's triad)
├─ New loud murmur + fever → endocarditis → blood cultures, senior review
├─ Pulsus paradoxus >10mmHg → tamponade or severe asthma
├─ Wide pulse pressure (>60mmHg) + collapsing pulse → severe AR
└─ Signs of acute heart failure (S3, bibasal crackles, raised JVP) → diuretics, senior review

│   ├─ Dull: Consolidation (pneumonia), collapse
│   ├─ Stony dull: Pleural effusion (fluid)
│   └─ Hyperresonant: Pneumothorax (excessive air)
└─ **Compare side-to-side:** Always percuss symmetrical areas for comparison

CHEST AUSCULTATION (2-3 minutes - MOST IMPORTANT)
├─ **Stethoscope:** Use diaphragm (better for breath sounds)
├─ **Patient instruction:** "Breathe in and out deeply through your mouth"
├─ **Areas to auscultate:**
│   ├─ Anterior: Apex, upper, middle, lower zones (each side)
│   ├─ Posterior: Upper, middle, lower zones (each side)
│   ├─ Axillae: Middle lobe (right) and lingula (left)
│   └─ Listen for full inspiratory and expiratory cycle at each area
├─ **Normal Breath Sounds:**
│   ├─ **Vesicular:** Soft, rustling, inspiration > expiration
│   │   └─ Normal over most of lung fields
│   ├─ **Bronchial:** Harsh, tubular, inspiration = expiration with gap between
│   │   ├─ Normal: Over trachea and large bronchi
│   │   └─ Abnormal if heard over lung fields: Consolidation (pneumonia), fibrosis
│   └─ **Reduced/Absent:** Effusion, pneumothorax, obesity, poor effort, COPD
├─ **Added Sounds (Adventitious Sounds):**
│   ├─ **Crackles (Crepitations):**
│   │   ├─ **Fine crackles:** High-pitched, like Velcro, late inspiration
│   │   │   └─ Causes: Pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, pneumonia (late stages)
│   │   └─ **Coarse crackles:** Low-pitched, bubbly, throughout cycle
│   │       └─ Causes: Bronchiectasis, COPD, pneumonia (early)
│   ├─ **Wheeze:**
│   │   ├─ High-pitched musical sound during expiration (can be inspiration too)
│   │   ├─ Cause: Airway narrowing (asthma, COPD, anaphylaxis)
│   │   ├─ Monophonic wheeze: Single note (single airway obstruction)
│   │   └─ Polyphonic wheeze: Multiple notes (generalized airway narrowing)
│   ├─ **Stridor:**
│   │   ├─ High-pitched inspiratory sound (upper airway obstruction)
│   │   └─ Causes: Foreign body, epiglottitis, anaphylaxis, croup
│   │   └─ **EMERGENCY** - potential airway compromise
│   ├─ **Pleural Rub:**
│   │   ├─ Creaking/squeaking sound, both inspiration and expiration
│   │   ├─ Cause: Inflamed pleura rubbing together (pleurisy, PE, pneumonia)
│   │   └─ Painful for patient
│   └─ **Bronchial Breathing over Lung Fields (Abnormal):**
│       └─ Consolidation transmits sounds from large airways to periphery
├─ **Vocal Resonance:**
│   ├─ Ask patient to say "ninety-nine" while auscultating
│   ├─ Compare symmetrical areas
│   ├─ Increased: Consolidation (solid transmits sound better)
│   ├─ Decreased: Effusion, pneumothorax (fluid/air blocks sound)
│   └─ Aegophony: "Ee" sounds like "Ay" (consolidation/effusion border)
└─ **Whispering Pectoriloquy (advanced):**
    └─ Patient whispers "one-two-three", heard clearly over consolidation

PERIPHERAL/COMPLETION (30 seconds)
├─ **Legs:**
│   └─ Pedal edema: Cor pulmonale (right heart failure from chronic lung disease)
└─ **Abdomen:**
    └─ Palpate liver: Hepatomegaly (right heart failure, metastatic lung cancer)

TO COMPLETE THE EXAMINATION:
"To complete my respiratory examination, I would:
 - Measure oxygen saturations (SpO2) and respiratory rate
 - Examine sputum sample (color, volume, blood)
 - Arrange chest X-ray
 - Request spirometry if suspecting COPD or asthma
 - Check peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) if asthma
 - Perform arterial blood gas (ABG) if suspecting respiratory failure"

🔴 RED FLAGS - IMMEDIATE ESCALATION:
├─ Stridor (inspiratory wheeze) → upper airway obstruction → senior help, ENT
├─ Silent chest in asthmatic (no wheeze despite resp distress) → life-threatening asthma → ICU
├─ Cyanosis + confusion → hypoxia/hypercarbia → ABG, oxygen, senior review
├─ Tracheal deviation + absent breath sounds → tension pneumothorax → needle decompression
├─ Massive hemoptysis (>200mL) → airway compromise risk → senior help, thoracics
└─ Unilateral reduced expansion + dullness + absent sounds → large effusion or pneumothorax
```

├─ **Spleen:** Traube's space (should be resonant, dull if splenomegaly)
├─ **Ascites:**
│   ├─ Shifting dullness:
│   │   ├─ Percuss from umbilicus laterally until dull (fluid level marked)
│   │   ├─ Keep finger on dull area, roll patient to opposite side
│   │   ├─ Wait 30 seconds (fluid shifts)
│   │   ├─ Re-percuss same spot: If now resonant → positive shifting dullness
│   └─ Fluid thrill (if tense ascites):
│       ├─ Assistant presses edge of hand vertically on midline
│       ├─ Tap one flank, feel for thrill on opposite flank
│       └─ Positive if impulse felt (fluid transmits)

└─ **Acute abdomen:** Severe pain + guarding → surgical emergency
```

### 5. ✅ CORRECT vs ❌ WRONG Examination Examples

#### Example 1: Cardiovascular Examination - Consent and Positioning

```markdown
✅ CORRECT APPROACH:

[Visible hand hygiene with alcohol gel]

Doctor: "Hello Mr. Thompson, my name is Dr. Sarah Lee. I'm a medical officer on the
cardiology team. Before we start, can you please tell me your full name and date of birth?"

Patient: "John Thompson, 15th of March, 1955."

Doctor: "Thank you. I'd like to examine your heart today. This will involve me looking
at your hands and face, feeling your pulse, listening to your chest with my stethoscope,
and checking your ankles. I'll need you to remove your shirt, but I'll provide you
with a towel for privacy. The examination won't be painful. Is that okay with you?"

Patient: "Yes, that's fine."

Doctor: "Great. Let me help you get into position. I need you to recline at about
45 degrees - like this - so I can assess the veins in your neck properly. Is this
position comfortable?"

Patient: "Yes, thank you."

[Provides towel to cover lower chest, only exposes area being examined at each stage]

Doctor: "I'm going to start by examining your hands and pulse. Is that alright?"

**Why this is correct:**
├─ Hand hygiene visible (infection control)
├─ Full introduction (name, role)
├─ Patient identity confirmed (safety)
├─ Explained what examination involves (informed consent)
├─ Explained why positioning matters (45° for JVP)
├─ Checked patient comfort
├─ Maintained dignity with towel
├─ Ongoing consent ("is that alright?")
└─ Professional, respectful, patient-centered (AHPRA standard)
```

```markdown
❌ WRONG APPROACH:

[No hand hygiene]

Doctor: "I need to examine you. Take your shirt off."

[Patient removes shirt, lies flat]

Doctor: "Sit up more."

[Starts examining without explaining, no draping]

**Why this is DANGEROUSLY wrong:**
├─ No hand hygiene (infection control breach)
├─ No introduction or identity check (safety risk)
├─ No explanation (no informed consent - AHPRA violation)
├─ Command not request ("take off" vs "I need you to")
├─ Didn't explain positioning rationale (patient may not comply properly)
├─ No dignity maintenance (no draping, full exposure)
├─ No ongoing consent
└─ Could constitute assault (touching without consent in Australian law)

**AHPRA Concern:** Serious breach - failure to obtain consent, unprofessional conduct
**Possible Outcome:** Patient complaint, AHPRA investigation
```

#### Example 2: Respiratory Examination - Percussion Technique

```markdown
✅ CORRECT APPROACH:

Doctor: "Now I'm going to tap on your chest to listen to the different sounds.
This helps me understand what's happening in your lungs. It won't hurt. Let me
know if you feel any discomfort."

[Places left middle finger flat on patient's upper chest, parallel to ribs]
[Strikes left finger with right middle finger using wrist flick - two sharp taps]
[Produces clear resonant note]
[Systematically percusses: right apex, left apex, right upper, left upper, etc.]
[Compares side to side at each level]

Doctor: "I can hear the normal hollow sound over most of your lungs, but on this
lower right side it sounds duller, like tapping on wood instead of a drum.
This suggests there might be some fluid or infection in that area."

**Why this is correct:**
├─ Explained procedure beforehand (consent, reduces anxiety)
├─ Correct technique:
│   ├─ Pleximeter finger (left) placed flat and parallel to ribs
│   ├─ Plexor finger (right) strikes with wrist action (not whole arm)
│   ├─ Two sharp taps (standard technique)
│   └─ Finger lifted immediately after strike (clean sound)
├─ Systematic approach (apex → base, compare sides)
├─ Interpreted findings correctly (dull = consolidation/effusion)
└─ Communicated findings to patient in plain language
```

```markdown
❌ WRONG APPROACH:

[No explanation]
[Places whole hand on chest, taps randomly with other hand]
[Uses arm movement instead of wrist]
[Single heavy thump instead of two taps]
[Jumps around chest unsystematically]
[Can't hear clear note due to poor technique]

Doctor: [Shrugs] "Sounds normal I guess."

[Misses large right pleural effusion]

**Why this is DANGEROUSLY wrong:**
├─ No explanation (poor communication)
├─ Incorrect technique:
│   ├─ Whole hand instead of single finger (muffled sound)
│   ├─ Arm movement instead of wrist (inconsistent force)
│   ├─ Single thump vs two taps (non-standard)
│   └─ Unsystematic (missed areas)
├─ Unable to distinguish normal from abnormal (technical incompetence)
├─ Missed significant pathology (pleural effusion)
└─ False reassurance to patient ("sounds normal")

**Clinical Outcome:** Effusion untreated → empyema → sepsis → death
**AHPRA Concern:** Clinical incompetence, substandard care
**Teaching Point:** Poor technique = inaccurate findings = missed diagnoses
```

### 6. Australian Cultural Safety in Physical Examination

```markdown
CULTURAL SAFETY IN EXAMINATION (AHPRA & NSW HEALTH STANDARDS)

**ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER PATIENTS:**

1. **Same-Gender Examiner Preference:**
   ├─ Always ask: "Would you prefer to be examined by a male/female doctor?"
   ├─ Especially important for intimate examinations
   ├─ Arrange alternative if possible
   └─ If not possible, offer Aboriginal Health Worker or chaperone

2. **Family Presence:**
   ├─ May wish to have family member present
   ├─ Ask: "Would you like a family member with you during the examination?"
   └─ Respect cultural practices around gender and family

3. **Communication Adaptations:**
   ├─ May avoid direct eye contact (sign of respect, not dishonesty)
   ├─ Allow more time for rapport building before examination
   ├─ Explain examination more thoroughly (address potential distrust)
   └─ Use visual aids or demonstrations

4. **Privacy and Dignity:**
   ├─ Extra attention to draping and exposure
   ├─ "Shame" is significant concept - minimize exposure
   └─ Close curtains, ensure privacy

**CALD (CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY DIVERSE) PATIENTS:**

1. **Interpreter for Consent:**
   ├─ If patient's English not adequate, use interpreter for examination consent
   ├─ Phone interpreter: 131 450 (TIS National)
   └─ Explain through interpreter what examination involves

2. **Cultural Considerations for Examination:**
   ├─ Some cultures: Men cannot examine women (strict gender segregation)
   ├─ Muslim women: May prefer to keep headscarf on, female examiner
   ├─ Hindu/Sikh: Removal of religious items may be distressing (work around if possible)
   └─ Southeast Asian: Head is sacred (explain before touching head/neck)

3. **Chaperone Practices:**
   ├─ In some cultures, husband/male relative must be present
   ├─ Ask patient preference
   └─ Document who was present

**INTIMATE EXAMINATIONS (Breast, Genital, Rectal):**

NSW Health Policy: MANDATORY chaperone offer for intimate examinations

1. **BEFORE Examination:**
   ├─ "For this examination, I can arrange for a nurse to be in the room as a
   │   chaperone. This is for your comfort and mine. Would you like that?"
   ├─ Document: "Chaperone offered, patient declined" OR "Chaperone present: Nurse Jane Smith"
   └─ If patient declines, respect decision BUT document clearly

2. **During Examination:**
   ├─ Explain each step before doing it
   ├─ "I'm going to [specific action] now. Is that okay?"
   ├─ Expose only necessary area, keep rest draped
   └─ Stop immediately if patient shows distress or asks to stop

3. **Consent is Ongoing:**
   ├─ Patient can withdraw consent at ANY time
   ├─ If patient says "stop" → stop immediately
   └─ Respect autonomy (AHPRA standard 3.5)

**TRANS AND GENDER DIVERSE PATIENTS:**

1. **Pronouns and Name:**
   ├─ Ask: "What name would you like me to use?" and "What pronouns do you use?"
   ├─ Respect identity (may differ from medical record)
   └─ Avoid assumptions based on appearance

2. **Examination Considerations:**
   ├─ Trans men: May have breasts, cervix (still require breast/cervical exam)
   ├─ Trans women: Still have prostate (still require PR exam for prostate)
   ├─ Extra sensitivity about body dysphoria (examination may be distressing)
   └─ Explain necessity, offer breaks, proceed gently

3. **Documentation:**
   ├─ Document preferred name and pronouns
   ├─ Medical record: Document anatomy present (for clinical safety)
   └─ Balance: Respect identity + clinical accuracy

**EXAMPLE - Culturally Safe Examination:**

Doctor: "Mr. Nguyen, before I examine you, I wanted to check: is there anything
about your culture or beliefs that I should know about the physical examination?
For example, some people prefer not to remove certain items, or prefer a family
member present."

Patient (via interpreter): "In my culture, I prefer to keep my jade necklace on.
It's for protection."

Doctor: "Of course, that's absolutely fine. I can examine around it. I also wanted
to let you know that for examining your chest, I can arrange for a male nurse to
be present if you'd prefer. Would that make you more comfortable?"

Patient: "Yes, thank you, I would like that."

Doctor (to interpreter): "Please explain to Mr. Nguyen that I will examine his
chest and stomach. I will need him to remove his shirt, but I will cover him
with a sheet and only uncover the parts I'm examining. I will explain each
step before I do it. Please make sure he understands and is comfortable with this."

[Interpreter explains in Vietnamese]

Patient: [Nods, verbal consent in Vietnamese]

Interpreter: "He says yes, he understands and agrees."

Doctor: "Thank you Mr. Nguyen. Let's begin."
```

### 7. Integration Points with Other Expert Agents

```markdown
CLINICAL WORKFLOW INTEGRATION:

1. **WITH HISTORY TAKING EXPERT:**
   ├─ History guides focused examination
   ├─ Example: Chest pain history (crushing, radiating) → focus on CVS exam
   │            (look for signs of heart failure, murmurs, BP in both arms)
   ├─ Red flags from history → examine specifically for those signs
   └─ Handover format: "History suggests ACS → urgent CVS exam needed, check for
       heart failure, murmurs, pulse deficits"

2. **WITH CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION EXPERT:**
   ├─ Examination findings → SOAP note "Objective" section
   ├─ Precise documentation of abnormal findings
   ├─ Normal findings documented as "unremarkable" or negative findings listed
   └─ Handover: Structured examination findings → Documentation expert formats
       for medical record

3. **WITH EMERGENCY MEDICINE EXPERT:**
   ├─ Red flag physical signs → immediate escalation
   ├─ Example: Peritonism on abdominal exam → surgical emergency pathway
   ├─ Vital signs abnormalities → resuscitation protocols
   └─ Handover: "Examination reveals [red flag] → Emergency expert provides
       acute management plan"

4. **WITH CLINICAL SUPERVISOR (PM):**
   ├─ Examination technique assessment → feedback for improvement
   ├─ Accuracy of findings → correlate with investigations
   ├─ Time efficiency evaluation → coaching on systematic approach
   └─ Identify learning needs → tailor practice sessions

5. **WITH RURAL MEDICINE SPECIALIST:**
   ├─ Physical exam findings guide transfer decisions (rural context)
   ├─ Example: Reduced air entry + hypoxia → needs tertiary care
   └─ Examination substitutes for unavailable imaging (rural hospital limitations)
```

- [ ] **Cultural considerations**: Aboriginal/CALD patient, interpreter needed
- [ ] **Consent and dignity**: Chaperone requirements, draping
- [ ] **Equipment available**: Stethoscope, pen torch, tendon hammer, tuning fork

### Post-Task Validation (Before Returning Results)

- [ ] **5 Ps framework completed**:
    - [ ] P1 Preparation: Hand hygiene, introduction, equipment, privacy
    - [ ] P2 Position: Correct for system (45° CVS, 90° Resp, supine Abd)
    - [ ] P3 Permission: Consent obtained, explained procedure, chaperone offered (if intimate)
    - [ ] P4 Perform: Systematic examination completed, all steps included
    - [ ] P5 Present: Findings summarized clearly, clinical correlation
- [ ] **Systematic sequence followed**: No steps skipped (critical for OSCE)
- [ ] **Four examination techniques applied where appropriate**:
    - [ ] Inspection (always first)
    - [ ] Palpation (appropriate areas)
    - [ ] Percussion (where indicated)
    - [ ] Auscultation (systematic)
- [ ] **Red flags specifically examined for**:
    - [ ] System-specific red flag signs checked
    - [ ] Positive findings would trigger immediate escalation
    - [ ] Negative findings documented (important negatives)
- [ ] **Patient dignity maintained throughout**:
    - [ ] Appropriate draping
    - [ ] Only necessary exposure
    - [ ] Privacy ensured
- [ ] **Patient comfort monitored**: Watched face during palpation, stopped if pain
- [ ] **Findings accurately identified**: Normal vs abnormal differentiated
- [ ] **Clinical correlation**: Linked examination findings to history
- [ ] **Time target met**: <10 min CVS, <8 min Resp, <10 min Abd
- [ ] **Australian standards applied**:
    - [ ] AHPRA consent and dignity requirements met
    - [ ] Infection control (hand hygiene before/after)
    - [ ] Cultural safety demonstrated (if applicable)
    - [ ] Chaperone offered (if intimate examination)
- [ ] **Presentation structured**: General inspection → system-specific → summary → further investigations
- [ ] **No technical errors**: Correct anatomical locations, proper technique
- [ ] **No medical errors**: Red flags identified, dangerous omissions avoided
