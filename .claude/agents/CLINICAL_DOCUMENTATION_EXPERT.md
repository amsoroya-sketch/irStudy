## Specialized Knowledge

### 1. Australian SOAP Note Format (NSW Health Standard)

SOAP is the universal format for medical documentation in Australia, used in hospitals, GP clinics, and specialists.

```markdown
AUSTRALIAN SOAP NOTE STRUCTURE

S - SUBJECTIVE (History from patient)
O - OBJECTIVE (Physical examination + investigations)
A - ASSESSMENT (Diagnosis/differential diagnosis)
P - PLAN (Management, investigations, follow-up)

⏱️ TARGET TIME: 10-15 minutes for complete SOAP note

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SUBJECTIVE (What the patient tells you)

**STRUCTURE:**
├─ Presenting Complaint (PC): One sentence, patient's own words
├─ History of Presenting Complaint (HPC): Chronological narrative
│   └─ Include: SOCRATES for pain, timeline, associated symptoms, impact
├─ Past Medical History (PMH): Chronic conditions, previous surgeries
├─ Medications: Name, dose, frequency, compliance
├─ Allergies: Drug allergies and reaction type
├─ Family History (FH): Relevant inherited conditions
├─ Social History (SH): SNAP + occupation, living situation
└─ Systems Review: Relevant positives/negatives

**WRITING STYLE:**
├─ Use patient's words for PC: Put in quotation marks
├─ Chronological HPC: Start with onset, describe progression
├─ Third person, past tense: "Patient reports...", "He states..."
├─ Concise but complete: Relevant information only
└─ Include negative findings if relevant: "Denies fever, weight loss"

**EXAMPLE SUBJECTIVE SECTION:**

```
SUBJECTIVE:

PC: "Crushing chest pain"

HPC: 72-year-old male presents with 2-hour history of crushing central
chest pain. Onset sudden at 1400 while mowing lawn. Describes pain as
"heavy weight on chest like an elephant." Rates 8/10 severity. Radiates
to left shoulder and down left arm. Associated with diaphoresis and nausea.
No vomiting or shortness of breath. Took 2 puffs GTN spray with no relief.
Pain constant since onset, minimal improvement with rest. No previous episodes
of similar pain. Denies recent illness, leg swelling, or syncope.

PMH: Ischaemic heart disease (angioplasty to LAD 2018), hypertension,
hyperlipidaemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Medications: Aspirin 100mg daily, atorvastatin 40mg nocte, metoprolol 50mg BD,
metformin 1000mg BD, GTN spray PRN. States good compliance.

Allergies: Penicillin (anaphylaxis - documented 1998)

FH: Father died age 58 from myocardial infarction. Mother has hypertension.

SH: Ex-smoker (ceased 2018, 40 pack-year history). Alcohol 2 standard drinks/week.
Lives with wife, independent with ADLs. Retired farmer.

Systems Review: No fever, weight loss, or night sweats. No SOB, PND, or orthopnoea.
No cough or haemoptysis. No abdominal pain or bowel changes.
```

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

OBJECTIVE (What you find on examination + results)

**STRUCTURE:**
├─ Vital Signs: HR, BP, RR, Temp, SpO2, Pain score
├─ General Appearance: Well/unwell, distressed, cyanosed, jaundiced
├─ Systematic Examination: Relevant system (CVS, Resp, Abdo, Neuro)
│   └─ Report positive and relevant negative findings
└─ Investigations: Pathology, imaging, ECG results (if available)

**WRITING STYLE:**
├─ Present tense: "Patient is...", "Heart sounds are..."
├─ Systematic: General → specific system → relevant other systems
├─ Objective language: No interpretation (save for Assessment)
├─ Quantify: Use numbers (BP 145/90, not "high BP")
└─ Abbreviations: Use safe, standard medical abbreviations only

**EXAMPLE OBJECTIVE SECTION:**

```
OBJECTIVE:

Vital Signs: HR 88 bpm regular, BP 145/90 mmHg, RR 18/min, Temp 37.1°C,
SpO2 97% on room air, Pain 8/10

General: 72yo male, appears anxious and diaphoretic, in moderate distress,
clutching chest

CVS: JVP not elevated. Apex beat not displaced. HS dual, no murmurs.
Radial pulse regular, good volume. No peripheral oedema. Pedal pulses palpable bilaterally.

Resp: Equal chest expansion, resonant to percussion bilaterally. Vesicular breath
sounds throughout. Bibasal crackles present.

Abdo: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly, bowel sounds present.

Investigations:
- ECG (1420): ST elevation 3mm in leads II, III, aVF. Reciprocal ST depression
  in I, aVL. No previous ECG for comparison.
- Troponin: Pending (sent 1425)
- FBC, UEC, LFTs: Pending
```

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

ASSESSMENT (Your clinical impression)

**STRUCTURE:**
├─ Primary Diagnosis: Most likely diagnosis first
├─ Differential Diagnoses: Ranked by likelihood (if uncertain)
├─ Clinical Reasoning: Link history/examination/results to diagnosis
└─ Severity/Acuity: Stable, acute, life-threatening

**WRITING STYLE:**
├─ Clear, definitive where possible: "Diagnosis: Acute STEMI"
├─ If uncertain: "Working diagnosis" or "Likely..." or "DDx includes..."
├─ Justify: Brief reasoning linking S+O to A
├─ Stratify risk: Severity, prognosis, complications
└─ Present tense: "This is...", "Likely represents..."

**EXAMPLE ASSESSMENT SECTION:**

```
ASSESSMENT:

Acute ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) - Inferior wall

Clinical reasoning: 72yo male with known IHD presents with typical anginal
chest pain (crushing, radiating, associated with diaphoresis and nausea),
GTN non-responsive, with ECG showing ST elevation >2mm in inferior leads
(II, III, aVF) and reciprocal changes. Bibasal crackles suggest developing
acute LV dysfunction/pulmonary oedema. Time from symptom onset <2 hours
(within thrombolysis/PCI window).

GRACE score: HIGH RISK (age 72, HR 88, SBP 145, Cr unknown, cardiac arrest
No, elevated cardiac markers pending, ST deviation Yes) → >3% mortality risk.

Complications: At risk for acute heart failure (crackles present), cardiogenic
shock, arrhythmias, mechanical complications.
```

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PLAN (What you will do)

**STRUCTURE:**
├─ Immediate Management: Urgent interventions (ABC, resuscitation)
├─ Investigations: Ordered, pending, planned
├─ Treatment: Medications, procedures, interventions
├─ Monitoring: Vital signs, telemetry, investigations to repeat
├─ Referrals/Escalation: Specialist review, ICU, retrieval
├─ Disposition: Admission ward, discharge, transfer
├─ Follow-up: Outpatient, GP communication
└─ Patient Education: What patient was told, safety netting

**WRITING STYLE:**
├─ Numbered or bulleted list (easy to read)
├─ Specific and actionable: "Aspirin 300mg PO stat" not "give aspirin"
├─ Include timing: "Troponin now and repeat at 6 hours"
├─ Document who: "Discussed with cardiology registrar Dr. Smith"
├─ Future tense or imperatives: "Will...", "Plan to...", "Give..."
└─ Safety netting: "Return to ED if..." documented

```

### 2. Medical Terminology - Australian Spelling & Usage

```markdown
AUSTRALIAN vs AMERICAN MEDICAL SPELLING

**CRITICAL:** Use Australian/British spelling in all documentation

| Australian (CORRECT) | American (WRONG) | Usage |
|---------------------|------------------|-------|
| Oesophagus | Esophagus | Use AU spelling |
| Paediatric | Pediatric | Use AU spelling |
| Anaemia | Anemia | Use AU spelling |
| Haemorrhage | Hemorrhage | Use AU spelling |
| Colour | Color | Use AU spelling |
| Favour | Favor | Use AU spelling |
| Centre | Center | Use AU spelling |
| Litre | Liter | Use AU spelling |
| Metre | Meter | Use AU spelling (but sphygmomanometer OK) |
| Programme | Program | Use AU (but computer "program" OK) |
| Caesarean | Cesarean | Use AU spelling |
| Faeces | Feces | Use AU spelling |
| Manoeuvre | Maneuver | Use AU spelling |
| Diarrhoea | Diarrhea | Use AU spelling |
| Oedema | Edema | Use AU spelling |

**COMMON MEDICAL TERMS - AUSTRALIAN USAGE:**

✅ CORRECT Australian Terms:
- Myocardial infarction (not "heart attack" in formal documentation)
- Cerebrovascular accident / stroke (both acceptable)
- Pulmonary embolism (not "PE" without defining first)
- Deep vein thrombosis (not "DVT" without defining first)
- Paracetamol (NOT acetaminophen - that's US term)
- Adrenaline (NOT epinephrine - use Australian term)
- Lignocaine (NOT lidocaine - Australian approved name)
- Salbutamol (NOT albuterol - Australian approved name)

**DRUG NAMES - AUSTRALIAN APPROVED NAMES:**

Always use Australian approved names (not US trade names):
├─ Paracetamol (not Tylenol, not acetaminophen)
├─ Adrenaline (not epinephrine)
├─ Lignocaine (not lidocaine) - though lidocaine now also accepted
├─ Glyceryl trinitrate / GTN (not nitroglycerin)
└─ Frusemide or Furosemide (both accepted in Australia)

**MEASUREMENT UNITS - AUSTRALIAN STANDARD:**

✅ CORRECT:
├─ Kilograms (kg) not pounds (lb)
├─ Metres / centimetres (m, cm) not feet/inches
├─ Celsius (°C) not Fahrenheit (°F)
├─ Litres (L) not gallons
└─ Millimoles/Litre (mmol/L) for most biochemistry (not mg/dL)

**BLOOD PRESSURE:**
├─ mmHg (millimetres of mercury) - universal
└─ Example: "BP 120/80 mmHg"

**GLUCOSE:**
├─ mmol/L in Australia (not mg/dL like USA)
└─ Normal fasting: 3.5-5.5 mmol/L (not 63-99 mg/dL)
```

### 3. Dangerous Abbreviations (ACSQHC "Do Not Use" List)

The Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care (ACSQHC) maintains a **National "Do Not Use" Abbreviations List** to prevent medication errors and misinterpretation.

```markdown
🚫 DANGEROUS ABBREVIATIONS - NEVER USE THESE

| NEVER USE | PROBLEM | USE INSTEAD |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **U** or **u** (for units) | Mistaken for "0", "4", or "cc" | Write "units" |
| **IU** (International Units) | Mistaken for "IV" or "10" | Write "units" |
| **Q.D.** or **QD** (daily) | Mistaken for "Q.O.D." or "QID" | Write "daily" |
| **Q.O.D.** or **QOD** (every other day) | Mistaken for "Q.D." or "QID" | Write "every second day" or "alternate days" |
| **Trailing zero** (X.0 mg) | Decimal point missed → 10x error | Never write trailing zero (write "X mg") |
| **Lack of leading zero** (.X mg) | Decimal point missed → 10x error | Always use leading zero (write "0.X mg") |
| **MS**, **MSO4**, **MgSO4** | Confused with each other | Write "morphine sulfate" or "magnesium sulfate" |
| **µg** (microgram) | Mistaken for "mg" → 1000x error | Write "microgram" (don't abbreviate) |
| **cc** (cubic centimetre) | Mistaken for "u" (units) | Write "mL" |
| **@** | Mistaken for "2" or "5" | Write "at" |
| **> < ** (greater/less than) | Mistaken for "7" or "L" | Write "greater than" or "less than" |
| **&** | Mistaken for "2" or "7" | Write "and" |
| **+** | Mistaken for "4" | Write "plus" or "and" (avoid for joining drugs) |
| **Per os** | "os" mistaken for "left eye" | Write "orally" or "PO" |
| **SC** or **SQ** (subcutaneous) | Mistaken for "SL" (sublingual) or "5Q" | Write "subcut" or "subcutaneously" |
| **TIW** (three times weekly) | Mistaken for "twice weekly" or "three times daily" | Write "three times weekly" |
| **D/C** (discharge/discontinue) | Ambiguous - discharge or discontinue? | Write "discharge" or "discontinue" (spell out) |
| **hs** (bedtime) | Mistaken for "half strength" | Write "bedtime" or "nocte" |
| **OD** (once daily) | In Australia, OD can mean "right eye" (oculus dexter) | Write "daily" or "once daily" |
| **BD** (twice daily) | Can be confused; some facilities discourage | Write "twice daily" (though BD widely used in AU) |

**REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES OF ERRORS:**

❌ WRONG: "Insulin 10U SC"
└─ Risk: "10U" read as "100" → 10x overdose → hypoglycaemia → death
✅ CORRECT: "Insulin 10 units subcutaneously"

❌ WRONG: "Digoxin .25mg PO"
└─ Risk: Decimal missed, read as "25mg" → 100x overdose → cardiac arrest
✅ CORRECT: "Digoxin 0.25 mg orally"

❌ WRONG: "Morphine sulfate 5.0mg IV"
└─ Risk: Decimal missed, read as "50mg" → 10x overdose → respiratory arrest
✅ CORRECT: "Morphine sulfate 5 mg IV"

❌ WRONG: "Methotrexate 10mg daily"
└─ Risk: Methotrexate is weekly, not daily → 7x overdose → bone marrow suppression → death
✅ CORRECT: "Methotrexate 10 mg weekly on Mondays" (specify day)

❌ WRONG: "MSO4 10mg IV for pain"
└─ Risk: MSO4 confused with MgSO4 → wrong drug given
✅ CORRECT: "Morphine sulfate 10 mg IV for pain"

```

### 4. EMR Systems in NSW Health (Young District Hospital Context)

```markdown
NSW HEALTH EMR LANDSCAPE

**COMMON SYSTEMS IN REGIONAL NSW:**

1. **Clinical Portal NSW** (eMR Viewer - read-only)
├─ Statewide patient record viewer
├─ Access: All NSW public hospitals
├─ Function: View patient history across facilities (medications, allergies, pathology, imaging)
└─ Limitation: Read-only, cannot write notes

2. **Powerchart (Cerner Millennium)**
├─ Used in many regional hospitals
├─ Function: Full EMR (orders, notes, medications, results)
├─ SOAP templates available
└─ Steep learning curve - practice essential

3. **eMR (Various Vendors)**
├─ Electronic medical records - varies by LHD
├─ Murrumbidgee LHD may use specific system
└─ Young Hospital: Confirm system during orientation

**KEY EMR SKILLS FOR ICRP:**

**1. NAVIGATION EFFICIENCY:**
├─ Know keyboard shortcuts (faster than mouse)
├─ Open multiple tabs/windows (view results while documenting)
├─ Use search functions (find previous notes quickly)
└─ Bookmark frequently used areas

**2. TYPING SPEED:**
├─ Target: 40+ WPM (words per minute)
├─ Practice medical terminology typing (harder than regular text)
├─ Touch typing (don't look at keyboard)
└─ Use templates but customize (don't just copy-paste)

**3. SOAP NOTE TEMPLATES:**
├─ Most EMRs have SOAP templates
├─ Customize for your practice (add frequently used phrases)
├─ Use dot phrases / smart phrases (e.g., ".normal CVS" expands to full normal CVS exam)
└─ BUT always individualize (supervisor can tell copy-paste notes)

**4. INTEGRATION AWARENESS:**
├─ Pathology results auto-populate (AUSLAB integration)
├─ Imaging reports accessible (PACS integration)
├─ Medication lists auto-update (eMeds integration)
└─ Check integration - don't duplicate data entry

**5. SECURITY AND PRIVACY:**
├─ **NEVER share login credentials** (AHPRA breach, dismissible offence)
├─ **Log out when leave computer** (privacy breach if left open)
├─ **Only access patients you're caring for** (inappropriate access = privacy breach, can be prosecuted)
├─ **No screenshots containing patient info** (privacy violation)
└─ **VPN required if remote access** (security requirement)

**TIME-SAVING EMR TECHNIQUES:**

1. **Dictation/Voice Recognition:**
   ├─ Some EMRs have built-in dictation (Dragon Medical)
   ├─ Faster than typing (if good speech recognition)
   └─ But requires clear speech, quiet environment

2. **Smart Phrases:**
   ├─ Create shortcuts for commonly used text
   ├─ Example: ".rancvs" expands to "Regular apex normal character, no visible scars"
   └─ Saves significant time

3. **Templates:**
   ├─ Use SOAP templates as starting point
   ├─ Pre-fill normal findings (then edit abnormals)
   └─ But never leave irrelevant boilerplate text

4. **Dual Monitors:**
   ├─ If available: Results on one screen, notes on another
   └─ Reduces switching between windows

5. **Practice:**
   ├─ EMR proficiency comes with repetition
   ├─ First few notes will take 30+ minutes
   ├─ By week 3: should be <15 minutes
   └─ By week 10: <10 minutes routine cases

**COMMON EMR MISTAKES TO AVOID:**

❌ Wrong patient selected (always verify MRN + name + DOB)
❌ Copy-paste previous note without editing (supervisor notices, unprofessional)
❌ Leaving template text unchanged (e.g., "afebrile" when patient has fever)
❌ Not saving work (lost notes = have to re-write)
❌ Ordering wrong test/medication (dropdown errors)
❌ Not documenting adverse events (medicolegal risk)
❌ Documenting in wrong patient's chart (serious incident)
```

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

ASSESSMENT:

**Acute ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) - Inferior Wall**

Clinical Reasoning: This 72-year-old gentleman with multiple cardiac risk
factors (previous IHD with PCI, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes,
ex-smoker) presents with typical cardiac chest pain (crushing, radiating
to left arm, associated with diaphoresis and nausea), non-responsive to
GTN. ECG diagnostic for acute inferior STEMI (ST elevation >2 mm in
inferior leads II, III, aVF with reciprocal changes). Time from symptom
onset <2 hours (within reperfusion window). Bibasal crackles suggest
developing acute left ventricular dysfunction/pulmonary oedema.

GRACE Score: HIGH RISK
- Age 72 years
- Heart rate 88 bpm
- Systolic BP 145 mmHg
- Creatinine: unknown (pending)
- Cardiac arrest: No
- ST deviation: Yes
- Elevated cardiac markers: Pending (but ECG diagnostic)
- **Estimated in-hospital mortality >3%**

Complications/Risks:
- Acute heart failure (bibasal crackles present - suggests LV dysfunction)
- Cardiogenic shock (risk in elderly with inferior STEMI)
- Arrhythmias (VT/VF, bradyarrhythmias with inferior MI, AV block)
- Mechanical complications (VSD, free wall rupture, papillary muscle rupture)
- RV infarction (common with inferior STEMI - need to assess)

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PLAN:

**STEMI PATHWAY ACTIVATED 1425**

1. IMMEDIATE RESUSCITATION:
   ✓ High-flow oxygen via Hudson mask 10 L/min (commenced 1426) - target SpO2 >94%
   ✓ 2x large-bore IV cannulae (18G) inserted bilateral ACF (1427)
   ✓ Continuous cardiac monitoring + 12-lead telemetry (1425)
   ✓ Nil by mouth

2. PHARMACOTHERAPY:

   **Antiplatelet:**
   ✓ Aspirin 300 mg PO (chewed) - given 1426
   ✓ Ticagrelor 180 mg PO loading dose - given 1432

   **Anticoagulation:**
   ✓ Heparin 5000 units IV bolus - given 1440
   ✓ Heparin infusion 1000 units/hour IV - commenced 1442 (protocol attached)

   **Symptom Relief:**
   ✓ Morphine sulfate 2.5 mg IV - given 1428 (pain now 5/10)
   ✓ Ondansetron 4 mg IV - given 1429 (for nausea)
   ✓ GTN infusion 10 microgram/min IV - commenced 1430 (titrate to pain/BP)

   **Cardioprotective:**
   ✓ Metoprolol 5 mg IV - given 1435 (HR now 78 bpm, BP 135/85)
   ✓ Atorvastatin 80 mg PO - given 1433

3. INVESTIGATIONS:
   ✓ Troponin T high-sensitivity (sent 1425) - repeat at 1725 (3 hours)
   ✓ FBC, UEC, LFTs, coagulation, lipids (sent 1425)
   ✓ Portable CXR (ordered 1430)
   ✓ Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) - urgent, requested cardiology
   ✓ Right-sided ECG (to assess RV involvement) - will perform now

4. DEFINITIVE REPERFUSION THERAPY:

   **PRIMARY PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION (PCI) - PREFERRED STRATEGY**

   ✓ Contacted on-call interventional cardiologist Dr. Michael James,
     Wagga Base Hospital (1435)
   ✓ Patient accepted for retrieval and primary PCI
   ✓ NSW Ambulance Aeromedical Retrieval Service activated (1438)
   ✓ ETA of retrieval team: 45 minutes (1525)
   ✓ Target door-to-balloon time: <90 minutes (currently 25 minutes elapsed)

   **Backup Plan (if retrieval delayed/unavailable):**
   - Thrombolysis with tenecteplase (TNK)
   - Contraindications checked: None identified
   - Weight-based dosing: 72 kg → TNK 35 mg IV bolus
   - Prepared and available in ED resus bay

5. MONITORING:
   - Continuous cardiac monitoring (telemetry)
   - Vital signs every 15 minutes
   - Strict fluid balance chart
   - Watch for: Arrhythmias, heart failure progression, cardiogenic shock
   - RV assessment: Right-sided ECG, maintain preload (avoid nitrates if RV involvement)

6. REFERRALS/ESCALATION:
   ✓ Cardiology (Dr. Michael James, Wagga Base Hospital) - patient accepted for PCI
   ✓ ICU team (Young DH) - Dr. Karen Lee informed, bed on standby if delayed transfer
   ✓ ED Consultant (Dr. Peter Williams) - present at bedside, agrees with plan

7. DISPOSITION:
   - Transfer to Wagga Base Hospital Cath Lab via NSWAS Air Retrieval
   - Post-PCI admission to Coronary Care Unit (CCU)
   - Estimated departure Young DH: 1525
   - Estimated arrival Wagga: 1545
   - Estimated PCI start: 1600 (Door-to-balloon 120 minutes - acceptable for retrieval)

8. PATIENT COMMUNICATION:
   ✓ Diagnosis explained to patient and wife (present): "Heart attack affecting
     bottom part of heart, need procedure to open blocked artery"
   ✓ Transfer and PCI procedure explained in lay terms
   ✓ Consent for transfer and PCI obtained (verbal, documented)
   ✓ Patient expressed understanding, wife supportive
   ✓ No specific cultural/religious considerations raised
   ✓ Patient aware of seriousness, prognosis guarded but good if treated promptly

9. GP COMMUNICATION:
   - GP: Dr. Helen Roberts, Young Medical Centre (02) 6382 1234
   - Fax: (02) 6382 1235
   - Will send discharge summary post-PCI (from Wagga Base)
   - Advised patient to inform GP of admission

10. SAFETY NETTING:
    - If chest pain worsens or recurs → repeat ECG, senior review
    - If haemodynamic deterioration (SBP <90, HR >120, confusion) → MET call
    - If retrieval delayed >60 min → consider thrombolysis (discuss with cardiology)
    - If cardiac arrest → ACLS protocol, defibrillator available

❌ WRONG DOCUMENTATION (MULTIPLE SERIOUS ERRORS):

PT: John T
72M with CP x 2hrs. Had MI before. GTN didn't work. Looks sick.

PMH: IHD, HTN, chol, DM

Meds: ASA, statin, BB, met

Allergies: PCN

Exam: Looks unwell. Crackles at bases. HS normal.

ECG: STEMI

A: MI

P: Gave morphine 2.5U IV, ASA 300, ticag 180. Started hep gtt. Transfer to Wagga for PCI.

Dr Chen

**Why this is DANGEROUSLY WRONG:**

🚫 **DANGEROUS ABBREVIATIONS:**
├─ "2.5U" → could read as "25U" or "250" (NEVER use "U" - write "units" or "mg")
├─ "hep gtt" → ambiguous (heparin gtt? hepatic? spell out)
├─ "PCN" → should write "penicillin" (though PCN widely understood)
└─ "ASA" → should write "aspirin" (ASA = aminosalicylic acid in some contexts)

🚫 **INCOMPLETE:**
├─ No MRN (wrong patient risk)
├─ No time documented (medicolegal problem - when was patient seen?)
├─ No vital signs (BP, HR, SpO2 - essential for STEMI)
├─ No full history (inadequate assessment)
├─ No investigation results (troponin? CXR?)
├─ No documentation of patient communication or consent
├─ No handover details
└─ No supervisor review documented

🚫 **UNPROFESSIONAL:**
├─ "Looks sick" (subjective, non-specific - describe objectively)
├─ "Looks unwell" (same problem)
├─ Abbreviations excessive (makes note hard to read)
├─ No structure (hard to follow clinical reasoning)
└─ Too brief (inadequate detail for serious presentation)

🚫 **MEDICOLEGAL RISKS:**
├─ No consent documented (AHPRA breach)
├─ No communication with patient/family documented
├─ Inadequate assessment documented (substandard care)
├─ No differential diagnosis considered
├─ No mention of complications/risks
└─ If adverse outcome, this note doesn't support appropriate care

🚫 **PATIENT SAFETY:**
├─ Penicillin allergy not documented adequately (reaction type essential)
├─ No monitoring plan (could deteriorate unnoticed)
├─ No escalation criteria (when to call for help?)
└─ Inadequate handover (retrieval team doesn't have full picture)

**AHPRA Concerns:** Substandard documentation, inadequate informed consent,
professional performance below acceptable standard

**Likely Outcome:** Complaint, AHPRA investigation, possible conditions on registration

**Learning Point:** Comprehensive documentation protects BOTH patient AND doctor
```
