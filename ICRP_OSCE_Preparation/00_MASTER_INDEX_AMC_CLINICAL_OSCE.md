## <a name="common-mistakes"></a>COMMON IMG MISTAKES (Avoid These!)

### ❌ TOP 10 MISTAKES IN AMC CLINICAL

1. **❌ Not introducing yourself or washing hands**
   - ALWAYS start every station: "Hello, I'm Dr [Name]." + Hand hygiene

2. **❌ Using US terminology**
   - Say: paracetamol, GP, Emergency Department, salbutamol
   - NOT: acetaminophen, PCP, ER, albuterol

3. **❌ Forgetting Australian spelling**
   - paediatric, anaemia, oestrogen, colour (NOT pediatric, anemia, estrogen, color)

4. **❌ Not checking understanding**
   - ALWAYS say: "Does that make sense?" "Do you have any questions?"

5. **❌ No safety-netting**
   - ALWAYS give specific red flags: "If you develop [X, Y, Z], call 000 or go to ED."

6. **❌ Poor time management**
   - Stations are 8 minutes STRICT - practice with timer
   - Have a watch visible during exam

7. **❌ Not offering chaperone**
   - For any intimate examination, ALWAYS offer chaperone

8. **❌ Inadequate exposure for examination**
   - Can't examine through clothing
   - MUST expose adequately (while maintaining dignity)

9. **❌ Talking to interpreter instead of patient**
   - ALWAYS look at patient, speak TO patient (not ABOUT patient to interpreter)

10. **❌ No empathy in communication stations**
    - MUST show empathy: "I can see this is difficult." "I'm sorry you're going through this."

### Additional Mistakes by System

**History-Taking**:
- ❌ Not using SOCRATES for pain
