## Dr. Amir Soufi's Principle Applied to Paediatrics

> **"In paediatrics, age IS the differential. From your FIRST question, think: What can cause this symptom at THIS age? A febrile neonate is sepsis until proven otherwise. A febrile toddler with rash might be viral exanthem. A febrile adolescent with headache could be meningitis. The SAME symptom has DIFFERENT life-threatening differentials based on AGE."**

### The Paediatric Differential Mindset

**Traditional Approach**:
- Take full history systematically
- Examine child
- At end, consider differentials
- **Problem**: Missed critical red flags, delayed recognition of life-threatening conditions

**Dr. Amir's Differential-Driven Approach**:
1. **Age + Presenting Symptom = Immediate Differential**
   - First question: "How old is [child's name]?" → Establishes age group
   - Chief complaint + age → Generates age-specific differential list
   - Example: "3-week-old with fever" → Think immediately: Sepsis, meningitis, UTI (until proven otherwise)

2. **Let Differential Guide History**
   - Each subsequent question narrows or expands differential
   - Questions targeted to rule in/out life-threatening causes first
   - Example: Fever + rash → Ask about purpura, capillary refill, GCS → Ruling out meningococcal septicaemia

3. **Pattern Recognition by Age**
   - **Neonate (0-28 days)**: Sepsis, congenital abnormalities, metabolic disorders, birth trauma
   - **Infant (1-12 months)**: Bronchiolitis, gastroenteritis, febrile convulsion, non-accidental injury, congenital heart disease
   - **Child (1-12 years)**: Viral illnesses, asthma, appendicitis, Kawasaki disease, meningitis
   - **Adolescent (12-18 years)**: Mental health, substance use, sexual health, eating disorders, chronic disease management

4. **Triple Assessment in Paediatrics**
   - **Severity assessment**: Well vs unwell vs critically unwell (ALWAYS first)
   - **Diagnosis**: What is causing symptoms?
   - **Safeguarding**: Is this child safe? Non-accidental injury concerns?

## Age Groups in Paediatrics: Critical Definitions

Understanding age classifications is ESSENTIAL for differential diagnosis:

| Age Group | Definition | Key Differential Considerations |
|-----------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| **Neonate** | 0-28 days | Sepsis (GBS, E. coli, Listeria), congenital abnormalities, birth trauma, metabolic disorders, neonatal jaundice |
| **Infant** | 1-12 months | Bronchiolitis (RSV), gastroenteritis, febrile convulsion, developmental delay, non-accidental injury |
| **Toddler** | 1-3 years | Viral URTIs, croup, foreign body aspiration/ingestion, behavioural issues |
| **Preschool** | 3-5 years | Viral exanthems, asthma, accidents/injuries |
| **School-age** | 5-12 years | Asthma, appendicitis, Kawasaki disease, migraine, ADHD |
| **Adolescent** | 12-18 years | Mental health (depression, anxiety), substance use, sexual health, eating disorders, chronic disease compliance |

---

## The PAEDIATRIC Framework for History-Taking

A systematic approach ensuring nothing is missed:

**P - Presenting complaint** (from parent/child/both)
**A - Age, birth history, and development**
**E - Eating and hydration status** (critical for dehydration assessment)
**D - Detail of current illness** (SOCRATES for pain, FEVERISH for fever)
**I - Immunization status** (Australian schedule)
**A - Antenatal, Birth, and Perinatal history** (especially infants)
**T - Treatment already tried** (including OTC, doses, response)
**R - Relevant past medical, surgical, family, social history**
**I - Impact on child and family** (school absence, parent work, social concerns)
**C - Concerns of parent and child** (ICE - Ideas, Concerns, Expectations)

---

## Opening the Consultation: Building Rapport

### Introduction (30 seconds)

**Greet parent AND child** (even if infant - acknowledge the child):
- "Good morning! I'm Dr [Name]. Thanks for coming in today."
- **Address child by name**: "And this must be [child's name]! Hello [child's name]!"
- **Introduce to parent**: "Are you [child's] mum/dad/carer?"
- **Confirm relationship**: "Lovely. And what should I call you?" [Use parent's preferred name throughout]

**Establish rapport with child** (age-appropriate):
- **Infants**: Smile, gentle voice, comment positively ("What a beautiful baby!", "Such lovely eyes!")
- **Toddlers/Preschoolers**: Get to eye level, ask about toy/comfort item ("Is that your special teddy?")
- **School-age**: Friendly questions ("What year are you in at school?", "What's your favourite subject?")
- **Adolescents**: Direct questions, respect autonomy ("I'll ask both you and your mum some questions, is that okay?")

**Common IMG Mistake**: Only addressing parent, ignoring child completely. In Australia, child-centered care is expected.

---

## Step 1: Presenting Complaint + AGE = Immediate Differential

### The Opening Question Sequence

**Question 1 - Confirm Age** (CRITICAL):
- "First, can you confirm [child's] date of birth for me?"
- **Calculate exact age** (mentally or on paper): Days old (if <28 days), months old (if <2 years), years + months
- **Immediate age-based differential forms in your mind**

**Question 2 - Chief Complaint** (open):
- "What's brought you in to see me today?"
- **Listen without interrupting** (let parent speak for 30-60 seconds)
- **Note exact words** (for documentation and understanding parent concerns)

**Question 3 - Timeline**:
- "When did you first notice [symptom]?"
- **Acute vs chronic**: <48 hours = acute (infection, trauma), >2 weeks = chronic (may need specialist referral)

### Age-Based Differential Formulation

**Example 1**: "3-week-old baby with fever"
- **Age**: Neonate (0-28 days)
- **Symptom**: Fever
- **IMMEDIATE DIFFERENTIAL** (think this NOW):
  1. **Sepsis** (GBS, E. coli, Listeria) - LIFE-THREATENING
  2. Meningitis - LIFE-THREATENING
  3. UTI (especially if uncircumcised male)
  4. Viral illness (less likely in neonate with fever)
  5. Over-bundling (environmental)
- **Next questions** target ruling out sepsis: Feeding? Rash? Irritability? Lethargy? Tone?

**Example 2**: "18-month-old with fever and rash"
- **Age**: Infant/toddler (1-12 months, 1-3 years overlap)
- **Symptom**: Fever + rash
- **IMMEDIATE DIFFERENTIAL**:
  1. **Meningococcal septicaemia** (non-blanching rash) - LIFE-THREATENING
  2. **Kawasaki disease** (if fever >5 days + rash + other features) - SERIOUS
  3. Viral exanthem (measles, rubella, roseola, hand-foot-mouth)
  4. Scarlet fever (Group A Strep)
  5. Drug reaction
- **Next questions**: Blanching vs non-blanching? Fever duration? Immunization status? Contacts?

**Example 3**: "7-year-old with abdominal pain"
- **Age**: School-age child (5-12 years)
- **Symptom**: Abdominal pain
- **IMMEDIATE DIFFERENTIAL**:
  1. **Appendicitis** - SURGICAL EMERGENCY
  2. Gastroenteritis
  3. Constipation
  4. Mesenteric adenitis (post-viral)
  5. UTI
  6. Diabetic ketoacidosis (if new-onset Type 1 DM)
  7. **Non-accidental injury** (if inconsistent history)
- **Next questions**: Location? Migration? Vomiting? Bowel movements? Urinary symptoms? SOCRATES?

---

## Step 2: Detailed History of Presenting Complaint

### For FEVER (Common Paediatric Presentation)

Use **FEVERISH** framework:

**F - Fever onset and pattern**
- "When did the fever start?"
- "Have you measured it? What was the temperature?" (Australian parents often use degrees Celsius)
- "Is it constant or coming and going?"
- "Does it respond to paracetamol/ibuprofen?"

**E - Eating and drinking**
- "How is [child] feeding/eating?" (CRITICAL for hydration assessment)
- "Any vomiting or diarrhea?"
- "How many wet nappies today?" (infants) or "How often are they urinating?" (older children)

**V - Vital signs at home** (if measured)
- "Have you noticed fast breathing or any difficulty breathing?"

**E - Energy levels and behaviour**
- "How is their energy? Playful as usual or more tired?"
- "Any drowsiness or difficulty waking them?"
- "How's their mood? Irritable or inconsolable crying?"

**R - Rash**
- "Have you noticed any rash?"
- **If yes**: "Can I check - if you press on it with a glass, does it disappear or stay there?" (blanching vs non-blanching)

**I - Immunization status**
- "Are they up to date with their vaccinations?" (Australian schedule - see section below)

**S - Source of infection**
- **Respiratory**: "Any cough? Runny nose? Ear pulling?"
- **GI**: "Any vomiting? Diarrhea? Tummy pain?"
- **Urinary**: "Any pain with urination? Funny-smelling urine?"
- **Neurological**: "Any headache? Neck stiffness? Sensitivity to light?"
- **Contacts**: "Anyone at home or childcare unwell?"

**H - History of similar episodes**
- "Has this happened before?"
- "Any history of febrile convulsions?"

### For COUGH/RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS

Use **BREATHE** framework:

**B - Breathing pattern**
- "How's their breathing? Fast? Difficult?"
- "Any grunting sounds?" (infant respiratory distress)
- "Are they working hard to breathe? Using tummy muscles?"

**R - Recession** (ask parent to describe or observe)
- "Have you noticed any sucking in between the ribs or at the neck when breathing?"

**E - Exercise tolerance** (age-appropriate)
- Infants: "Can they finish a full feed without getting breathless?"
- Older children: "Can they play normally or do they get breathless quickly?"

**A - Associated symptoms**
- "Any fever? Runny nose? Wheeze?"
- "Any coughing up phlegm? What colour?"

**T - Timing and triggers**
- "When does the cough occur? Night-time? With exercise?"
- "Anything that makes it better or worse?"

**H - History of asthma/atopy**
- "Any history of asthma, eczema, or allergies in the family?"
- "Have they been diagnosed with asthma before?"

**E - Exposures**
- "Any smokers at home?"
- "Any pets?"
- "Could they have breathed in or swallowed something small?" (foreign body)

### For ABDOMINAL PAIN

Use **SOCRATES** (adapted for children):

**S - Site**
- "Where is the pain? Can you point with one finger?" (periumbilical vs localized)
- **Ask child directly if old enough** (>3 years)

**O - Onset**
- "When did it start?"
- "Did it come on suddenly or gradually?"

**C - Character**
- "What does the pain feel like?" (sharp, crampy, constant)
- **Use age-appropriate language**: "Does it feel like a sharp poke or a squeezy feeling?"

**R - Radiation**
- "Does the pain move anywhere else?"
- Appendicitis: Periumbilical → RIF migration

**A - Associated symptoms**
- "Any vomiting? Diarrhea? Fever?"
- "Any pain when urinating?"
- "Any bleeding from bottom?"

**T - Timing**
- "Is the pain constant or does it come and go?"
- "Does it wake them from sleep?" (organic cause more likely)

**E - Exacerbating/Relieving factors**
- "Does anything make it worse? Movement? Eating?"
- "Does anything make it better? Lying still? Paracetamol?"

**S - Severity**
- **Pain scale** (age-appropriate):
  - <4 years: Faces pain scale
  - 4-7 years: "On a scale of 0-5, how bad is the pain?"
  - >7 years: "On a scale of 0-10, how bad is the pain?"
- **Functional impact**: "Can they still play/eat/sleep?"

**RED FLAGS for Abdominal Pain**:
- Bile-stained (green) vomiting → Bowel obstruction
- Periumbilical pain migrating to RIF → Appendicitis
- Severe pain + bloody diarrhea → Intussusception (currant jelly stool)
- Abdominal distension + not passing stool/flatus → Obstruction
- Pain + testicular/scrotal pain → Testicular torsion
- Inconsistent history + bruising → Non-accidental injury

---

## Step 3: Eating, Hydration, and Dehydration Assessment

**CRITICAL in paediatrics**: Children dehydrate FASTER than adults due to:
- Higher surface area to volume ratio
- Higher metabolic rate
- Inability to independently access fluids (especially infants)

### Hydration Assessment Questions

**For Infants** (<12 months):
- "How many bottles/breastfeeds have they had today compared to usual?"
- "Are they finishing feeds or stopping partway through?"
- "How many wet nappies today?" (Normal: ≥6/day for infants)
- "When was the last wet nappy?"
- "Are the nappies as heavy as usual or lighter?"

**For Children** (>12 months):
- "How much are they drinking today compared to usual?"
- "How many times have they urinated today?" (Normal: ≥4/day for children)
- "When was the last time they passed urine?"
- "What does the urine look like? Dark or pale?"

**Vomiting**:
- "How many times have they vomited?"
- "What comes up? Food? Fluid? Bile (green/yellow)?"
- "Can they keep anything down? Even small sips?"

**Diarrhea**:
- "How many episodes of diarrhea?"
- "What does it look like?" (watery, bloody, mucousy)
- "Any blood in the stool?"

### Clinical Dehydration Assessment (to confirm on examination)

| Feature | No Dehydration | Some Dehydration (3-5%) | Severe Dehydration (>5%) |
|---------|----------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Appearance | Alert, well | Restless, irritable | Lethargic, drowsy, floppy |
| Eyes | Normal | Sunken | Very sunken |
| Tears | Present | Reduced | Absent |
| Mouth/Tongue | Moist | Dry | Very dry |
| Skin turgor | Normal | Reduced | Tenting |
| Urine output | Normal | Reduced | Minimal/none |
| Capillary refill | <2 sec | 2-3 sec | >3 sec |

**Dehydration = Admission for IV fluids** (if severe or unable to tolerate oral)

---

## Step 4: Birth History and Development (ESPECIALLY for Infants <2 years)

### Antenatal History

**Pregnancy complications**:
- "How was the pregnancy? Any complications?"
- "Any infections during pregnancy?" (CMV, toxoplasmosis, rubella → congenital abnormalities)
- "Did mum take any medications during pregnancy?"

### Birth History

**Delivery**:
- "How was the delivery? Vaginal or caesarean?"
- "Were there any complications during delivery?"
- "Was [child] born at full term or early?" (Gestational age at birth)

**Immediate post-birth**:
- "Did [child] cry straight away?"
- "Did they need any help with breathing or go to special care?"
- "What was the birth weight?" (Normal: 2.5-4.5 kg)

**Neonatal period**:
- "Any jaundice needing phototherapy?"
- "Any problems with feeding in the first few weeks?"

### Developmental Milestones

**Ask age-appropriate questions**:

**Gross motor**:
- 6 months: "Can they sit unsupported?"
- 12 months: "Are they walking yet or cruising?"
- 18 months: "Can they walk confidently? Run?"

**Fine motor**:
- 6 months: "Can they reach for toys and pass them hand to hand?"
- 12 months: "Can they pick up small objects with finger and thumb (pincer grip)?"
- 18 months: "Can they scribble with a crayon?"

**Speech/Language**:
- 12 months: "Do they say any words? Like 'mama' or 'dada'?"
- 18 months: "How many words can they say?" (Should have ≥6 words)
- 2 years: "Can they put two words together?" (e.g., "more milk")

**Social**:
- 6 months: "Do they smile at you? Laugh?"
- 12 months: "Do they wave bye-bye?"
- 18 months: "Can they point to things they want?"

**RED FLAGS - Developmental Delay**:
- Not sitting by 9 months
- Not walking by 18 months
- No words by 18 months
- Loss of previously acquired skills (REGRESSION) → Urgent investigation (autism, metabolic disorder, neurodegenerative)

---

## Step 5: Immunization Status (Australian Schedule)

**Always ask**: "Are they up to date with their vaccinations?"

### Australian National Immunization Program (NIP) Schedule 2024

| Age | Vaccines |
|-----|----------|
| **Birth** | Hep B (if high-risk mother) |
| **2 months** | 6-in-1 (DTaP-Hep B-IPV-Hib), Pneumococcal, Rotavirus |
| **4 months** | 6-in-1, Pneumococcal, Rotavirus |
| **6 months** | 6-in-1, Pneumococcal (if Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander or high-risk) |
| **12 months** | MMR, Meningococcal ACWY, Pneumococcal |
| **18 months** | 4-in-1 (DTaP-IPV), Hib, Meningococcal B (if Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander) |
| **4 years** | 4-in-1 (DTaP-IPV), MMR |
| **10-15 years** | HPV (2 doses, 6-12 months apart), dTpa (Year 7) |

**Why Immunization Status Matters**:
- **Unvaccinated child with fever + rash** → Think measles, rubella (rare but serious)
- **Missed Hib vaccine + epiglottitis** → Haemophilus influenzae B
- **Missed pneumococcal + severe pneumonia** → S. pneumoniae

**Document**: "Vaccinations up to date as per Australian NIP schedule" OR "Vaccinations delayed - last vaccine was [X] at [age]"

---

## Step 6: Past Medical, Surgical, and Family History

### Past Medical History

**Chronic conditions** (affect management):
- "Does [child] have any ongoing medical conditions?"
- Asthma, eczema, diabetes, epilepsy, congenital heart disease, immune deficiency

**Previous hospitalizations**:
- "Have they been admitted to hospital before? What for?"
- Recurrent admissions → Think chronic condition or safeguarding concern

**Allergies**:
- "Any allergies to medications or foods?"
- **If yes**: "What happens when they're exposed?" (anaphylaxis vs intolerance)

### Medications

- "Are they on any regular medications?" (Including inhalers, supplements)
- "Have you given anything for this illness?" (Paracetamol, ibuprofen, cough medicine)
- **Document doses**: "How much paracetamol did you give and when?"
- **Check correct dosing**: Paracetamol 15 mg/kg/dose (max 4 doses/day)

### Family History

**Relevant conditions**:
- "Any family history of asthma, eczema, allergies?" (atopy)
- "Any family history of sudden death in childhood?" (cardiac conditions, SIDS)
- "Anyone in the family with similar symptoms?" (infection contacts)

### Social History

**Household**:
- "Who lives at home with [child]?"
- "Any smokers at home?" (respiratory illness risk, SIDS risk)
- "Any pets?"

**Childcare/School**:
- "Does [child] go to childcare or school?"
- "How are they going there? Any concerns from teachers?"
- "Any recent absences due to illness?"

**Safeguarding screen** (ask sensitively):
- "How are things at home generally?"
- **If injury**: "Can you tell me exactly how this happened?" (Mechanism matches injury?)

## RED FLAGS in Paediatrics: When to Escalate Urgently

### TRAFFIC LIGHT SYSTEM (NICE Feverish Child Guidelines)

**RED (High Risk - Urgent Hospital Admission)**:
- Age <3 months with fever ≥38°C
- Non-blanching rash
- Cyanosis, grunting, severe respiratory distress
- Reduced consciousness, not responding to social cues

- Seizure

**AMBER (Intermediate Risk - Clinical Review within 2-4 hours)**:
- Age 3-6 months with fever ≥39°C
- Fever ≥5 days
- Reduced activity, not smiling
- Dry mucous membranes, reduced urine output
- Nasal flaring, tachypnoea

**GREEN (Low Risk - Discharge with Safety-Net)**:
- Age >6 months, feeding normally, alert, responsive
- Moist mucous membranes, normal urine output
- Fever responding to antipyretics

### SEPSIS RED FLAGS (Paediatric Sepsis 6)

**Any child with suspected sepsis** → Activate Paediatric Sepsis Pathway:
1. Give high-flow oxygen
2. Obtain IV/IO access, take bloods (FBC, CRP, lactate, blood cultures)
3. Give IV antibiotics (within 1 hour)
4. Consider IV fluid resuscitation (20 mL/kg bolus)
5. Involve senior clinician early
6. Consider inotropic support (PICU)

**Sepsis Features**:
- Tachycardia, tachypnoea
- Prolonged capillary refill >2 seconds
- Hypotension (late sign)
- Mottled/pale/cyanosed skin
- Reduced consciousness
- Fever or hypothermia

### NON-ACCIDENTAL INJURY (NAI) RED FLAGS

**Always consider safeguarding**:

**History**:
- Inconsistent/changing history
- Delay in seeking medical attention
- Mechanism doesn't match injury
- Injury inconsistent with developmental stage (e.g., bruising in non-mobile infant)

**Examination**:
- Bruises in unusual locations (ears, neck, genitalia)
- Patterned bruises (handprints, ligature marks)
- Multiple injuries at different stages of healing
- Fractures in infants (especially ribs, metaphyseal fractures)
- Retinal haemorrhages (shaken baby syndrome)
- Burns with clear demarcation (immersion burns)

**Action**:
- Document carefully (body map, photographs with consent)
- Discuss with senior colleague
- Contact paediatric safeguarding team
- Notify Child Protection Helpline (if immediate risk)
- **NEVER accuse parents** - remain professional and empathetic

## Common IMG Mistakes in Paediatric History-Taking

### Mistake 1: Not Building Rapport with Child

**Problem**: Only addressing parent, ignoring child completely

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Child feels excluded, may not cooperate with examination
- Australian child-centered care expects child engagement
- Misses opportunity to assess child's demeanor, responsiveness, development

**Correct Approach**:
- Greet child by name, get to eye level
- Use age-appropriate language and questions
- Observe child throughout consultation (Are they playing? Alert? Interactive?)
- For adolescents, offer to speak alone

---

### Mistake 2: Not Assessing Age-Appropriate Developmental Milestones

**Problem**: Taking history without asking about development (especially <2 years)

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Developmental delay is common presentation in paediatrics
- Early intervention improves outcomes (autism, cerebral palsy)
- Red flag for safeguarding (neglect, abuse)

**Correct Approach**:
- For ALL children <2 years, ask: "How is [child] developing compared to other children their age?"
- Ask specific milestone questions (see earlier section)
- Document: "Developmental milestones appropriate for age" OR "Concern about [specific domain] delay"

---

### Mistake 3: Not Asking About Immunization Status

**Problem**: Forgetting to ask if child is vaccinated

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Affects differential (unvaccinated → measles, Hib epiglottitis, invasive pneumococcal disease)
- Public health notification required for vaccine-preventable diseases
- Opportunity for catch-up vaccination

**Correct Approach**:
- Always ask: "Is [child] up to date with their vaccinations?"
- If not, document which vaccines missed
- Consider differential based on vaccination status

---

### Mistake 4: Not Assessing Hydration Status in Vomiting/Diarrhea

**Problem**: Taking history about vomiting/diarrhea without asking about fluid intake and urine output

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Dehydration is main risk in gastroenteritis
- Determines management (oral vs IV rehydration, admission vs discharge)

**Correct Approach**:
- For ANY vomiting/diarrhea: "How much are they drinking? How many wet nappies/toilet trips?"
- Ask about last urine output: "When did they last wee?"
- Assess severity: "Are they keeping any fluids down?"

---

### Mistake 5: Not Screening for Safeguarding Concerns

**Problem**: Not asking "How did this injury happen?" for any trauma/bruising

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Missed opportunity to identify non-accidental injury
- Legal obligation to report child protection concerns in Australia

**Correct Approach**:
- For ANY injury: "Can you tell me exactly how this happened?"
- Ask child (if verbal): "How did you hurt yourself?"
- Document mechanism in detail
- If inconsistent → Discuss with senior, safeguarding team

---

### Mistake 6: Using Medical Jargon with Parents

**Problem**: "Does your child have dyspnoea?" "Any haematemesis?"

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Parents don't understand medical terminology
- Miscommunication leads to missed diagnoses

**Correct Approach**:
- Use plain language: "Is their breathing fast or difficult?" "Any blood in the vomit?"
- Check understanding: "Does that make sense?"

---

### Mistake 7: Not Involving Adolescent in Consultation

**Problem**: Speaking only to parent when adolescent is present

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Disrespects adolescent's autonomy
- Misses opportunity to assess mental health, risk behaviours
- Adolescent less likely to disclose sensitive information (sexual health, substance use)

**Correct Approach**:
- Direct questions to adolescent: "How are you feeling?"
- Offer confidential time alone: "Would it be okay if I speak to [adolescent's name] alone for a few minutes?"
- Use HEADSS assessment

---

### Mistake 8: Not Checking Medication Dosing

**Problem**: Accepting "I gave paracetamol" without asking dose/frequency

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Paracetamol overdose is hepatotoxic
- Underdosing → ineffective fever management
- Determines if fever truly "not responding to paracetamol" vs inadequate dosing

**Correct Approach**:
- "What dose of paracetamol did you give? How much does [child] weigh?"
- **Correct dosing**: Paracetamol 15 mg/kg/dose, max 4 doses/day (60 mg/kg/day)
- Example: 10 kg child → 150 mg/dose (7.5 mL of paracetamol 100 mg/5 mL syrup)

- Fever: Temp 38.5°C, started yesterday, responds to paracetamol
- Eating: Still breastfeeding but taking less, wet nappies reduced (3 today, usually 6)
- Respiratory: Runny nose, cough, no difficulty breathing
- Rash: None
- Behaviour: A bit more sleepy than usual but still smiling
- Immunizations: Up to date (2-month vaccines received)
- Contacts: Older sibling has cold
- Birth history: Full-term, normal delivery, no complications
- Development: Rolling, smiling, cooing (appropriate for age)

**Model Performance** (8 minutes):

- "Good morning! I'm Dr [Name]. Thanks for bringing Riley in today."
- **Address baby**: "Hello Riley! Aren't you gorgeous!"
- **To mother**: "And are you Riley's mum? Lovely to meet you. What should I call you?"
- "What pronouns does Riley use?" [Mother: "She/her"]
- "Great, thank you. So what's brought you in with Riley today?"

**Minutes 1-3: Presenting Complaint + Differential Formation**
- [Mother: "She's had a fever since yesterday and I'm worried"]
- **Age confirmation**: "First, can I just confirm Riley's date of birth?" [Calculate: 4 months old → INFANT]
- **IMMEDIATE DIFFERENTIAL FORMS**: Viral URTI, bronchiolitis, UTI, otitis media
- "When did you first notice the fever?"
- "Have you measured her temperature? What was it?" [38.5°C]
- "Have you given her any paracetamol? Did it bring the fever down?" [Yes, came down to 37.8°C]

**Minutes 3-5: FEVERISH Framework**
- **Eating**: "How is Riley feeding? Is she breastfed or bottle-fed?" [Breastfed] "How many feeds has she had today compared to usual?" [4 today, usually 6]
- **Hydration**: "How many wet nappies has Riley had today?" [3 today, usually 6] → **DEHYDRATION RISK**
- **Rash**: "Have you noticed any rash at all?" [No]
- **Source**:
  - **Respiratory**: "Any cough? Runny nose?" [Yes, runny nose and cough] "Any difficulty breathing or fast breathing?" [No]
  - **GI**: "Any vomiting or diarrhea?" [No]
  - **Urinary**: "Any funny-smelling urine or crying when passing urine?" [No, but wet nappies are reduced]
  - **Neuro**: "How is her energy? Still playful or more sleepy?" [A bit more sleepy but still smiling]
- **Contacts**: "Anyone else at home unwell?" [Yes, older sibling has cold]
- **Immunizations**: "Is Riley up to date with her vaccinations?" [Yes, had 2-month vaccines]

**Minutes 5-6: Birth History + Development**
- "How was the pregnancy and delivery?" [Normal]
- "Was Riley born full-term?" [Yes]
- "Any complications after birth?" [No]
- "How is Riley developing? Can she roll over?" [Yes]
- "Does she smile and coo at you?" [Yes] → **Development appropriate**

**Minutes 6-7: Past History + Red Flags**
- "Any previous admissions to hospital?" [No]
- "Any medical conditions?" [No]
- "Any medications or allergies?" [No]
- **Red flag screen**: "Any neck stiffness? Floppy or stiff? Any rash that doesn't disappear when you press on it?" [No to all]

**Minutes 7-8: ICE + Summarize**
- "What are you most worried about?" [Mother: "I'm worried it's meningitis"]
- **Empathy**: "I can understand why you're worried. The good news is Riley doesn't have signs of meningitis like a rash or neck stiffness."
- **Summarize**: "So Riley is a 4-month-old with fever since yesterday, runny nose and cough, taking less feeds, and reduced wet nappies. Her older sibling has a cold. This sounds like a viral upper respiratory infection."
- **Plan**: "I'd like to examine Riley and check her urine to rule out a urine infection, as that can cause fever without obvious symptoms in babies. We'll also check her hydration. Does that sound okay?"

**Examiner's Expected Differential**:
1. Viral URTI (most likely - contacts, coryzal symptoms)
2. UTI (reduced wet nappies, no localizing signs)
3. Bronchiolitis (cough, age 4 months)
4. Otitis media (examine ears)

He's vomited once and has a low-grade fever. This could be appendicitis, so I'd like to examine Alex's tummy carefully and possibly arrange some blood tests and an ultrasound."
- **Safety-net**: "If the pain gets worse, he develops a high fever, or he can't keep fluids down, come back straight away or go to the Emergency Department."

**Examiner's Expected Differential**:
1. **Appendicitis** (most likely - periumbilical → RIF migration, anorexia, vomiting, low-grade fever)
2. Mesenteric adenitis (post-viral, but less likely with migration)

## Summary: Key Takeaways for Paediatric History-Taking

### 1. Age-Based Differential Thinking
- **From the FIRST question (age), formulate differential**
- Same symptom = different diagnoses based on age
- Neonate with fever = sepsis. Toddler with fever + rash = viral vs meningococcal. Adolescent with headache = migraine vs mental health

### 2. Triple Assessment Every Time
- **Severity**: Well, unwell, or critically unwell?
- **Diagnosis**: What's causing symptoms?
- **Safeguarding**: Is this child safe?

### 3. Hydration Assessment is CRITICAL
- For any vomiting/diarrhea: Ask about fluid intake + urine output
- "How many wet nappies?" (infants) or "When did they last wee?" (children)
- Dehydration → Admission for IV fluids

### 4. Always Ask About Development (Especially <2 years)
- Gross motor, fine motor, speech, social
- Red flags: Not sitting by 9 months, not walking by 18 months, no words by 18 months
- **Regression** (loss of skills) = Urgent investigation

### 5. Immunization Status Affects Differential
- Unvaccinated + fever/rash → Think measles, Hib epiglottitis, invasive pneumococcal
- Always ask: "Are they up to date with vaccinations?"

### 6. Build Rapport with BOTH Parent and Child
- Greet child by name, get to eye level
- Use age-appropriate language
- Observe child throughout (alert? playful? responsive?)

### 7. Red Flags Requiring Urgent Action
- **Neonate <28 days with fever ≥38°C** → Septic screen + IV antibiotics + admission
- **Non-blanching rash** → Meningococcal septicaemia → IM/IV benzylpenicillin immediately
- **Bile-stained vomiting** → Bowel obstruction/malrotation → Surgical review
- **Periumbilical pain → RIF migration** → Appendicitis → Surgical review

### 8. Safeguarding is Part of Every Consultation
- For injuries: "How did this happen?"
- Inconsistent history, delay in seeking help, developmental stage mismatch → NAI concern
- Document carefully, discuss with senior, contact safeguarding team

### 9. Adolescent-Specific Approach
- Offer confidential time alone (with parent's permission)
- Use HEADSS assessment
- Screen for mental health, substance use, sexual health
- Balance autonomy with safeguarding

### 10. Common IMG Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Not building rapport with child
- ❌ Not asking about development
- ❌ Not asking about immunizations
- ❌ Not assessing hydration in vomiting/diarrhea
- ❌ Not screening for safeguarding
- ❌ Using medical jargon with parents
- ❌ Not involving adolescent in consultation
- ❌ Not checking medication dosing

---

**Practice, Practice, Practice**: Use these frameworks in every paediatric case. The more you practice age-based differential thinking, the more instinctive it becomes. Remember: In paediatrics, age IS the differential!

---

**Next Steps**:
- Practice with mock OSCE stations above
- Review Australian immunization schedule (know it by heart!)
- Learn developmental milestones for each age group
- Study red flags for sepsis, dehydration, safeguarding
- Practice HEADSS assessment for adolescents

**Good luck with your ICRP preparation! You've got this!**
