## Dr. Amir Soufi's Principle Applied to Paediatric Examination

> **"In paediatrics, examination findings CONFIRM your differential formed from history. Examination is FLEXIBLE - you adapt to the child, not the child to you. If child is crying, start with auscultation (heart/lungs) BEFORE undressing. If child is playful, observe first. The MOST important skill is building rapport - a calm, cooperative child gives you accurate findings."**

### The Paediatric Examination Mindset

**Traditional Approach**:
- Rigid, systematic examination from head to toe
- Child becomes distressed, uncooperative
- **Problem**: Inaccurate findings (tachycardia from crying, cannot assess respiratory rate), poor exam technique

**Dr. Amir's Adapted Approach**:
1. **Observe First (Before Touching)**
   - General appearance: Well, unwell, or critically unwell?
   - Respiratory: Rate, recession, colour
   - Behaviour: Alert, playful, irritable, drowsy
   - **This gives you 50% of the diagnosis without touching the child**

2. **Opportunistic Examination** (Adapt to Child's State)
   - If child is calm/asleep on parent's lap → Auscultate heart/lungs FIRST (before undressing)
   - If child is playful → Engage with toys, examine peripheries first (hands, feet)
   - If child is crying → Leave distressing parts to end (ENT, abdomen)

3. **Integrate Findings with Differential**
   - Every finding either supports or refutes your pre-examination differential
   - Example: History suggests bronchiolitis → Examination confirms wheeze, bilateral crackles, mild recession

## General Principles of Paediatric Examination

### The 5 Ps of Paediatric Examination

**P - Preparation**
- Wash hands
- Introduce yourself to parent AND child
- Warm hands, warm stethoscope (rub between palms)
- Comfortable environment (warm room, toys/distractions available)

**P - Permission**
- Explain examination to parent: "I'd like to examine [child's name]. Is that okay?"
- Ask child (age-appropriate): "Can I have a look at you?" "Can I listen to your chest?"
- Inform parents they can stay with child throughout

**P - Position**
- **Young children (<2 years)**: On parent's lap (less distressing)
- **Older children (>2 years)**: On examination couch (if cooperative) or parent's lap
- **Adolescents**: On couch, offer chaperone

**P - Play and Distraction**
- Use toys, bubbles, lights, phone videos (with parent's permission)
- Engage child: "Can you show me your tongue?" "Can you take a big breath like you're blowing out candles?"
- Make it fun: "I'm going to listen to your tummy. Can you hear the rumbles?"

**P - Proceed Systematically (but Flexibly)**
- Start with least distressing (observation, hands)
- Leave most distressing to end (throat, ears, abdomen if tender)
- If child becomes distressed, pause and console

### Age-Specific Adaptations

| Age Group | Approach | Distraction Techniques | Position |
|-----------|----------|----------------------|----------|
| **Neonate (<28 days)** | Gentle handling, warm hands, minimal disturbance | Not needed (usually sleeping) | Flat on exam table or parent's arms |
| **Infant (1-12 months)** | Stranger anxiety develops ~6 months | Toy, rattle, light torch, peek-a-boo | Parent's lap (preferred) |
| **Toddler (1-3 years)** | Separation anxiety, tantrums common | Bubbles, teddy bear, phone videos | Parent's lap |
| **Preschool (3-5 years)** | More cooperative, likes to help | Stickers, counting games, "Can you help me?" | Exam couch or parent's lap |
| **School-age (5-12 years)** | Cooperative, understands explanations | Conversation (school, hobbies), involvement ("Can you take a big breath?") | Exam couch |
| **Adolescent (12-18 years)** | Self-conscious, offer privacy | Respectful conversation, explain each step | Exam couch, chaperone offered |

## 1. GENERAL INSPECTION (Observation BEFORE Touching)

**Dr. Amir's Principle**: **"50% of paediatric diagnosis is OBSERVATION. Before you touch the child, observe: Are they well, unwell, or critically unwell? This determines urgency. Respiratory rate and work of breathing tell you if they need oxygen NOW."**

### ABC Assessment (First Priority for Acutely Unwell Child)

**A - Airway**:
- Patent? Any stridor, drooling, inability to speak?
- Position: Tripod position (epiglottitis), head extension (respiratory distress)

**B - Breathing**:
- **Respiratory rate** (count for 30 seconds × 2, while child calm):
  - <1 year: 30-40/min
  - 1-2 years: 25-35/min
  - 2-5 years: 25-30/min
  - 5-12 years: 20-25/min
  - >12 years: 15-20/min
- **Work of breathing**:
  - **Recession**: Subcostal, intercostal, suprasternal, supraclavicular
  - **Nasal flaring**
  - **Grunting** (forced expiration against closed glottis - severe respiratory distress)
  - **Head bobbing** (infants - using accessory muscles)
  - **Tracheal tug** (downward movement of trachea with inspiration)
- **Oxygen saturations**: Attach pulse oximeter (normal ≥95% in air)
- **Colour**: Pink (normal), pale (anaemia, shock), cyanosed (central vs peripheral), mottled (sepsis, shock)

**C - Circulation**:
- **Heart rate** (palpate brachial/femoral pulse while child calm):
  - <1 year: 110-160 bpm
  - 1-2 years: 100-150 bpm
  - 2-5 years: 95-140 bpm
  - 5-12 years: 80-120 bpm
  - >12 years: 60-100 bpm
- **Capillary refill time (CRT)**: Press sternum for 5 seconds, release, count seconds until colour returns
  - Normal: <2 seconds
  - Prolonged (>2 sec): Dehydration, shock, sepsis
- **Skin**: Warm peripheries (normal), cool peripheries (shock, dehydration), mottled (sepsis)

**D - Disability (Neurological)**:
- **AVPU score**:
  - A = Alert (normal)
  - V = Responds to Voice
  - P = Responds to Pain only
  - U = Unresponsive
- **GCS** (if older child): E + V + M (3-15)
- **Posture**: Floppy/hypotonic (sepsis, meningitis), stiff/hypertonic, seizure activity
- **Pupils**: Equal, reactive to light

**E - Exposure**:
- **Temperature**: Measure (normal 36.5-37.5°C)
- **Rash**: Blanching vs non-blanching (glass test)
- **Bruising**: Location, pattern (safeguarding concerns if unusual sites)

**If Child is CRITICALLY UNWELL** (abnormal ABCDE):
- **Call for help immediately**
- **Oxygen** (high-flow if needed)
- **IV/IO access**
- **Senior clinician + resuscitation team**
- **Do NOT delay** for full examination

### General Appearance (If Stable)

**Observe from doorway or while child on parent's lap**:

**Well, Unwell, or Critically Unwell?**
- **Well**: Alert, playful, interactive, smiling, normal colour, feeding normally
- **Unwell**: Reduced activity, not playing, irritable, pale, reduced feeding
- **Critically unwell**: Lethargic/floppy, drowsy, not responding to parents, mottled/cyanosed, grunting/severe respiratory distress

**Growth and Nutrition**:
- Appropriate size for age? (Plot on growth chart if available)
- Wasted (muscle bulk reduced, ribs visible)?
- Obese?

**Dysmorphic Features**:

- Smiling, making eye contact?

**Respiratory Effort** (observe chest):
- Recession (as above)
- Use of accessory muscles
- Paradoxical breathing (abdomen moves opposite to chest - severe respiratory distress)

**Skin**:
- Colour: Pink, pale, jaundiced, cyanosed (central tongue/lips vs peripheral fingers/toes)
- Rash: Distribution, blanching vs non-blanching
- Birthmarks: Strawberry naevus (capillary haemangioma), port-wine stain, Mongolian blue spot (normal variant, sacral area)

## 2. NEWBORN EXAMINATION (Baby Check)

**Dr. Amir's Principle**: **"Newborn examination is SCREENING, not diagnostic. You're looking for congenital abnormalities: heart murmurs (congenital heart disease), hip clicks (DDH), undescended testes, cataracts, cleft palate. Do it systematically: Top to toe, front to back, never miss the hips, heart, and red reflex."**

**Timing**: Performed within 72 hours of birth (by midwife or doctor), repeated at 6-8 weeks (GP)

**Setting**: Warm, quiet room, good lighting, baby undressed on flat surface

### Systematic Newborn Examination (Head to Toe)

**1. General Inspection**:
- **Colour**: Pink (normal), jaundiced (check bilirubin if <24 hours or significant), cyanosed (congenital heart disease, respiratory distress)
- **Tone**: Active movements, flexed posture (normal), floppy/hypotonic, stiff/hypertonic
- **Cry**: Vigorous (normal), high-pitched (neurological), weak/absent
- **Appearance**: Dysmorphic features, birth trauma (caput succedaneum, cephalhaematoma)

---

**2. Head and Face**:

**Fontanelles**:
- **Anterior fontanelle**: Diamond-shaped, 2-3 cm, closes by 18-24 months
- **Posterior fontanelle**: Triangular, <1 cm, closes by 2-3 months
- **Palpate**: Should be soft, flat (not sunken, not bulging)
  - Sunken = Dehydration
  - Bulging = Raised ICP (meningitis, hydrocephalus)

**Head shape**:
- Moulding (overlapping skull bones - normal, resolves in days)
- **Caput succedaneum**: Soft, oedematous swelling crossing suture lines (resolves in days)
- **Cephalhaematoma**: Firm swelling limited by suture lines (subperiosteal bleed, resolves in weeks, risk of jaundice)

**Eyes**:
- **Red reflex** (MUST check BOTH eyes with ophthalmoscope):
  - Technique: 30 cm away, look for red/orange glow through pupil
  - Absent/white reflex = **Congenital cataract, retinoblastoma** → Urgent ophthalmology referral
- **Inspect**: Size (microphthalmia?), conjunctivitis (sticky eye common, clean with saline), subconjunctival haemorrhage (normal, resolves)
- **Corneal light reflex**: Shine light, check symmetrical reflection on both pupils (excludes squint)

**Ears**:
- **Position**: Low-set ears → Chromosomal abnormality (Down syndrome, Turner syndrome)
- **Shape**: Pre-auricular skin tags or pits (common, usually benign)
- **Hearing**: Newborn hearing screening (automated OAE or ABR) - should be done before discharge

**Nose**:
- Patent nostrils (babies are obligate nose breathers)
- Check with wisp of cotton wool (moves with breathing)

**Mouth**:
- **Cleft lip/palate**: Inspect, palpate hard palate with finger (feel for posterior cleft)
  - Cleft palate may be MISSED if not palpated
- **Tongue**: Size (macroglossia in Down syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann), tongue-tie (ankyloglossia - frenulum attachment)
- **Teeth**: Natal teeth (rare, usually lower incisors, may need removal if loose)

**Face**:
- Symmetry: Facial palsy (birth trauma, forceps delivery) - asymmetry when crying
- Dysmorphic features: Flat facial profile (Down syndrome), micrognathia (Pierre Robin sequence)

---

**3. Neck**:

- Recession: Subcostal, intercostal (respiratory distress)
- Breathing pattern: Periodic breathing (normal - pauses <10 sec), apnoea (pauses >20 sec - pathological)

**Palpation**:
- **Apex beat**: 4th intercostal space, midclavicular line (or just outside)
- **Brachial pulses**: Bilateral (both arms), equal volume
- **Femoral pulses**: Bilateral (both groins), equal volume and timing with brachial
  - **Absent or weak femoral pulses** = **Coarctation of aorta** → URGENT cardiology referral

**Auscultation** (Warm stethoscope, baby calm):
- **Heart sounds**: S1 (mitral/tricuspid closure), S2 (aortic/pulmonary closure)
- **Murmurs**:
  - **Location**: Listen in 4 areas (aortic, pulmonary, tricuspid, mitral) + axilla, back
  - **Timing**: Systolic (S1 to S2) vs diastolic (S2 to S1)
  - **Loudness**: Grade 1-6/6
  - **Character**: Ejection systolic, pansystolic, machinery
  - **Radiation**: To carotids, back, axilla

**CRITICAL**:
- **ANY murmur in newborn** = Potential congenital heart disease → Needs assessment
- **Innocent murmurs** are RARE in first 48 hours
- **If murmur detected**:
  - Check for other signs: Cyanosis, tachypnoea, poor feeding, hepatomegaly
  - Check oxygen saturations (pre-ductal right hand and post-ductal foot - >95%, difference <3%)
  - **Refer to paediatrics** (echocardiogram within 24-72 hours)

**Common Congenital Heart Disease**:
- **VSD** (Ventricular Septal Defect): Pansystolic murmur, left lower sternal edge, commonest
- **PDA** (Patent Ductus Arteriosus): Continuous "machinery" murmur, left upper sternal edge
- **Coarctation of aorta**: Weak/absent femoral pulses, radio-femoral delay, ejection systolic murmur
- **Tetralogy of Fallot**: Cyanosis, ejection systolic murmur (pulmonary stenosis)

---

**5. Abdomen**:

**Inspection**:
- Shape: Scaphoid (diaphragmatic hernia), distended (obstruction, ascites)
- Umbilical cord: 2 arteries + 1 vein (single umbilical artery → VACTERL association, renal abnormalities)
- Umbilical stump: Clean, dry (should fall off 5-15 days), signs of infection (redness, discharge, foul smell → omphalitis)

**Palpation** (use warmed hands, baby relaxed):
- **Liver**: Normally palpable 1-2 cm below costal margin (RCM)
  - Enlarged liver = Heart failure, infection, storage disorder
- **Spleen**: Normally NOT palpable
  - Palpable spleen = Haemolysis, infection, portal hypertension
- **Kidneys**: Palpable by bimanual palpation (one hand on back, one on abdomen)
  - Enlarged kidneys = Polycystic kidney disease, hydronephrosis, renal vein thrombosis
- **Bladder**: May be palpable if full (normal)
- **Masses**: Abdominal masses in newborn (common): Renal (70%), GI (15%), genital (15%)

**Genitalia** (MUST examine):

**Male**:
- **Inspect**:
  - Penis: Normal size, urethral meatus at tip (hypospadias = meatus on ventral surface, epispadias = dorsal surface)
  - **Hypospadias** → Do NOT circumcise (foreskin needed for surgical repair)
  - Scrotum: Rugose (normal), hydrocele (transilluminates, common, resolves by 1 year)
- **Palpate**:
  - **Testes**: Both descended into scrotum? (palpate along inguinal canal if not in scrotum)
  - **Undescended testis** (cryptorchidism): Refer to paediatric surgery (orchidopexy by 12 months to preserve fertility)

**Female**:
- **Inspect**:
  - Labia: Normal appearance
  - Vaginal discharge/bleeding: Normal in first week (maternal oestrogen withdrawal)
  - Imperforate hymen (rare)
  - Ambiguous genitalia (virilization, congenital adrenal hyperplasia) → URGENT referral

- **Inspect**: Present, patent (meconium should pass within 24-48 hours)
  - **Imperforate anus** → URGENT surgical referral

---

**6. Back and Spine**:
- **Inspect**: Midline, straight

- Single palmar crease (Simian crease): Down syndrome, normal variant

**Tone and Movements**:
- **Observe spontaneous movements**: Symmetrical, all limbs moving
- **Moro reflex** (startle reflex): Sudden head drop (support head and neck, lower quickly) → Baby abducts and extends arms, then adducts (hugs)
  - Absent or asymmetrical = Neurological problem, brachial plexus injury (Erb's palsy)

---

**8. Hips (CRITICAL - Do NOT Miss)**:

**Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH)**: 1-2% incidence, if missed → Abnormal gait, early osteoarthritis

**Risk Factors**:
- Breech presentation
- Family history
- Female
- Firstborn
- Oligohydramnios

**Examination** (performed at END of examination, baby calm):

**Barlow Test** (Tests for dislocatable hip):
- **Technique**:
  - Hips flexed 90°, knees flexed 90°
  - Thumb on inner thigh, fingers on greater trochanter
  - **Adduct hip** (bring knee toward midline) while applying **posterior pressure** (push back)
  - **Positive**: Clunk (hip dislocates posteriorly out of acetabulum)

**Ortolani Test** (Tests for dislocated hip that can be relocated):
- **Technique**:
  - Same position as Barlow
  - **Abduct hip** (bring knee outward) while applying **anterior pressure** (lift up)
  - **Positive**: Clunk (hip relocates into acetabulum)

**CRITICAL**:
- **CLUNK** (felt by examiner) = Positive (hip dislocating/relocating) → URGENT orthopaedic referral
- **Click** (heard) = Ligamentous (benign, common)
- **If positive Barlow/Ortolani** → USS hips (within 2 weeks), orthopaedic review
- **If risk factors** (breech, FH) → USS hips at 6 weeks even if examination normal

**Galeazzi Sign** (asymmetrical leg length):
- Hips and knees flexed, feet flat on table
- Observe knee heights
- Unequal = Possible DDH (dislocated hip appears shorter)

---

**9. Neurological**:

- Hypertonia (stiff): Cerebral palsy, HIE (hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy)

**Primitive Reflexes** (present at birth, disappear by 3-6 months):
- **Moro reflex** (startle): See above
- **Rooting reflex**: Stroke cheek → Baby turns toward stimulus, opens mouth
- **Sucking reflex**: Put finger/nipple in mouth → Baby sucks
- **Palmar grasp**: Put finger in palm → Baby grasps
- **Stepping reflex**: Hold baby upright, feet touching surface → Baby makes stepping movements

---

  - Displaced laterally = Cardiomegaly
  - Not palpable = Dextrocardia (listen for heart sounds on right side)
- **Heaves**: Left parasternal heave (RV hypertrophy - pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary hypertension)
- **Thrills**: Palpable murmur (significant valve lesion)

**Auscultation** (Warm stethoscope, child calm):

**Listen in 4 areas + axilla + back**:
1. **Aortic area**: 2nd intercostal space, right sternal edge
2. **Pulmonary area**: 2nd intercostal space, left sternal edge
3. **Tricuspid area**: 4th intercostal space, left sternal edge
4. **Mitral area (apex)**: 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line
5. **Axilla**: Radiation of mitral regurgitation

- **Character**: Ejection systolic, pansystolic, early diastolic, mid-diastolic
- **Radiation**: To carotids (aortic stenosis), axilla (mitral regurgitation), back (coarctation)

**Innocent (Flow) Murmurs** (common in children, NO pathology):
- **Features**:
  - **Soft** (grade ≤2/6)
  - **Systolic** (never diastolic)
  - **Asymptomatic** (no symptoms, normal growth, normal examination otherwise)
  - **Varies with position** (louder supine, quieter sitting)
- **Types**:

- **Peripheral pulses**: Dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial (weak in coarctation)

**9. Completion**:
- "I would like to measure blood pressure in all 4 limbs (to rule out coarctation), check oxygen saturations, listen to lung bases (pulmonary oedema), request ECG, CXR, and echocardiogram."

- **Scars**: Thoracotomy (CF, previous surgery)

**Palpation**:
- **Chest expansion**: Place hands on chest, thumbs meet in midline, ask child to take deep breath, observe thumbs moving apart symmetrically
  - Reduced expansion one side = Consolidation, pneumothorax, pleural effusion
- **Trachea**: Central? (not always reliable in children)
- **Tactile vocal fremitus**: Place hand on chest, ask child to say "ninety-nine"
  - Increased = Consolidation
  - Decreased = Pneumothorax, pleural effusion

**Percussion**:
- **Technique**: Percuss from apex to base, compare left and right sides
  - Resonant (normal): Hollow sound
  - **Dull** (consolidation, pleural effusion): Thud sound
  - **Hyperresonant** (pneumothorax, asthma): Increased resonance
- **Young children**: May not tolerate percussion (skip if distressed)

**Auscultation** (Warm stethoscope):

- **Ask child to take deep breaths** (through mouth if old enough, otherwise normal breathing)

**Breath sounds**:
- **Vesicular** (normal): Soft, low-pitched, inspiration > expiration
- **Bronchial breathing** (consolidation): Harsh, high-pitched, inspiration = expiration

## 7. COMMON OSCE STATIONS

### Station 1: 6-Week Baby Check

**Task**: Perform a routine 6-week newborn examination (8 minutes)

**Key Points**:
- Greet parent, wash hands
- Ask: "Any concerns about baby's health, feeding, growth?"
- **Systematic head-to-toe**:
  - **Eyes**: Red reflex (MUST check both)
  - **Mouth**: Palpate palate (feel for posterior cleft)
  - **Heart**: Auscultate 4 areas, check femoral pulses
  - **Hips**: Barlow and Ortolani (do at end, baby calm)
  - **Testes**: Both descended (male)
- "Baby is developing well. No concerns. Hearing screen passed. Next review at 6-8 weeks with GP."

---

### Station 2: Respiratory Examination (Asthma)

**Task**: Examine the respiratory system of this 7-year-old with chronic cough (8 minutes)

**Key Points**:
- General inspection: Well, able to speak full sentences
- Hands: Look for clubbing (CF, bronchiectasis - not expected in asthma)
- Chest: Observe for Harrison's sulci (chronic asthma), recession
- Auscultation: Bilateral expiratory wheeze
- "Findings consistent with asthma. Would like to check peak flow, trial salbutamol, consider spirometry."

---

### Station 3: Cardiovascular Examination (Murmur)

**Task**: Examine the cardiovascular system of this 5-year-old with a murmur (8 minutes)

**Key Points**:
- General inspection: Well, no cyanosis, no respiratory distress
- Hands: No clubbing
- Pulses: Check radial, brachial, femoral (MUST check femoral to exclude coarctation)
- Auscultation: Systematic (4 areas + back)
- Describe murmur: "Ejection systolic murmur, grade 2/6, loudest at pulmonary area, radiates to back, no thrill. Asymptomatic child. Features consistent with innocent pulmonary flow murmur, but would arrange echocardiogram to confirm."

## Summary: Key Takeaways for Paediatric Examination

### 1. Observe Before Touching
- 50% of diagnosis is observation
- Assess ABC, respiratory rate, work of breathing BEFORE detailed examination

### 2. Adapt to Child's Age and Cooperation
- Young children: On parent's lap, start with least distressing
- Older children: Involve them, explain each step
- If child crying: Start with auscultation (before undressing)

### 3. Never Miss the Critical Examinations
- Newborn: Red reflex (both eyes), heart (femoral pulses), hips (Barlow/Ortolani), testes
- Cardiovascular: Femoral pulses (coarctation), murmur character
- Respiratory: Respiratory rate, recession, oxygen saturations

### 4. Recognize Red Flags
- Absent red reflex = Cataract, retinoblastoma → Urgent referral
- Absent/weak femoral pulses = Coarctation → Urgent referral
- Positive Barlow/Ortolani = DDH → Urgent USS + orthopaedic review
- Murmur + symptoms = Pathological → Echocardiogram

### 5. Build Rapport
- Greet child by name, get to eye level
- Use toys, bubbles, distraction
- Warm hands, warm stethoscope
- Make it fun ("Let's listen to your tummy rumbles!")
