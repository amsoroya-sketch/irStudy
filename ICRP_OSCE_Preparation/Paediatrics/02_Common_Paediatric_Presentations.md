## Dr. Amir Soufi's Principle Applied to Paediatric Presentations

> **"In paediatrics, the SAME presentation has DIFFERENT causes at DIFFERENT ages. A febrile neonate is septic until proven otherwise. A febrile toddler with wheeze is bronchiolitis. A febrile school-age child with wheeze is asthma exacerbation. AGE is the most powerful discriminator in your differential. Think: What can cause THIS presentation at THIS age?"**

### The Presentation-Driven Mindset

**Traditional Approach**:
- Child presents with fever
- Take history, examine, investigate
- At end, consider differential
- **Problem**: Delayed recognition of life-threatening conditions, non-systematic approach

**Dr. Amir's Differential-Driven Approach**:
1. **Age + Presentation = Immediate Pattern Recognition**
   - Example: "6-month-old + wheeze + winter" → IMMEDIATE thought: Bronchiolitis (RSV)
   - Example: "3-year-old + barking cough + stridor" → IMMEDIATE thought: Croup
   - Example: "Neonate + jaundice day 2" → IMMEDIATE thought: Physiological vs pathological?

2. **Severity Assessment FIRST (ABC)**
   - Before detailed history: Is this child critically unwell?
   - Airway: Patent? Stridor? Drooling?
   - Breathing: Respiratory rate? Recession? Saturations?
   - Circulation: Capillary refill? Heart rate? Blood pressure?
   - Disability: Alert? Responding? GCS?
   - **Critically unwell → Resuscitation + senior help NOW**

3. **Let Age + Severity Guide Management**
   - Age <3 months + fever → Admission for IV antibiotics (low threshold)
   - Age 6 months + bronchiolitis + saturations 94% → Observe, likely discharge
   - Age 6 months + bronchiolitis + saturations 88% → Admission for oxygen

## 1. FEVER IN CHILDREN

### Age-Based Differential Diagnosis

| Age Group | Most Likely | Serious/Life-Threatening | Key Discriminators |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| **Neonate (<28 days)** | **Sepsis** (GBS, E. coli, Listeria) | Meningitis, HSV infection, UTI | ANY fever in neonate = sepsis until proven otherwise |
| **Infant (1-12 months)** | Viral URTI, bronchiolitis, otitis media | UTI, pneumonia, meningitis, Kawasaki disease | Localizing signs? Rash? Immunization status? |
| **Toddler (1-3 years)** | Viral URTI, viral exanthems | Meningococcal septicaemia, Kawasaki disease | Non-blanching rash? Fever >5 days? |
| **School-age (4-12 years)** | Viral URTI, tonsillitis | Appendicitis (if abdominal pain), pneumonia, meningitis | Sore throat? Abdominal pain? Headache? |
| **Adolescent (12-18 years)** | Viral URTI, glandular fever (EBV) | Meningitis, pneumonia, septic arthritis | Severe sore throat? Joint pain? |

---

### FEVER WITHOUT FOCUS (No Obvious Source)

**Definition**: Fever ≥38°C with no localizing signs on history or examination

**Age-Specific Management**:

#### Neonate (<28 days) with Fever ≥38°C

**Dr. Amir's Principle**: **"EVERY febrile neonate is septic until proven otherwise. Do not wait. Admit immediately."**

**Why?**:
- Immature immune system
- Non-specific presentation (can deteriorate rapidly)
- High risk of bacterial sepsis (GBS, E. coli, Listeria)

**Management (ALL neonates with fever)**:
1. **Admit immediately** to hospital
2. **Full septic screen**:
   - Blood culture (before antibiotics)
   - FBC, CRP
   - Urine MCS (catheter or suprapubic aspiration - NOT bag specimen)
   - Lumbar puncture (if stable) - CSF MCS, glucose, protein, cell count
   - CXR if respiratory signs
3. **IV antibiotics immediately** (within 1 hour):
   - Benzylpenicillin 60 mg/kg IV 12-hourly + Gentamicin 5 mg/kg IV daily
   - If suspected HSV (maternal HSV, vesicles, seizures): Add acyclovir 20 mg/kg IV 8-hourly
4. **Supportive care**: IV fluids, oxygen, NICU/PICU admission
5. **Review cultures at 48-72 hours**: If negative and clinically well, consider stopping antibiotics

**Lumbar Puncture in Neonates**:
- **Contraindications**: Haemodynamically unstable, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, cardiorespiratory compromise
- **If contraindicated**: Start antibiotics, defer LP until stable

---

#### Young Infant (1-3 months) with Fever ≥38°C

**Management** (based on NICE Feverish Child Guidelines):

**Low-risk criteria (Rochester criteria)**:
- Well-appearing, previously healthy, full-term
- No focal infection on examination
- WCC 5-15 × 10⁹/L, normal urinalysis

**If low-risk**:
- Urine MCS (catheter specimen)
- Blood tests (FBC, CRP, blood culture)
- Consider discharge with **24-hour review** if:
  - Parent reliable
  - Access to healthcare
  - No concerns

**If high-risk OR any concerns**:
- **Admit for IV antibiotics** (same as neonate)
- Full septic screen including LP

**Common IMG Mistake**: Discharging febrile infant <3 months without senior review. In Australia, **low threshold for admission** in this age group.

---

#### Older Infant/Child (>3 months) with Fever ≥38°C

**NICE Traffic Light System for Feverish Children**:

| Risk | Features | Management |
|------|----------|------------|
| **GREEN (Low Risk)** | Alert, responsive, smiling, normal feeding, normal hydration, normal colour | Manage at home with safety-net advice, paracetamol/ibuprofen, return if worsens |
| **AMBER (Intermediate)** | Age 3-6 months with fever ≥39°C, reduced activity, dry mucous membranes, fever ≥5 days, nasal flaring | Clinical review within 2-4 hours, consider investigations (urine MCS, bloods), safety-net |
| **RED (High Risk)** | Age <3 months with fever ≥38°C, non-blanching rash, cyanosis, severe respiratory distress, reduced consciousness, bile-stained vomiting, bulging fontanelle, neck stiffness, seizure | **Urgent hospital admission**, investigations, IV antibiotics if sepsis suspected |

**Investigations for Fever Without Focus** (age >3 months):
- **Urine MCS** (catheter or clean catch): UTI is common occult source in infants/toddlers
- **Blood tests** (if unwell or high-risk): FBC, CRP, blood culture
- **CXR** (if respiratory signs): Pneumonia
- **Stool MCS** (if diarrhea): Gastroenteritis

**Empirical Antibiotics** (if sepsis suspected):
- Ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg IV (max 2 g) daily OR
- Cefotaxime 50 mg/kg IV 6-8 hourly
- If meningitis suspected: Add vancomycin (MRSA cover)

---

### KAWASAKI DISEASE

**Dr. Amir's Principle**: **"Fever >5 days in a child? ALWAYS think Kawasaki disease. It's a clinical diagnosis - don't wait for investigations. Early IVIG prevents coronary artery aneurysms."**

**Diagnostic Criteria** (requires ALL):
- **Fever ≥5 days** (essential)
- **PLUS 4 of 5** following:
  1. **Bilateral non-purulent conjunctivitis** (limbic sparing)
  2. **Mucositis**: Strawberry tongue, cracked lips, pharyngeal injection
  3. **Cervical lymphadenopathy** (≥1.5 cm, usually unilateral)
  4. **Polymorphous rash** (maculopapular, erythematous, NO vesicles)
  5. **Extremity changes**: Erythema/oedema of hands/feet (acute), desquamation of fingertips (convalescent, 2-3 weeks)

**Investigations**:
- **Blood**: FBC (↑ platelets after day 7, thrombocytosis 500-1000), ↑ CRP, ↑ ESR, ↓ albumin, ↑ WCC
- **Echocardiogram**: Baseline (coronary artery assessment), repeat at 2 weeks and 6-8 weeks
- **Urine**: Sterile pyuria (WBCs without bacteria)

**Management**:
1. **IVIG** (intravenous immunoglobulin) 2 g/kg over 12 hours (within 10 days of fever onset to prevent coronary artery aneurysms)
2. **High-dose aspirin** 30-50 mg/kg/day (divided QID) until fever settles for 48 hours, THEN low-dose aspirin 3-5 mg/kg/day for 6-8 weeks (antiplatelet)
3. **Cardiology follow-up**: Echo at 2 weeks, 6-8 weeks
4. **Admit** to paediatric ward

**Complications** (if untreated):
- **Coronary artery aneurysms** (25% if untreated, <5% if treated with IVIG)
- Myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, myocarditis

**Common IMG Mistake**: Not considering Kawasaki disease in prolonged fever. Australian guideline: **ANY child with fever >5 days should be screened for Kawasaki disease**.

## 2. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS IN CHILDREN

### Severity Assessment of Respiratory Distress (ALWAYS FIRST)

**Recognize the sick child**: Use **ABCDE approach**

| Feature | Mild | Moderate | Severe | Life-Threatening |
|---------|------|----------|--------|------------------|
| **Respiratory rate** | ↑ for age | Moderate ↑ | Marked ↑ | Exhaustion, ↓ RR |
| **Recession** | None/mild subcostal | Moderate subcostal + intercostal | Severe + suprasternal | Minimal (exhaustion) |
| **Oxygen saturations** | ≥95% | 92-95% | <92% | <90% |
| **Wheeze/stridor** | Mild | Moderate | Severe, audible without stethoscope | Silent chest (life-threatening) |
| **Consciousness** | Alert | Agitated/restless | Drowsy/confused | Unconscious/floppy |
| **Feeding** | Normal | Reduced | Unable to feed | Nil |

**Normal Respiratory Rates by Age**:
- <1 year: 30-40/min
- 1-2 years: 25-35/min
- 2-5 years: 25-30/min
- 5-12 years: 20-25/min
- >12 years: 15-20/min

**Recession**: Subcostal (below ribs), intercostal (between ribs), suprasternal (above sternum), supraclavicular

**Silent chest**: Severely reduced air entry → LIFE-THREATENING (imminent respiratory failure)

---

### BRONCHIOLITIS

**Dr. Amir's Principle**: **"Infant <12 months + wheeze + winter = Bronchiolitis until proven otherwise. It's a clinical diagnosis. No CXR needed unless atypical. Management is SUPPORTIVE - no antibiotics, no salbutamol, no steroids."**

**Epidemiology**:
- Peak age: 3-6 months
- Peak season: Winter (May-September in Australia)
- Causative organism: **RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus)** in 80%

**Clinical Features**:
- **Prodrome**: Coryzal symptoms (runny nose, cough) for 1-2 days
- **Progressive**: Wheeze, crackles, feeding difficulty, respiratory distress
- **Examination**: Wheeze, fine crackles (bilateral), subcostal/intercostal recession, tachypnoea
- **Apnoea**: Risk in very young infants (<6 weeks), ex-prems

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- Viral-induced wheeze / first episode wheeze
- Pneumonia (focal signs, high fever, unilateral crackles)
- Asthma (rare <12 months, consider if atopic history, response to salbutamol)
- Heart failure (structural heart disease, hepatomegaly, poor feeding from birth)
- Foreign body aspiration (sudden onset, unilateral wheeze, choking episode)

**Investigations**:
- **NONE needed if typical presentation**
- **Consider CXR if**: Atypical (focal signs, persistent high fever), severe distress, O₂ sats not improving
- **Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA)**: RSV PCR (if needed for cohorting in hospital, NOT for diagnosis)
- **Blood tests**: NOT routinely needed

**Management**:

**Mild (Majority - 90%)**:
- **Supportive care at home**:
  - Ensure adequate hydration (smaller, more frequent feeds)
  - Upright positioning
  - Paracetamol for fever/discomfort
  - Nasal saline drops (clear secretions)
- **Safety-net advice**:
  - Return if: Respiratory distress worsens, unable to feed, fewer wet nappies, drowsy, apnoea

**Moderate-Severe (Admission Criteria)**:
- Age <3 months (high risk of apnoea)
- O₂ saturations <92% in air
- Severe respiratory distress (grunting, severe recession, RR >60-70)
- Feeding <50% of normal intake or clinical dehydration
- Apnoea (witnessed or reported)
- Pre-existing condition (chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, immunodeficiency)
- Social concerns (parent unable to cope, distance from hospital)

**Hospital Management**:
1. **Oxygen**: If sats <92%, aim for ≥92% (humidified, via nasal prongs or head box)
2. **Fluids**: NG feeds or IV fluids if unable to feed
3. **Monitoring**: Continuous pulse oximetry, apnoea monitoring if <6 weeks
4. **Supportive**: Nasal suction (if needed), upright positioning

**What NOT to do** (No evidence of benefit):
- ❌ Antibiotics (unless secondary bacterial pneumonia)
- ❌ Salbutamol (ineffective in bronchiolitis)
- ❌ Steroids (ineffective)
- ❌ Adrenaline nebulizers (no benefit)
- ❌ Hypertonic saline (controversial, not routine in Australia)

**Natural History**:
- Peak severity: Day 3-5
- Total duration: 7-10 days (cough may persist 3-4 weeks)

**Common IMG Mistake**: Prescribing salbutamol or antibiotics for bronchiolitis. Australian guidelines: **Supportive care ONLY**. If child improves with salbutamol, diagnosis is viral-induced wheeze, NOT bronchiolitis.

---

### CROUP (Laryngotracheobronchitis)

**Dr. Amir's Principle**: **"Barking cough + inspiratory stridor + age 6 months to 3 years = Croup. Give dexamethasone (single dose) to ALL children - it reduces admission rates. If severe stridor at rest, give nebulized adrenaline and observe."**

**Epidemiology**:
- Age: 6 months - 3 years (peak 2 years)
- Cause: Parainfluenza virus (most common), RSV, adenovirus
- Season: Autumn/winter

**Clinical Features**:
- **Prodrome**: URTI symptoms for 1-2 days
- **Classic triad**:
  1. **Barking cough** ("seal-like")
  2. **Inspiratory stridor**
  3. **Hoarse voice**
- **Worse at night**: Symptoms often peak at night
- **Examination**: Stridor (inspiratory), barking cough, NO drooling, child not toxic-appearing

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- **Epiglottitis** (RARE post-Hib vaccine): Drooling, sitting forward, high fever, toxic appearance, **DO NOT examine throat**
- **Bacterial tracheitis** (RARE): High fever, toxic, purulent secretions, may need intubation
- **Foreign body**: Sudden onset, unilateral wheeze, witnessed choking
- **Anaphylaxis**: Sudden onset, urticaria, angioedema, exposure history

**Severity Assessment** (Westley Croup Score - simplified):

| Severity | Stridor | Recession | Air Entry | Consciousness |
|----------|---------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Mild** | None at rest (only when agitated) | None/mild | Normal | Normal |
| **Moderate** | At rest | Moderate | Reduced | Normal |
| **Severe** | At rest, loud | Severe | Markedly reduced | Agitated/drowsy |

**Investigations**:
- **NONE needed** (clinical diagnosis)
- **Do NOT order**: CXR (not helpful, "steeple sign" insensitive), lateral neck X-ray (delays treatment)

**Management**:

**ALL children with croup**:
- **Dexamethasone** 0.15 mg/kg PO (max 8 mg) **SINGLE DOSE**
  - Reduces admission rates, symptom duration
  - Given even for mild croup
  - Alternatives: Prednisolone 1 mg/kg PO OR budesonide 2 mg nebulized (if vomiting)

**Mild croup** (no stridor at rest):
- Dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg PO
- **Discharge home** with safety-net advice
- Return if: Stridor at rest, unable to drink, drowsy, increased work of breathing

**Moderate-Severe croup** (stridor at rest):
- Dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg PO
- **Nebulized adrenaline** (1:1000) 5 mL nebulized with oxygen
  - Rapid onset (within 10 minutes), lasts 2 hours
  - **Observe for 2-4 hours** (rebound possible)
- If improves and stable after 2-4 hours → Discharge
- If worsens or no improvement → **Admit**

**Severe/Life-Threatening** (exhaustion, cyanosis, drowsy):
- **Senior help + anaesthetist**
- High-flow oxygen
- Nebulized adrenaline
- IV dexamethasone (if unable to take PO)
- Prepare for **intubation** (if imminent respiratory failure)
- **PICU admission**

**Common IMG Mistake**: Not giving dexamethasone to mild croup. Australian guideline: **ALL children with croup should receive dexamethasone** (reduces symptom duration and admission rates).

---

### ASTHMA EXACERBATION

**Dr. Amir's Principle**: **"School-age child + wheeze + triggers (viral URTI, exercise, allergen) = Asthma. Assess severity FIRST (mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening). Give salbutamol, ipratropium, steroids. If life-threatening, call for help and prepare for ICU."**

**Asthma Triggers**:
- Viral URTI (most common)
- Allergens (pollen, dust mite, pets)
- Exercise
- Cold air
- Smoke exposure

**Severity Assessment** (APLS - Advanced Paediatric Life Support):

| Feature | Mild-Moderate | Severe | Life-Threatening |
|---------|---------------|--------|------------------|
| **Ability to speak** | Sentences | Words only | Unable to speak |
| **Respiratory rate** | <30/min (>5 years) | >30/min (>5 years) | Fatigue, exhaustion |
| **Heart rate** | <120 bpm (>5 years) | >120 bpm (>5 years) | Bradycardia |
| **O₂ saturations** | ≥92% | <92% | <90% |
| **Wheeze** | Moderate | Loud, throughout chest | Silent chest |
| **Peak flow** | >50% predicted | 33-50% predicted | <33% predicted |
| **Consciousness** | Alert | Agitated | Drowsy, confused, unconscious |

**Silent chest**: Severely reduced air entry due to poor air movement → **LIFE-THREATENING**

**Investigations**:
- **Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR)**: If child >5 years and cooperative (% of predicted)
- **O₂ saturations**: Continuous monitoring
- **CXR**: NOT routine (only if pneumothorax suspected, severe/atypical)
- **Blood gas**: If life-threatening (normal/high CO₂ = respiratory failure)

**Management** (Australian Asthma Handbook 2024):

**Mild-Moderate Exacerbation**:
1. **Salbutamol** (β₂-agonist):
   - **MDI + spacer** (preferred in ED): 6 puffs (600 mcg), repeat every 20 minutes PRN
   - **Nebulized** (if severe): 2.5-5 mg nebulized with oxygen, repeat every 20 minutes
2. **Ipratropium bromide** (anticholinergic):
   - Add if moderate-severe: 250 mcg nebulized with salbutamol (or 8 puffs via MDI + spacer)
3. **Oral steroids**:
   - Prednisolone 1 mg/kg PO (max 50 mg) OR
   - Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg PO (max 16 mg) - single dose, alternative if vomiting
4. **Oxygen**: If sats <92%, aim for ≥94%

**If improves after 1 hour**:
- **Discharge home** with:
  - Salbutamol MDI + spacer (continue 4-6 hourly for 24-48 hours)
  - Oral steroids (3-5 day course)
  - Asthma action plan
  - GP follow-up in 2-7 days

**Severe Exacerbation**:
1. **Call senior help**
2. **High-flow oxygen** (via face mask, aim sats ≥94%)
3. **Continuous nebulized salbutamol** (2.5-5 mg continuously or back-to-back)
4. **Ipratropium bromide** 250 mcg nebulized (with salbutamol)
5. **IV hydrocortisone** 4 mg/kg (max 100 mg) if unable to take PO, OR oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg
6. **Magnesium sulfate** 40 mg/kg IV over 20 minutes (max 2 g) - bronchodilator
7. **Admit to hospital** (high-dependency unit or PICU if life-threatening)

**Life-Threatening Exacerbation**:
1. **IMMEDIATE senior help + anaesthetist**
2. **High-flow oxygen** 100%
3. **Continuous nebulized salbutamol + ipratropium**
4. **IV hydrocortisone** 4 mg/kg
5. **IV magnesium sulfate** 40 mg/kg over 20 minutes
6. **IV salbutamol infusion** (if not responding)
7. **Consider**: IV aminophylline (loading dose 5 mg/kg over 20 min, then infusion)
8. **Prepare for intubation** (if deteriorating, rising CO₂, exhaustion)
9. **PICU admission**

**Common IMG Mistake**: Not giving steroids early in moderate-severe asthma exacerbation. Australian guideline: **Oral steroids should be given within 1 hour** for moderate-severe exacerbations (reduces admission, speeds recovery).

---

## 3. GASTROENTERITIS AND DEHYDRATION

**Dr. Amir's Principle**: **"Gastroenteritis kills through dehydration, not infection. Assess hydration status FIRST. Oral rehydration is first-line. Only use IV if severe dehydration or unable to tolerate oral. Ondansetron helps oral rehydration."**

**Definition**: Vomiting and/or diarrhea, usually viral (rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus)

**Causes by Age**:
- Infant: Rotavirus (less common post-vaccination), norovirus, bacterial (Salmonella, Campylobacter if bloody)
- Older child: Norovirus, bacterial (if foreign travel, bloody diarrhea)

---

### DEHYDRATION ASSESSMENT (CRITICAL)

**Clinical Assessment of Dehydration** (WHO):

| Clinical Sign | No Dehydration | Some Dehydration (3-5%) | Severe Dehydration (≥5%) |
|---------------|----------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Appearance** | Alert, well | Restless, irritable, **sunken eyes** | Lethargic, floppy, drowsy, **very sunken eyes** |
| **Thirst** | Drinks normally | Eager to drink, **thirsty** | Unable to drink |
| **Skin turgor** | Normal | **Reduced** (skin slowly returns) | **Skin tenting** (skin very slowly returns) |
| **Mucous membranes** | Moist | Dry | Very dry |
| **Tears** | Present | Reduced | Absent |
| **Urine output** | Normal | Reduced | Minimal/none |
| **Capillary refill** | <2 sec | 2-3 sec | >3 sec |
| **Heart rate** | Normal | Tachycardia | Marked tachycardia |
| **Fontanelle** (if infant) | Normal | Sunken | Very sunken |

**CRITICAL ASSESSMENT**:
- **Sunken eyes** = Moderate dehydration (3-5%)
- **Skin tenting** = Severe dehydration (≥5%)
- **Reduced consciousness** = Severe dehydration, shock

**Common IMG Mistake**: Assessing dehydration by urine output alone. Australian guideline: **Use multiple clinical signs** (eyes, skin turgor, mucous membranes, behaviour) to assess dehydration.

---

### MANAGEMENT OF GASTROENTERITIS

**Principles**:
1. **Assess dehydration** (no, some, severe)
2. **Oral rehydration first-line** (unless severe dehydration or shocked)
3. **Ondansetron** facilitates oral rehydration
4. **No antibiotics** (unless specific indication)
5. **No anti-motility agents** (loperamide contraindicated in children)

---

#### NO DEHYDRATION

**Management**:
- **Continue normal diet** (including milk - do NOT withhold)
- **Increase fluids**: Encourage oral fluids (water, breastmilk, formula)
- **Oral rehydration solution (ORS)**: Gastrolyte, Hydralyte (optional, not essential if tolerating normal fluids)
- **Antiemetics**: Consider ondansetron if vomiting prevents oral intake (see below)
- **Safety-net advice**:
  - Return if: Increased vomiting, bloody diarrhea, reduced urine output, drowsy, sunken eyes, unable to keep fluids down

**Discharge home**

---

#### SOME DEHYDRATION (3-5%)

**Management**:
- **Oral rehydration therapy (ORT)**:
  - **Gastrolyte** or **Hydralyte** (oral rehydration solution)
  - Give **50 mL/kg over 4 hours** (in addition to usual fluids)
  - Example: 10 kg child → 500 mL over 4 hours (125 mL/hour)
  - **Frequent small sips** (5 mL every 5 minutes, gradually increase)

- **Ondansetron** (if vomiting):
  - **Dose**: Weight-based
    - 8-15 kg: 2 mg PO (wafer or oral solution)
    - 15-30 kg: 4 mg PO
    - >30 kg: 8 mg PO
  - **Single dose**, repeat once after 8 hours if needed
  - **Evidence**: Reduces vomiting, increases success of oral rehydration, reduces IV fluid use and admission

- **Reassess after 4 hours**:
  - If improved (alert, drinking, passing urine) → Continue ORT at home, normal diet
  - If not improving or worsening → Consider IV fluids, admission

**Common IMG Mistake**: Not using ondansetron in vomiting child. Australian guideline (RCH): **Ondansetron is recommended** for vomiting children to facilitate oral rehydration (reduces admission rates).

---

#### SEVERE DEHYDRATION (≥5%) OR SHOCKED

**Management**:
- **URGENT**: This is a medical emergency
- **IV fluid resuscitation**:
  - **0.9% saline** 20 mL/kg bolus over 10-20 minutes
  - Reassess, repeat if needed (up to 60 mL/kg total)
  - Once stable, maintenance IV fluids + deficit replacement over 24-48 hours
- **Senior review**
- **Investigations**:
  - **Blood**: U&E (hypo/hypernatraemia?), glucose, VBG (if shocked)
  - **Urine**: MCS (if fever, rule out UTI)
  - **Stool**: MCS (if bloody diarrhea, if needed for public health notification)
- **Admit** to hospital

**Maintenance IV Fluids** (4-2-1 rule):
- 4 mL/kg/hr for first 10 kg
- 2 mL/kg/hr for next 10 kg
- 1 mL/kg/hr for each kg over 20 kg
- Example: 15 kg child → (4×10) + (2×5) = 40 + 10 = **50 mL/hr maintenance**

---

### RED FLAGS in Gastroenteritis

**Admit if**:
- Severe dehydration or shock
- Unable to tolerate oral fluids despite ondansetron
- Red flag symptoms:
  - **Bile-stained (green) vomiting** → Bowel obstruction/malrotation
  - **Bloody diarrhea + severe abdominal pain** → Intussusception, HUS
  - **Abdominal distension + not passing stool** → Obstruction
  - **Drowsy, reduced consciousness** → Severe dehydration, shock
  - **Age <3 months** → Low threshold for admission
  - **Immunocompromised** → Risk of severe infection

---

## 4. RASHES IN CHILDREN

**Dr. Amir's Principle**: **"The FIRST question for ANY rash: Does it blanch? Non-blanching = meningococcal septicaemia until proven otherwise. Give IM/IV benzylpenicillin and blue-light to hospital IMMEDIATELY."**

### GLASS TEST (Blanching vs Non-Blanching)

**How to perform**:
1. Press a clear glass firmly against the rash
2. Observe:
   - **Blanches** (disappears with pressure) = Capillaries compressed, blood flow stopped temporarily → SAFE
   - **Non-blanching** (stays visible with pressure) = Blood leaked into skin (purpura/petechiae) → **DANGEROUS**

---

### NON-BLANCHING RASH = EMERGENCY

**Meningococcal Septicaemia**:
- Causative organism: *Neisseria meningitidis*
- Presentation: Fever, non-blanching petechial/purpuric rash, headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, vomiting, drowsiness, **rapid deterioration**
- **Rash**: Starts as blanching (erythematous, maculopapular), progresses to **non-blanching** petechiae, then purpura (larger >2 mm)
- **Distribution**: Starts on peripheries (hands, feet), spreads centrally

**IMMEDIATE MANAGEMENT** (pre-hospital):
1. **IM/IV benzylpenicillin** IMMEDIATELY (do NOT wait for hospital):
   - <1 year: 300 mg
   - 1-9 years: 600 mg
   - ≥10 years: 1200 mg
2. **Call ambulance** (blue light to hospital)
3. **Do NOT delay** for LP or investigations

**Hospital Management**:
1. **Paediatric Sepsis 6** (within 1 hour):
   - High-flow oxygen
   - IV/IO access, bloods (FBC, CRP, lactate, blood cultures, coagulation)
   - IV antibiotics (ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg)
   - IV fluid resuscitation (20 mL/kg bolus, repeat PRN)
   - Senior clinician involvement
   - Consider inotropes (if shock despite fluids)
2. **PICU admission**
3. **LP** (if stable, often deferred if shocked/coagulopathy)
4. **Public health notification** (contact tracing, prophylaxis for close contacts)

**Complications**:
- Death (10%)
- Limb loss (ischaemic necrosis from DIC)
- Multi-organ failure
- Hearing loss, neurological sequelae (if meningitis)

**Prophylaxis for Close Contacts**:
- Ciprofloxacin (single dose) OR rifampicin (2 days)
- Household contacts, kissing contacts

### BLANCHING RASHES (Viral Exanthems)

| Disease | Rash Description | Prodrome | Associated Features | Complications |
|---------|------------------|----------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Measles** | Maculopapular, starts face → spreads down, confluent, blanching | 3-5 days: **3 Cs** (Cough, Coryza, Conjunctivitis), high fever | **Koplik spots** (white spots on buccal mucosa, pathognomonic), lymphadenopathy | Pneumonia, encephalitis, SSPE, death (1 in 5000) |
| **Rubella** | Pink maculopapular, starts face → spreads down, fine, blanching | Mild fever, malaise | Lymphadenopathy (post-auricular, suboccipital, cervical), arthralgia (older children/adults) | Congenital rubella (if pregnant contact), arthritis |
| **Roseola infantum** (HHV-6) | Diffuse maculopapular, blanching, appears **AFTER fever settles** | High fever 3-5 days (39-40°C), irritability | **Fever then rash** (diagnostic), febrile convulsion common | Usually self-limiting |
| **Scarlet fever** (Group A Strep) | Diffuse erythematous "sandpaper" rash, blanching, spares face (circumoral pallor), **strawberry tongue**, **desquamation** of hands/feet after 1-2 weeks | Sore throat, fever, headache | Tonsillitis/pharyngitis, **strawberry tongue** (white coating, then red with prominent papillae) | Rheumatic fever, post-strep glomerulonephritis |
| **Hand-foot-mouth disease** (Coxsackie A16, Enterovirus 71) | **Vesicular** rash on **palms, soles**, buttocks; **mouth ulcers** | Mild fever, reduced oral intake | Painful mouth ulcers (tongue, buccal mucosa), irritability, drooling | Usually self-limiting, rarely encephalitis (Enterovirus 71) |
| **Chickenpox** (Varicella) | **Vesicular** rash (starts as macules → papules → vesicles → crusts), **crops** (different stages), starts trunk → spreads peripherally, **very itchy** | 1-2 days: Fever, malaise | Lesions in different stages (diagnostic), oral ulcers | Secondary bacterial infection (impetigo), pneumonia, encephalitis |
| **Slapped cheek syndrome** (Parvovirus B19, Fifth disease) | **Phase 1**: "Slapped cheek" (bright red cheeks), **Phase 2**: Lacy reticular rash on trunk/limbs, blanching | Mild fever, malaise | Rash may recur with heat/exercise, arthralgia (older children/adults) | Aplastic crisis (if chronic haemolytic anaemia), hydrops fetalis (if pregnant) |

### MANAGEMENT OF VIRAL EXANTHEMS

**General Principles**:
- **Most are self-limiting** (supportive care only)
- **Paracetamol/ibuprofen** for fever/discomfort
- **Hydration**
- **Isolate** (prevent spread to others)
- **Safety-net**: Return if non-blanching rash, respiratory distress, drowsy, unable to drink

**Measles**:
- **Notifiable disease** (public health notification)
- Supportive care
- Vitamin A supplementation (if malnourished, immunocompromised)
- Isolate (highly contagious)
- Contact tracing

**Scarlet fever**:
- **Antibiotic**: Penicillin V 250-500 mg PO TDS for 10 days (or azithromycin if allergic)
- **Notifiable** (in some states)
- Prevents rheumatic fever

**Chickenpox**:
- **Supportive**: Paracetamol (NOT ibuprofen - may increase necrotizing fasciitis risk), calamine lotion, cool baths
- **Antihistamines**: Chlorphenamine (if very itchy)
- **Acyclovir**: If immunocompromised, neonatal, severe
- **Isolate**: Until all lesions crusted (5-7 days)

## 5. SEIZURES IN CHILDREN

**Dr. Amir's Principle**: **"First seizure in a febrile child aged 6 months to 5 years = Febrile convulsion (most common). But ALWAYS rule out meningitis first. If afebrile seizure, think epilepsy, head injury, hypoglycaemia, or metabolic cause."**

### FEBRILE CONVULSION

**Definition**: Seizure occurring in child aged **6 months to 5 years** (peak 12-18 months) associated with **fever** (≥38°C), with **NO CNS infection or other cause**

**Epidemiology**:
- 3-5% of children have at least one febrile convulsion
- Peak age: 12-18 months
- Family history common (genetic predisposition)

**Types**:

| Type | Features | Recurrence Risk | Risk of Epilepsy |
|------|----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Simple febrile convulsion** (80%) | Generalized tonic-clonic, <15 minutes, single episode in 24 hours, no focal features, rapid recovery | 30-40% | 1-2% (same as general population) |
| **Complex febrile convulsion** (20%) | Focal features, >15 minutes, multiple episodes in 24 hours, or prolonged post-ictal phase | Higher | 4-12% |

**Differential Diagnosis** (ALWAYS consider):
1. **Meningitis/Encephalitis**: Fever + seizure + neck stiffness/drowsiness/petechial rash
2. **Epilepsy**: Afebrile seizure, recurrent seizures
3. **Hypoglycaemia**: BGL <3 mmol/L (check immediately)
4. **Electrolyte imbalance**: Hypo/hypernatraemia (recent diarrhea/vomiting?)
5. **Head injury**: Recent trauma
6. **Poisoning**: Accidental ingestion

---

### MANAGEMENT OF FEBRILE CONVULSION

**During Seizure** (if witnessed):
1. **Protect child**: Move from danger, cushion head, do NOT restrain
2. **Airway**: Place in recovery position (if possible), do NOT put anything in mouth
3. **Time seizure**: Note start time
4. **Oxygen**: If available
5. **If seizure >5 minutes**:
   - Give **buccal midazolam** 0.5 mg/kg (or rectal diazepam 0.5 mg/kg)
   - Call ambulance

**Post-Seizure (in ED/GP)**:

**History**:
- Seizure description (generalized vs focal, duration, single vs multiple, post-ictal recovery)
- Fever onset and source
- Recent illness, contacts
- Developmental history
- Family history of febrile convulsions or epilepsy

**Examination**:
- **Rule out meningitis**: Neck stiffness, Kernig's/Brudzinski's signs, bulging fontanelle, petechial rash, drowsiness
- Identify source of fever: ENT examination, chest, abdomen
- Neurological examination: Tone, reflexes, GCS (should be normal after recovery)

**Investigations** (NOT routine for simple febrile convulsion):
- **NONE needed** if:
  - Simple febrile convulsion (generalized, <15 minutes, single)
  - Identifies source of fever
  - Child fully recovered
  - No meningism signs

- **Consider investigations if**:
  - **Age <18 months**: LP (to rule out meningitis - clinical signs unreliable at this age)
  - **Meningism signs**: LP, blood culture, FBC, CRP
  - **Complex features**: EEG, neuroimaging (CT/MRI brain)
  - **Recurrent or prolonged**: U&E, glucose, calcium, magnesium

**Lumbar Puncture Indications**:
- Clinical signs of meningitis (neck stiffness, drowsy, petechiae)
- Age <18 months (meningitis signs unreliable)
- Prolonged post-ictal drowsiness
- Complex febrile convulsion

**Management**:
- **Treat fever source** (e.g., antibiotics for otitis media)
- **Antipyretics**: Paracetamol 15 mg/kg, ibuprofen 10 mg/kg (for comfort, does NOT prevent recurrence)
- **Parental education**:
  - Febrile convulsions do NOT cause brain damage
  - Recurrence risk 30-40% (higher if <18 months, family history, low-grade fever)
  - What to do if seizure recurs (recovery position, time, call ambulance if >5 min)
  - **No evidence** that antipyretics prevent recurrence
- **Discharge** (if simple febrile convulsion, well, no meningism)

**Common IMG Mistake**: Performing LP on every child with febrile convulsion. Australian guideline: **LP NOT routine for simple febrile convulsion** (only if meningism or age <18 months).

---

### STATUS EPILEPTICUS

**Definition**: Continuous seizure >5 minutes OR recurrent seizures without recovery between episodes

**Management** (APLS Protocol):

**0-5 minutes**:
- Airway, breathing, circulation
- High-flow oxygen
- Protect from injury
- Time seizure

**5-10 minutes** (if seizure continues):
- **Buccal midazolam** 0.5 mg/kg (max 10 mg) OR
- **IV lorazepam** 0.1 mg/kg (if IV access)

**10-20 minutes** (if seizure continues after first dose):
- Repeat **buccal midazolam** 0.5 mg/kg OR **IV lorazepam** 0.1 mg/kg
- Call senior help
- Check **BGL** (give IV dextrose if hypoglycaemic)

**20-40 minutes** (if seizure continues after second dose):
- **IV phenytoin** 20 mg/kg over 20 minutes (cardiac monitoring) OR
- **IV levetiracetam** 40 mg/kg over 5 minutes
- Prepare for **PICU transfer**

**>40 minutes** (refractory status):
- **Intubation and ventilation**
- **Thiopentone** or **midazolam infusion**
- **PICU admission**

## 6. FAILURE TO THRIVE (FTT)

**Dr. Amir's Principle**: **"Failure to thrive is NOT a diagnosis - it's a symptom. The differential is HUGE: inadequate intake (poverty, neglect, feeding difficulty), inadequate absorption (coeliac, CF), or increased losses (chronic diarrhea, diabetes). Plot on growth chart. If crossing centiles downward = organic cause more likely."**

**Definition**: Inadequate weight gain or weight loss in a child, resulting in weight **crossing 2 or more centile lines downward** on growth chart

**Classification**:
1. **Organic** (30%): Medical cause (GI, cardiac, renal, metabolic, chromosomal)
2. **Non-organic** (50%): Psychosocial (inadequate feeding, poverty, neglect, maternal depression)
3. **Mixed** (20%): Both organic and non-organic

---

### DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF FAILURE TO THRIVE

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Inadequate Intake** | Poverty/food insecurity, neglect, incorrect formula preparation, breastfeeding difficulty, oral-motor dysfunction (cerebral palsy), cleft palate |
| **Inadequate Absorption** | Coeliac disease, cystic fibrosis, cow's milk protein allergy, chronic diarrhea, short gut syndrome |
| **Increased Losses** | Chronic diarrhea, vomiting (GORD, pyloric stenosis), diabetes (polyuria) |
| **Increased Metabolic Demand** | Congenital heart disease (high energy expenditure), chronic lung disease, hyperthyroidism, malignancy |
| **Chromosomal/Genetic** | Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome |
| **Chronic Infection** | HIV, TB, recurrent UTIs |

---

### ASSESSMENT OF FAILURE TO THRIVE

**History**:
- **Feeding history** (DETAILED):
  - Breastfed or formula? If formula: type, preparation (dilution?), volume, frequency
  - Solids introduced? Types, frequency, acceptance
  - **24-hour dietary recall**: "Tell me everything [child] ate and drank yesterday from wake-up to bedtime"
  - Feeding difficulties: Choking, gagging, vomiting, refusing food
- **GI symptoms**: Vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain
- **Respiratory**: Chronic cough, wheeze, recurrent infections (CF?)
- **Urinary**: Polyuria, polydipsia (diabetes?)
- **Development**: Milestones (global delay suggests chromosomal/genetic)
- **Birth history**: Prematurity, birth weight, NICU stay
- **Family history**: Coeliac, CF, short stature (familial?)
- **Social history**: Who feeds child? Financial difficulties? Maternal mental health? Safeguarding concerns?

**Examination**:
- **Growth parameters**:
  - **Plot on growth chart**: Weight, height, head circumference (all 3!)
  - **Calculate weight-for-length**: Low in acute malnutrition
  - **Mid-parental height**: Expected adult height based on parents' heights
- **General**: Wasted appearance, muscle bulk, subcutaneous fat, skin (dry, eczema)
- **Systemic**: Cardiac (murmur?), respiratory (crackles?), abdominal (organomegaly, masses), dysmorphic features

**Investigations** (guided by history/examination):
- **Initial screen**:
  - FBC (anaemia?), iron studies
  - U&E, LFTs
  - Coeliac serology (anti-tTG IgA + total IgA)
  - Urine MCS (UTI?)
  - Stool MCS (chronic diarrhea)
- **Second-line** (if indicated):
  - Sweat test (CF if recurrent chest infections, steatorrhoea)
  - Thyroid function (hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism)
  - Chromosome analysis (if dysmorphic)
  - HIV serology (if risk factors)

---

### MANAGEMENT OF FAILURE TO THRIVE

**Non-Organic (Psychosocial)**:
- **Multidisciplinary approach**: Paediatrician, dietitian, social worker, community nurse
- **Increase caloric intake**:
  - Frequent small meals, high-calorie foods
  - Fortify feeds (add extra formula powder, butter, cream to foods)
- **Address social factors**: Food insecurity, parental mental health, parenting support
- **Safeguarding**: If neglect suspected, involve child protection
- **Regular follow-up**: Weekly weight checks, growth monitoring

**Organic**:
- **Treat underlying cause**:
  - Coeliac disease → Gluten-free diet
  - CF → Pancreatic enzyme replacement, high-calorie diet
  - Heart failure → Treat cardiac condition, fortified feeds
- **Nutritional support**: High-calorie feeds, NG tube feeding (if severe)
- **Specialist referral**: Gastroenterology, cardiology, endocrinology (as needed)

**Admission Criteria**:
- Severe malnutrition (weight <3rd centile, wasted)
- Safeguarding concerns
- Failed outpatient management
- Need for NG tube feeding initiation

---

## 7. NEONATAL JAUNDICE

**Dr. Amir's Principle**: **"Jaundice in the first 24 hours is ALWAYS pathological (haemolysis, sepsis). Jaundice days 2-14 is usually physiological, but check bilirubin. Prolonged jaundice >14 days (term) or >21 days (preterm) needs investigation for biliary atresia (pale stools + dark urine = biliary obstruction)."**

**Physiology**: Neonatal jaundice due to:
- Increased RBC breakdown (high haematocrit)
- Immature liver (reduced conjugation)
- Increased enterohepatic circulation

---

### CLASSIFICATION BY TIMING

| Timing | Classification | Causes | Management |
|--------|---------------|--------|------------|
| **<24 hours** | **PATHOLOGICAL** (ALWAYS) | **Haemolysis** (ABO/Rh incompatibility, G6PD deficiency), **sepsis**, congenital infection | Urgent investigation (bilirubin, FBC, blood group, Coombs test, septic screen), phototherapy, exchange transfusion if severe |
| **24 hours - 14 days** | Physiological (most common) OR pathological | Physiological jaundice (peaks day 3-5), breastfeeding jaundice, sepsis, haemolysis | Check bilirubin level, plot on nomogram, phototherapy if indicated |
| **>14 days (term) or >21 days (preterm)** | **PROLONGED** | Breast milk jaundice (benign), **biliary atresia** (surgical emergency), hypothyroidism, UTI, haemolysis | Investigate: Split bilirubin (conjugated vs unconjugated), LFTs, TFTs, urine MCS, USS liver. **If conjugated >20%: urgent surgical referral for biliary atresia** |

---

### CAUSES OF NEONATAL JAUNDICE

**Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinaemia** (most common):
- Physiological jaundice (peaks day 3-5, resolves by day 14)
- Breastfeeding jaundice (inadequate intake, dehydration)
- Breast milk jaundice (substances in breast milk inhibit conjugation, benign, can last weeks)
- Haemolysis (ABO/Rh incompatibility, G6PD deficiency, spherocytosis)
- Polycythaemia (twin-twin transfusion, maternal diabetes)
- Cephalhaematoma (blood reabsorption)
- Sepsis
- Hypothyroidism
- Crigler-Najjar syndrome (rare)

**Conjugated Hyperbilirubinaemia** (ALWAYS pathological):
- **Biliary atresia** (surgical emergency - Kasai procedure before 8 weeks for best outcome)
- Neonatal hepatitis
- Choledochal cyst
- Congenital infection (TORCH: Toxoplasmosis, Rubella, CMV, HSV)
- Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency
- Galactosaemia

---

### RED FLAGS in Neonatal Jaundice

**URGENT investigation/referral if**:
- Jaundice in **first 24 hours** (haemolysis, sepsis)
- Jaundice **>14 days** (term) or **>21 days** (preterm) - rule out biliary atresia
- **Pale stools + dark urine** = Conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia (biliary obstruction) → URGENT surgical referral
- Unwell baby (poor feeding, lethargy, fever, vomiting)
- Bilirubin level in phototherapy or exchange transfusion range (use nomogram)

---

### INVESTIGATIONS

**Initial**:
- **Serum bilirubin**: Total bilirubin (transcutaneous or serum)
- **Plot on nomogram** (Bhutani chart): Age in hours vs bilirubin level → Determines need for phototherapy
- **FBC**: Haemolysis (anaemia, reticulocytosis), sepsis (WCC)
- **Blood group + Coombs test** (baby and mother): ABO/Rh incompatibility
- **G6PD level**: If jaundice severe or ethnic background (Mediterranean, African, Asian)

**If prolonged jaundice (>14 days)**:
- **Split bilirubin**: Conjugated vs unconjugated
  - **If conjugated >20% of total** → Conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia → **URGENT surgical referral** (biliary atresia)
- **LFTs**, **TFTs** (hypothyroidism), **urine MCS** (UTI)
- **USS liver** (biliary tree, choledochal cyst)
- **Stool colour** (use stool colour chart - pale = biliary obstruction)

---

### MANAGEMENT

**Phototherapy**:
- **Mechanism**: Blue light (wavelength 420-470 nm) converts unconjugated bilirubin to water-soluble isomers (excreted in urine/stool without conjugation)
- **Indications**: Based on **Bhutani nomogram** (age in hours + bilirubin level)
- **Method**: Double phototherapy (lights above and below), eye protection, maximize skin exposure
- **Monitoring**: Bilirubin every 4-6 hours (should fall), hydration, temperature
- **Stop when**: Bilirubin falls below phototherapy threshold

**Exchange Transfusion**:
- **Indications**: Bilirubin in exchange transfusion range (nomogram), acute bilirubin encephalopathy, failed phototherapy
- **Mechanism**: Removes bilirubin and maternal antibodies (if haemolysis)
- **Procedure**: Performed in NICU

**Supportive**:
- **Adequate hydration**: Encourage breastfeeding, consider supplementation if dehydrated
- **Treat underlying cause**: Antibiotics if sepsis

## Common IMG Mistakes Across Paediatric Presentations

### Mistake 1: Not Assessing Severity FIRST

**Problem**: Taking detailed history before recognizing critically unwell child

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Delays life-saving interventions
- Child can deteriorate rapidly in paediatrics

**Correct Approach**:
- **ABCDE assessment FIRST** for any acutely unwell child
- Recognize sick child, call for help, stabilize BEFORE detailed history

---

### Mistake 2: Not Using Age-Appropriate Differentials

**Problem**: Applying adult differential to paediatric presentations

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Misses common paediatric diagnoses (e.g., bronchiolitis in infant, febrile convulsion in toddler)

**Correct Approach**:
- **Age-based differentials** from the start
- Know age-specific common presentations

---

### Mistake 3: Over-investigating Simple Febrile Convulsion

**Problem**: Ordering LP, EEG, neuroimaging for every febrile convulsion

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Causes unnecessary distress, cost
- Australian guideline: **Simple febrile convulsion needs NO investigations**

**Correct Approach**:
- **Simple febrile convulsion (generalized, <15 min, single) = NO investigations** (unless meningism or age <18 months)

---

### Mistake 4: Prescribing Antibiotics/Salbutamol for Bronchiolitis

**Problem**: "This infant has wheeze, I'll give salbutamol and antibiotics"

**Why It's Wrong**:
- No evidence of benefit
- Australian guideline: **Supportive care ONLY** for bronchiolitis

**Correct Approach**:
- Bronchiolitis = Viral → No antibiotics, no salbutamol, no steroids
- If improves with salbutamol → Diagnosis is viral-induced wheeze, NOT bronchiolitis

---

### Mistake 5: Not Using Ondansetron for Gastroenteritis

**Problem**: "Vomiting child, I'll just tell parents to give oral fluids"

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Ondansetron facilitates oral rehydration, reduces admission
- Australian guideline (RCH): **Ondansetron recommended** for vomiting

**Correct Approach**:
- Vomiting preventing oral intake → Give ondansetron (weight-based dose)

---

## Summary: Key Takeaways

### 1. Severity Assessment FIRST (ABCDE)
- Before detailed history: Is this child critically unwell?
- Recognize sick child → Call for help → Stabilize

### 2. Age-Based Differential Thinking
- Same presentation = Different diagnoses at different ages
- Neonate with fever = Sepsis. Infant with wheeze = Bronchiolitis. School-age with wheeze = Asthma.

### 3. Fever Management
- Neonate <28 days with fever ≥38°C → Admit for IV antibiotics (NO exceptions)
- Infant 1-3 months → Low threshold for admission
- Fever >5 days → Think Kawasaki disease

### 4. Respiratory Distress
- Bronchiolitis = Supportive care ONLY (no antibiotics, no salbutamol)
- Croup = Dexamethasone to ALL (reduces admission)
- Asthma = Salbutamol + steroids early

### 5. Dehydration = CLINICAL assessment
- Sunken eyes + reduced skin turgor = Moderate dehydration (3-5%)
- Oral rehydration first-line
- Ondansetron facilitates oral rehydration

### 6. Rashes
- Non-blanching rash = Meningococcal septicaemia → IM benzylpenicillin + blue-light to hospital
- Blanching rash = Viral exanthem (usually self-limiting)

### 7. Seizures
- Febrile convulsion (6 months - 5 years, fever, generalized, <15 min) = NO investigations (unless meningism)
- Status epilepticus >5 min → Buccal midazolam

### 8. Failure to Thrive
- Plot on growth chart (crossing 2 centile lines downward)
- 24-hour dietary recall
- Organic vs non-organic vs mixed

### 9. Neonatal Jaundice
- Jaundice <24 hours = PATHOLOGICAL (investigate urgently)
- Prolonged jaundice >14 days (term) → Check split bilirubin (rule out biliary atresia)
- Pale stools + dark urine = Biliary obstruction → URGENT surgical referral

### 10. Common IMG Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Not assessing severity first
- ❌ Not using age-appropriate differentials
- ❌ Over-investigating simple febrile convulsion
- ❌ Prescribing antibiotics/salbutamol for bronchiolitis
- ❌ Not using ondansetron for vomiting

**Next Steps**:
- Practice ABCDE assessment for sick children
- Learn age-based differentials by heart
- Review Bhutani nomogram for neonatal jaundice
- Practice traffic light system for febrile children

**You're doing great! Keep practicing these presentations and you'll be well-prepared for your ICRP paediatric rotation and OSCE!**
