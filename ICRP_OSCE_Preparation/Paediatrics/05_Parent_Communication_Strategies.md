## Dr. Amir Soufi's Principle Applied to Parent Communication

> **"In paediatrics, you have THREE people in the room: the child, the parent, and you. Each needs your attention. Acknowledge the child first (build rapport, reduces their anxiety), THEN engage the parent. Parents are EXPERTS on their child - listen to them. When discussing concerns, use the sandwich approach: Start POSITIVE (what child does well), discuss CONCERN (specific, clear), end with PLAN (what we'll do). Never dismiss parental concern - 'worried parents are often right'."**

### The Paediatric Communication Mindset

**Traditional Approach**:
- Speak only to parent, ignore child
- Use medical jargon
- Tell parents what to do (paternalistic)
- Dismiss parental concerns ("Don't worry, children develop at different rates")
- **Problem**: Parent feels unheard, child feels excluded, poor rapport, non-adherence to advice

**Effective Paediatric Communication Approach**:
1. **Triangle of Communication**: You ↔ Child ↔ Parent
   - Acknowledge child FIRST (greeting, eye contact, engage)
   - Then engage parent (active listening, empathy, partnership)
   - Throughout: Observe child (behavior, interaction, development)

2. **Parents as Partners**
   - Parents know their child best
   - Shared decision-making (not paternalistic)
   - "What are your thoughts?" "What are you most worried about?"

3. **Plain Language, No Jargon**
   - "Tummy" not "abdomen"
   - "Infection in the urine" not "UTI"
   - "Breathing tube infection" not "LRTI"
   - Check understanding: "Does that make sense?"

4. **Sandwich Approach for Concerns**
   - **Positive first**: "Ethan is developing well in many areas - he's walking, running, and playing beautifully."
   - **Concern**: "I do have some concerns about his speech development. At 2 years, we'd expect him to be joining words together, but he's using single words."
   - **Plan**: "Here's what I'd like to do: arrange a hearing test and refer him to a speech therapist. With support, most children catch up."

5. **Empathy and Validation**
   - "I can see you're worried about this."
   - "That must be really difficult for you."
   - "You're doing a great job bringing her in today."

## The PARENT Framework for Effective Communication

**P - Prepare the environment**
- **Private space**: Consultation room (not hospital corridor)
- **Calm child**: Toys, books, snacks available
- **Time**: Ensure adequate time (don't rush consultation)
- **Seating**: Parent and doctor at same level (not doctor standing, parent sitting - implies hierarchy)

**A - Acknowledge child AND parent**
- **Child first**: "Hello [child's name]! What a beautiful teddy you have!"
- **Then parent**: "And you're [child's] mum/dad? Nice to meet you. What should I call you?"
- **Confirm relationship**: "Are you [child's] parent/carer/guardian?"

**R - Rapport building**
- **Open body language**: Lean forward slightly, nod, smile
- **Eye contact**: With both child and parent (culturally appropriate)
- **Active listening**: "Tell me more about that." "That sounds challenging."
- **Empathy**: "I can understand why you're worried."

**E - Explain clearly (plain language)**
- **Avoid jargon**: Use everyday terms
- **Check understanding**: "Does that make sense?" "Do you have any questions?"
- **Visual aids if helpful**: Draw diagrams, show pictures (e.g., growth chart)
- **Written information**: Handouts, fact sheets (many parents retain only 30% of verbal information)

**N - Negotiate and collaborate (shared decision-making)**
- **Explore parent's ideas, concerns, expectations (ICE)**:
  - "What do you think might be causing [child's] symptoms?"
  - "What are you most worried about?"
  - "What were you hoping I could do today?"
- **Present options**: "There are a few ways we could manage this. Let me explain the options and we can decide together what's best for [child]."
- **Respect autonomy**: Parents have right to decline interventions (unless child safeguarding concern)

**T - Tailored follow-up plan**
- **Clear, specific plan**: "When to return, what to watch for, who to call if worried"
- **Safety-netting**: "Come back if [red flags: fever >3 days, rash, drowsy, not drinking]"
- **Written summary** (if complex): Diagnosis, plan, follow-up
- **Answer questions**: "What questions do you have?" (not "Do you have any questions?" - implies you expect none)

---

## Age-Appropriate Communication with Children

**Involving the child in consultation demonstrates respect, builds rapport, and can provide valuable clinical information**

### Infants (0-12 months)
- **Speak to infant**: Smile, gentle voice ("Hello beautiful baby!")
- **Narrate actions**: "I'm just going to listen to your chest now, [baby's name]"
- **Engage through parent**: "Does [baby] usually smile like this?" (assessing development, building rapport)

### Toddlers (1-3 years)
- **Get to eye level**: Squat or kneel to child's height
- **Use simple language**: "Can I look in your ears?" (not "Perform otoscopy")
- **Offer choices** (when appropriate): "Would you like to sit on mum's lap or on the bed?"
- **Distraction**: Toys, bubbles, singing
- **Praise**: "You're doing so well! What a brave boy/girl!"

### Preschoolers (3-5 years)
- **Simple explanations**: "I'm going to use my special listening tool (stethoscope) to hear your heartbeat"
- **Play and imagination**: "Can you take a BIG breath like you're blowing out birthday candles?"
- **Involve in examination**: "Can you help me count to 10 while I listen to your tummy?"
- **Reassure**: "This won't hurt, just a gentle press"

### School-Age (5-12 years)
- **Direct questions**: "How are you feeling today?" (ask child, not just parent)
- **Explain purpose**: "I'd like to check your breathing to make sure your lungs are working well"
- **Use analogies**: "Your lungs are like balloons that fill with air"
- **Respect modesty**: Offer gown, explain each step before examination

### Adolescents (12-18 years)
- **Direct communication**: Speak TO adolescent (not just parent)
- **Respect autonomy**: "What brings you in today?" (ask adolescent first)
- **Offer confidential time**: "Would it be okay if I speak with [adolescent] alone for part of the consultation?" (ask parent permission first)
- **Confidentiality**: Explain limits ("What we discuss is confidential unless I'm worried about your safety or someone else's safety")
- **Shared decision-making**: "What are your thoughts about treatment options?"

## Difficult Conversations in Paediatrics

### 1. Discussing Developmental Delay or Disability

**Dr. Amir's Principle**: **"Parents often KNOW something is not right before you say it. Don't hide behind euphemisms ('He's just a late bloomer'). Be HONEST but HOPEFUL. Use the word 'concern', give SPECIFIC examples, and ALWAYS offer a PLAN. Never leave parents without next steps."**

#### The Conversation Structure

**Step 1: Set the scene**
- **Private room**, adequate time, both parents present if possible
- **Start with strengths**: "Thank you for bringing Ethan in. I've had a chance to observe him, and he's clearly a happy, engaged little boy with lots of energy."

**Step 2: Express concern clearly**
- **Use "concern" language**: "I do have some concerns about Ethan's development that I'd like to discuss with you."
- **Be specific** (avoid vague statements):
  - ✅ "At 2 years, we'd expect Ethan to be joining two words together, like 'more milk' or 'mummy gone'. He's using single words, which is more typical of an 18-month-old."
  - ❌ "He's a bit delayed" (vague, not helpful)
- **Acknowledge parent's perspective**: "Have you noticed this too?"

**Step 3: Listen to parental response**
- Parents may:
  - **Agree**: "Yes, we've been worried about this too" → Validate ("It's good you've noticed and brought him in")
  - **Deny/minimize**: "But his cousin didn't talk until 3 years and he's fine now" → Empathize but persist ("I understand some children are late talkers, but I think it's important we check Ethan's hearing and get him some support now, rather than waiting")
  - **Become upset**: Allow silence, offer tissue, empathize ("I know this is hard to hear")

**Step 4: Explain what you're concerned about**
- **Use analogy if helpful**: "Development is like building blocks - each stage builds on the previous one. If we support Ethan's speech now, it helps all his other skills too."
- **Avoid labels** at this stage (don't say "autism", "intellectual disability" unless diagnosis confirmed - discuss specific concerns)

**Step 5: Offer a clear plan**
- **Investigations**: "I'd like to arrange a hearing test, because the most common reason for speech delay is hearing difficulties."
- **Referrals**: "I'd also like to refer Ethan to a speech therapist, who can assess him and provide therapy to help his speech develop."
- **Early intervention**: "The great news is that children who get support early often catch up. The earlier we intervene, the better."
- **Follow-up**: "I'd like to see Ethan back in 4 weeks to review progress and discuss the results of his hearing test."

**Step 6: Provide hope and support**
- **Reassure**: "Many children with speech delay catch up with therapy."
- **Empower**: "You're doing the right thing by bringing him in early. This gives Ethan the best chance."
- **Resources**: Provide written information, support group contacts (e.g., Raising Children Network, Down Syndrome Australia, Autism awareness organizations)

**Step 7: Check understanding and answer questions**
- "What questions do you have?"
- "I know this is a lot to take in. Would you like me to write down the plan?"
- "How are you feeling about what we've discussed?"

**Common Parent Reactions and Responses**

| Parent Reaction | How to Respond |
|-----------------|---------------|
| **"But his cousin didn't talk until 3 and he's fine!"** | "I understand some children are late talkers, and every child is different. However, as doctors we follow guidelines based on research, and these guidelines tell us that if a child isn't joining words by 2 years, we should check hearing and offer support. It's better to get support now and not need it, than to wait and miss an opportunity to help." |
| **"Are you saying my child has a disability?"** | "At this stage, I'm saying I have concerns about Ethan's speech development. We need to do some assessments - hearing test, speech therapy assessment - to understand why his speech is delayed. Once we have more information, we'll have a clearer picture. Many children with speech delay don't have a permanent disability - they just need some extra support." |
| **"I don't want him labelled"** | "I understand your concern. We're not labeling Ethan - we're identifying an area where he needs support. The goal is to give him therapy NOW so he can catch up. Without a diagnosis or assessment, we can't access funding for therapy through NDIS, so having a formal assessment actually helps Ethan get the support he needs." |
| **"This is my fault" (guilt)** | "This is absolutely NOT your fault. Developmental delays can happen for many reasons - genetics, hearing difficulties, or sometimes we never find a cause. What matters is that you've brought Ethan in, and we're going to support him and support you. You're being a wonderful parent by seeking help." |

### 2. Discussing Referrals and Investigations

**Why This Is Difficult**: Parents may feel:
- Anxious about specialist opinion ("Is it serious?")
- Concerned about cost/time
- Worried child will be "labelled"

**How to Discuss Referrals**:

**Explain WHY (rationale)**:
- "I'd like to refer Sophie to a paediatrician because [specific reason: prolonged fever, heart murmur, developmental concerns]. A paediatrician specializes in children's health and can do a more detailed assessment."

**Explain WHAT will happen**:
- "The paediatrician will review Sophie's history, examine her, and may arrange some tests [blood tests, ultrasound, X-ray]. Then they'll discuss their findings and recommendations with you."

**Timeline**:
- "In the public system, the wait can be several weeks to months, depending on urgency. If you have private health insurance, you may be seen sooner. I'll write the referral as [routine/urgent/emergency] depending on Sophie's condition."

**Reassure but don't falsely reassure**:
- ✅ "Most children with heart murmurs have innocent murmurs, which are harmless. However, we need the paediatrician to confirm this with an echocardiogram (heart ultrasound)."
- ❌ "Don't worry, it's probably nothing" (dismissive, falsely reassuring)

**Investigations**:
- **Explain in plain language**: "Blood test to check infection markers, kidneys, and blood count"
- **Explain procedure** (especially if invasive): "For the blood test, a nurse will use a small needle to take a sample from a vein in the arm. It might sting briefly. We can use numbing cream beforehand."
- **Address fear**: "I know blood tests can be scary. We'll do everything to make it as comfortable as possible for [child]. You can hold their hand throughout."

---

### 3. Vaccination Hesitancy

**Dr. Amir's Principle**: **"Don't argue or lecture. Vaccination hesitancy comes from FEAR (side effects, overwhelm, misinformation). Address fear with EMPATHY first, then EVIDENCE. Use the CASE approach: Corroborate (their concerns are understandable), About me (I vaccinate my own children), Science (evidence), Explain/Empower (answer questions, provide resources)."**

**Prevalence**: 5-10% of Australian parents have vaccination hesitancy (delaying or refusing vaccines)

---

#### The CASE Approach to Vaccination Hesitancy

**C - Corroborate (Validate concerns)**
- **Listen without judgment**: "Tell me about your concerns with vaccines."
- **Common concerns**:
  - Safety: "I've heard vaccines cause autism"
  - Necessity: "These diseases aren't around anymore, why vaccinate?"
  - Overwhelm: "Too many vaccines, too soon"
  - Natural immunity: "Getting the disease naturally is better"
  - Ingredients: "What's in vaccines? I've heard about mercury/aluminum"

- **Validate** (doesn't mean agree): "I can understand why you're concerned. As parents, we want to protect our children and make the best decisions for them. It's good you're asking questions."

**A - About Me (Personal testimony)**
- **Share (if true)**: "As a doctor and a parent, I've vaccinated my own children according to the Australian immunization schedule. I wouldn't recommend anything I wouldn't do for my own family."
- **If not a parent**: "I've vaccinated hundreds of children, and I've seen how vaccines prevent serious illnesses. I trust the evidence and the Australian immunization program."

**S - Science (Evidence-based information)**

**Address specific concerns with evidence**:

**"Vaccines cause autism"**:
- "I understand this is a major concern for many parents. This fear started with a now-discredited study in 1998 that has been completely disproven. The researcher lost his medical license because he falsified data. Since then, dozens of large studies involving millions of children have shown NO link between vaccines and autism. The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, WHO, and every major medical organization worldwide confirm vaccines do not cause autism."

**"Diseases aren't around anymore, why vaccinate?"**:
- "That's actually BECAUSE of vaccines! Diseases like measles and whooping cough are rare in Australia now because most people are vaccinated. But these diseases still exist - we had measles outbreaks in Australia in recent years in unvaccinated communities. If we stop vaccinating, these diseases will come back. We've seen this happen in other countries where vaccination rates dropped."

**"Too many vaccines, too soon"**:
- "I understand it seems like a lot. But babies' immune systems are incredibly strong - they handle thousands of antigens (foreign substances) every day just from eating, breathing, and touching things. Vaccines contain far fewer antigens than what babies encounter naturally. The schedule is carefully designed to protect babies when they're most vulnerable. For example, whooping cough can be fatal in young babies, so we vaccinate at 2 months."

**"Natural immunity is better"**:
- "You're right that getting the disease can produce immunity. But the risks of getting the disease are far greater than the risks of the vaccine. For example:
  - Measles kills 1 in 5000 children who get it, and causes brain damage in 1 in 1000. The MMR vaccine's serious side effects are extremely rare (1 in a million).
  - Whooping cough can cause babies to stop breathing. The vaccine prevents this without the child suffering from the disease."

**"What about vaccine ingredients like mercury/aluminum?"**:
- "I'm glad you asked. The mercury you may have heard about is thiomersal, which was used as a preservative in multi-dose vials. It's no longer used in childhood vaccines in Australia except in trace amounts in some flu vaccines. Even when it was used, the type of mercury (ethylmercurim) is eliminated from the body quickly, unlike the mercury in fish (methylmercury). Aluminum is used in small amounts to boost the immune response. The amount in vaccines is less than what babies get from breast milk or formula in the first 6 months of life. These ingredients have been extensively studied and are safe."

**E - Explain and Empower (Answer questions, provide resources)**
- "What other questions do you have?"
- "I'd like to give you some reliable resources":
  - Australian Government Immunise Australia website
  - Raising Children Network (raisingchildren.net.au)
  - "The Vaccine Book" by Dr. Barry Bloom (if parents want reading material)
- "Take time to think about it, read the information, and we can discuss again at your next visit."
- **Offer compromise** (if appropriate):
  - "Would you feel more comfortable spacing out vaccines?" (Not evidence-based, but may be acceptable middle ground)
  - "Would you like to start with just one or two vaccines today and see how [child] tolerates them?"

---

**What NOT to Do**:
- ❌ Argue or become confrontational
- ❌ Dismiss concerns ("That's just nonsense")
- ❌ Lecture or use complex medical terminology
- ❌ Force or coerce ("If you don't vaccinate, I won't see your child" - ethically problematic in Australia)
- ❌ Refuse to engage ("Just Google it")

**Document**:
- "Discussed vaccination benefits, risks, and parental concerns. Parent declined [specific vaccine] today. Provided evidence-based information (Immunise Australia website). Will revisit at next consultation. Parent aware of risks of non-vaccination."

---

### 4. Safeguarding Concerns (Child Protection)

**Dr. Amir's Principle**: **"Safeguarding conversations are the HARDEST in paediatrics. Your job is NOT to investigate or prove abuse - it's to protect the child. If you have reasonable concern (injury inconsistent with history, developmental delay with neglect features, disclosure), you MUST notify. Be professional, non-accusatory, and document thoroughly. Say 'I'm required by law' - this removes blame from you."**

---

#### When to Consider Safeguarding Concerns

**Physical abuse**:
- **Injury inconsistent with history**: "Fell off sofa" but has multiple bruises at different stages
- **Injury inconsistent with developmental stage**: Bruising in non-mobile infant ("babies who don't cruise rarely bruise")
- **Delay in seeking medical attention**: Fracture several days old
- **Patterned injuries**: Hand prints, belt marks, burns with clear edges (immersion burns)
- **Unusual sites**: Bruising on ears, neck, genitalia, inner thighs (accidental bruises are usually over bony prominences - forehead, shins, knees)

**Neglect**:
- Severe failure to thrive (inadequate nutrition)
- Severe developmental delay with lack of stimulation
- Untreated medical conditions (missed appointments, non-adherence to treatment for serious condition)
- Poor hygiene, inappropriate clothing for weather
- Child left unsupervised

**Sexual abuse**:
- Child disclosure ("Uncle touches me in private areas")
- Sexualized behavior inappropriate for age
- Genital/anal injuries
- STI in prepubertal child

**Emotional abuse**:
- Severe attachment difficulties
- Extreme fear of parent
- Self-harm

---

#### How to Approach the Conversation

**Step 1: Gather information non-judgmentally**
- **To parent**: "Can you tell me exactly how this injury happened?"
- **To child** (if verbal, age-appropriate, in private if safe): "How did you get this bruise?"
- **Document verbatim**: Use direct quotes

**Step 2: Examine child thoroughly**
- Look for other injuries (undress child fully with consent)
- Photograph injuries (with consent, or via hospital safeguarding team)
- Measure, describe location, size, color (purple = recent, yellow = older)

**Step 3: If concern identified, discuss with senior colleague FIRST**
- Don't confront parent alone
- Discuss with consultant, safeguarding lead, or senior registrar
- Seek advice on whether to notify

**Step 4: If decision is to notify (safeguarding threshold met)**

**To parent** (if safe - sometimes notification made without telling parent if child at immediate risk):
- **Non-accusatory tone**: "As a doctor, I have a responsibility to ensure children are safe. Based on [specific finding: bruises in unusual location, injury that doesn't match explanation], I'm concerned about [child's] safety."
- **Legal obligation**: "I'm required by law to notify the Child Protection Helpline so they can assess the situation and ensure [child] is safe."
- **Not an accusation**: "This doesn't mean I'm accusing you of anything. The Child Protection team will assess the situation and provide support if needed."
- **Remain professional**: Even if parent becomes angry, stay calm

**Step 5: Notify**
- **NSW**: Child Protection Helpline 132 111 (mandatory reporting for doctors in NSW)
- **Victoria**: DHHS Child Protection (different thresholds by state)
- **Provide**: Child details, parent details, your concerns (specific), immediate safety risk?

**Step 6: Document thoroughly**
- Verbatim statements (child and parent)
- Examination findings (diagram, photos if available)
- Who you discussed with (senior colleague, child protection)
- Time and date of notification
- Reference number from Child Protection

---

**What NOT to Do**:
- ❌ Accuse parent ("I think you hit your child")
- ❌ Investigate yourself (this is Child Protection's role)
- ❌ Promise child you won't tell anyone (you must notify)
- ❌ Delay notification because you're "not sure" (if concern present, notify - they will assess)
- ❌ Document opinions ("I think parent is lying") - stick to facts

---

### 5. Breaking Bad News (Serious Diagnosis, Life-Limiting Condition)

**Examples**:
- New diagnosis of cancer
- Diagnosis of severe disability (e.g., severe cerebral palsy, severe intellectual disability)
- Life-limiting genetic condition
- Unexpected death of child (SIDS, trauma)

**Use SPIKES protocol** (adapted for paediatrics):

#### S - SETTING
- **Private room**, adequate time (clear diary for 1 hour)
- **Both parents present** if possible (if separated, discuss with both, separately if needed)
- **Tissue box** available, water
- **Sit down** (same level as parents)
- **No interruptions**: Phone on silent, tell staff you're not to be disturbed

#### P - PERCEPTION
- **Assess what parent knows**: "What have you been told so far about [child's] condition?"
- **Assess what parent suspects**: "What are you most worried this might be?"
- Many parents already suspect something serious

#### I - INVITATION
- **Check if ready**: "Is it okay if I talk to you about the test results now?"
- Most will say yes, but occasionally parents may say "Can we wait for my partner?"

#### K - KNOWLEDGE (Deliver news)
- **Warning shot**: "I'm afraid I have some difficult news to share with you."
- **Pause** (allows parent to prepare emotionally)
- **Clear, simple language**: "The biopsy results show that [child] has leukemia, which is a cancer of the blood cells."
- **Avoid euphemisms**: Don't say "growth" when you mean "cancer", don't say "not good" when you mean "fatal"
- **Pause after delivering news** (allow parents to process)

#### E - EMPATHY
- **Allow silence**, crying
- **Offer tissue**, water
- **Empathic statements**:
  - "I'm so sorry to have to tell you this."
  - "I can't imagine how difficult this is to hear."
  - "It's okay to be upset."
- **Physical comfort if appropriate**: Hand on shoulder (if culturally appropriate), offer to call support person

#### S - STRATEGY and SUMMARY
- **Wait for parent to be ready**: "Would you like me to explain what happens next?"
- **Treatment plan** (if applicable): "The good news is that childhood leukemia is very treatable. [Child] will need chemotherapy, which will be coordinated by the oncology team at [children's hospital]. They'll meet with you to explain the treatment plan."
- **Prognosis** (if asked, be honest but give hope if appropriate):
  - ✅ "With treatment, most children with this type of leukemia go into remission. The oncologist will give you more specific information about [child's] prognosis."
  - ❌ "Don't worry, she'll be fine" (false reassurance)
- **Support**:
  - Oncology team, palliative care (if applicable), social work, psychology
  - Support groups (e.g., Childhood Cancer Association, parent support groups)
  - Financial support (Centrelink, charity organizations)
- **Follow-up**: "I'll arrange for you to see the oncology team this week. Is there anything you'd like to ask me now?"
- **Written information**: Give fact sheets, contact numbers
- **Offer to call support person**: "Would you like me to call your family/friend to come be with you?"

#### Common Questions Parents Ask

**"Why did this happen?" / "Is it my fault?"**
- "We don't know why some children get cancer/this condition. It's not your fault, and there's nothing you could have done to prevent it."

**"How long will treatment take?"**
- "Treatment for leukemia typically takes 2-3 years, but the oncology team will explain the specific plan for [child]."

**"Will my child die?"**
- **If curable**: "Many children with this type of leukemia are cured with treatment. The oncology team will give you more specific information about [child's] outlook."
- **If terminal**: "This is a very serious condition. Some children respond well to treatment, but I want to be honest with you - not all children survive this disease. The oncology team will discuss prognosis in more detail."

**"Should we tell [child]?"**
- "Yes, in an age-appropriate way. The oncology team and psychology can help you with this. Children often sense something is wrong, and it's better they hear the truth from you in a gentle way than overhear it or imagine something worse."

### 6. Non-Adherence to Treatment

**Common Scenarios**:
- Parent not giving prescribed antibiotics
- Parent missing hospital appointments
- Parent not following medical advice (e.g., dietary restrictions for diabetes)

**Why Parents Don't Adhere**:
- **Didn't understand**: Instructions unclear
- **Forgot**: Busy life, multiple children
- **Cost**: Can't afford medication
- **Cultural beliefs**: Prefer traditional medicine, mistrust Western medicine
- **Side effects**: Child vomited medication, refuses to take it
- **Mistrust**: Doesn't believe diagnosis/treatment necessary

---

#### How to Address Non-Adherence

**Step 1: Non-judgmental exploration**
- ❌ "Why didn't you give the antibiotics?" (accusatory)
- ✅ "Tell me what happened with the antibiotics. Were there any difficulties?"

**Step 2: Identify barrier**
- **Understanding**: "When I prescribed the antibiotics, what did I explain they were for?"
- **Practical**: "Was there any difficulty getting the prescription filled or giving the medication?"
- **Beliefs**: "What are your thoughts about antibiotics?" / "Are there any cultural or religious beliefs we should consider?"

**Step 3: Address barrier**

**If didn't understand**:
- Re-explain in simple terms
- Provide written instructions
- Demonstrate (e.g., how to use inhaler)

**If practical barrier** (cost, forgot):
- Cheaper alternatives (PBS-listed generic medications)
- Dosing reminders (phone alarms, apps, Webster pack)
- Simplify regimen (once daily instead of three times daily if option available)

**If cultural/belief barrier**:
- **Respect beliefs**: "I respect that you prefer natural remedies."
- **Negotiate**: "Would you be comfortable trying the antibiotics for 3 days, and we can review? If [child] is improving, we know they're working."
- **Safety-net**: "If you prefer not to use antibiotics, I need you to watch for these warning signs [fever worsening, breathing difficulty, drowsiness]. If any of these occur, you must bring [child] back immediately or go to Emergency Department."
- **Document**: "Discussed treatment recommendations. Parent prefers not to use antibiotics at this stage. Provided safety-netting advice. Parent aware of red flags and when to return."

**If safeguarding concern** (life-threatening condition, parent refusing essential treatment):
- Escalate to senior consultant
- May need involvement of hospital ethics committee, social work, child protection
- Example: Parent refusing chemotherapy for curable cancer, refusing blood transfusion for life-threatening anemia

---

## Shared Decision-Making in Paediatrics

**Definition**: Partnership between clinician, parent, and child (if appropriate age) to make healthcare decisions together

**When to Use**:
- Treatment options with similar outcomes (e.g., antibiotics vs watchful waiting for non-severe otitis media)
- Preference-sensitive decisions (e.g., circumcision for non-medical reasons)
- Chronic condition management (e.g., asthma preventer medication)

**How to Apply**:

**Step 1: Present the issue**
- "Sophie has a mild ear infection. There are two ways we can manage this."

**Step 2: Explain options (including risks/benefits)**
- **Option 1**: "We can prescribe antibiotics. This will treat the infection faster (symptom improvement in 1-2 days). However, there are side effects (diarrhea in 10%, rash in 5%), and overuse of antibiotics contributes to antibiotic resistance."
- **Option 2**: "We can do 'watchful waiting' - give Sophie pain relief (paracetamol) and see if the infection resolves on its own over 2-3 days. Most ear infections improve without antibiotics. If she's not improving in 48 hours, we start antibiotics."

**Step 3: Explore parent's values and preferences**
- "What are your thoughts?"
- "What's most important to you - treating the infection quickly, or avoiding antibiotics if possible?"

**Step 4: Make decision together**
- "Based on what you've said, it sounds like you'd prefer to try watchful waiting first. I think that's a reasonable approach. Let's plan to start antibiotics if Sophie's not improving in 48 hours."

**Step 5: Safety-net**
- "Come back or call if Sophie develops high fever, severe pain, or you're concerned. We can always start antibiotics sooner if needed."

## Cultural Sensitivity in Paediatric Consultations

**Australia is multicultural** - you will encounter diverse cultural beliefs, languages, and practices

### Key Principles

**1. Avoid Assumptions**
- Don't assume based on appearance (e.g., assuming someone speaks a certain language, practices certain religion)

**2. Use Interpreters (if language barrier)**
- **Professional interpreters**, NOT family members (especially not children)
- **Phone or video interpreters** available in hospitals (e.g., "Language Loop" service in NSW hospitals)
- How to use interpreters:
  - Speak TO the patient/parent (not to interpreter)
  - Use short sentences, pause for translation
  - Check understanding

**3. Respect Cultural Practices**
- **Modesty**: Some cultures prefer same-gender doctor for examination (offer chaperone, female doctor if available)
- **Eye contact**: In some cultures (e.g., some Asian, Indigenous Australian), direct eye contact is disrespectful
- **Touch**: Some cultures avoid physical touch from non-family members (explain before touching child)
- **Decision-making**: In some cultures, extended family or elders make medical decisions (ask "Who should be involved in decisions about [child's] care?")

**4. Traditional Medicine**
- **Acknowledge**: "I understand you use traditional medicine for [child]. Can you tell me more about what you're using?"
- **Safety**: "My concern is that some traditional medicines can interact with Western medicines or be unsafe for children. Can we work together to make sure [child] is safe?"
- **Negotiate**: "Would you be comfortable trying [Western medicine] alongside [traditional medicine]?"

**5. Indigenous Australian Families**
- **Use of Aboriginal Liaison Officer** (if available in hospital)
- **Acknowledge**: Cultural respect, connection to Country, family structure (extended family, kinship)
- **Communication style**: May be less direct, use silence, storytelling
- **Mistrust of medical system**: Historical trauma (Stolen Generations) - build trust, explain clearly, avoid paternalism

## Handling Conflict and Difficult Parents

**Common Scenarios**:
- Parent is angry, aggressive, or demanding
- Parent disagrees with your assessment
- Parent requests unnecessary treatment (e.g., antibiotics for viral illness)
- Parent complains about wait time, previous doctors, hospital system

---

### De-escalation Strategies

**1. Stay Calm**
- **Lower your voice** (don't match parent's anger)
- **Slow down speech**
- **Open body language** (don't cross arms, maintain non-threatening posture)

**2. Acknowledge Emotion**
- "I can see you're very upset."
- "I understand you've been waiting a long time and that's frustrating."
- "It sounds like you've had a difficult experience."

**3. Empathize**
- "If I were in your situation, I'd be frustrated too."
- "I'm sorry you've had to wait so long."

**4. Listen Actively**
- Let parent vent (within reason - if becoming abusive, set boundaries)
- "Tell me what's happened."
- Don't interrupt, don't defend

**5. Set Boundaries (if necessary)**
- If parent becomes abusive (swearing, personal insults, threats):
  - "I want to help [child], but I need you to speak to me respectfully. If you continue to swear/shout, I'll have to ask you to leave and we'll call security."
- If parent makes unrealistic demands:
  - "I understand you'd like [MRI scan immediately], but based on my assessment, [child] doesn't need an MRI. I'm concerned about [specific symptoms], and the appropriate investigation is [X-ray/ultrasound/blood test]. If the results are concerning, we can discuss further investigations."

**6. Offer What You CAN Do**
- Instead of saying what you WON'T do, focus on what you WILL do
- ❌ "I'm not giving antibiotics for a virus"
- ✅ "I understand you want [child] to feel better quickly. Antibiotics won't help because this is a virus, but here's what I CAN do: prescribe paracetamol for pain, give you advice on hydration, and arrange a review in 48 hours. If [child] develops bacterial infection signs, we'll start antibiotics then."

**7. Involve Senior Colleague (if needed)**
- "I'd like to discuss [child's] case with my senior colleague to make sure we're giving you the best care."
- Sometimes a second opinion from a senior doctor de-escalates situation

**8. Document**
- Document factually (not emotionally)
- ✅ "Parent expressed dissatisfaction with wait time. Explained triage process. Parent requested antibiotics for viral URTI. Explained antibiotics not indicated. Safety-netting advice provided."
- ❌ "Parent was rude and demanding" (subjective, not professional)

## Common IMG Mistakes in Parent Communication

### Mistake 1: Ignoring the Child

**Problem**: Speaking only to parent, not acknowledging child at all

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Child feels excluded, anxious
- Misses opportunity to observe child's development, interaction
- Not child-centered care (Australian expectation)

**Correct Approach**:
- Greet child FIRST by name
- Engage child throughout (age-appropriate)
- Observe child's response to you, parent, environment

---

### Mistake 2: Using Medical Jargon

**Problem**: "Your child has URTI with rhinorrhea and pyrexia"

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Parents don't understand
- Leads to confusion, non-adherence, anxiety

**Correct Approach**:
- Plain language: "Your child has a cold with runny nose and fever"
- Check understanding: "Does that make sense?"

---

### Mistake 3: Dismissing Parental Concerns

**Problem**: "Don't worry, all children develop at different rates" (when parent concerned about developmental delay)

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Parents often right about concerns
- Delays early intervention
- Damages trust

**Correct Approach**:
- Take concerns seriously: "Tell me more about what you've noticed."
- Assess formally (don't just reassure)
- If concern valid, act (refer, investigate)

---

### Mistake 4: Paternalistic Communication

**Problem**: "This is what you need to do" (telling, not discussing)

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Australian healthcare emphasizes shared decision-making, patient autonomy
- Reduces adherence (parents less likely to follow advice they weren't involved in deciding)

**Correct Approach**:
- **Partnership**: "Let's discuss the options together and decide what's best for [child]."
- **Explore preferences**: "What are your thoughts?" "What's important to you?"

---

### Mistake 5: Not Offering Interpreters

**Problem**: Using family member (especially child) as interpreter, or struggling through language barrier without interpreter

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Inaccurate translation (medical terminology)
- Breach of confidentiality (using family member)
- Unethical to use child as interpreter (burdens child, child may not understand medical terms)

**Correct Approach**:
- **Always use professional interpreter** if language barrier
- Hospital phone/video interpreter services available (free)
- Document: "Professional interpreter used (language: [Mandarin], interpreter ID: [number])"

---

### Mistake 6: Not Safety-Netting

**Problem**: "It's just a virus, it'll get better" (no advice on when to return)

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Parent doesn't know red flags
- Child may deteriorate, parent doesn't know when to seek help
- Medicolegal risk (if child deteriorates and parent claims "doctor said it would get better")

**Correct Approach**:
- **Always safety-net**: "This is a viral illness, which should improve in 3-5 days. However, come back or go to Emergency if [child] develops:
  - High fever (>39°C) lasting >3 days
  - Difficulty breathing
  - Rash that doesn't blanch (show glass test)
  - Drowsiness, floppy, not responding normally
  - Not drinking fluids"
- Document: "Safety-netting advice provided re: red flags and when to return"

---

### Mistake 7: Not Documenting Difficult Conversations

**Problem**: Having safeguarding concern conversation or breaking bad news, but not documenting details

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Medicolegal risk
- Continuity of care (other doctors don't know what was discussed)
- If safeguarding case, documentation critical

**Correct Approach**:
- **Document thoroughly**:
  - What you said (verbatim if breaking bad news)
  - Parent's response
  - Questions asked and answered
  - Information provided (written handouts, fact sheets)
  - Follow-up plan
- Use direct quotes where relevant

## OSCE Practice Stations

### Station 1: Discussing Developmental Delay

**Scenario**: You are a GP. You have just assessed 2-year-old Liam and have concerns about his speech development (using single words, not joining two words). Discuss your concerns with his mother. (8 minutes)

**Model Performance**:

**Minutes 0-1: Acknowledge and Start Positive**
- "Thank you for bringing Liam in today. I've had a chance to observe him, and he's clearly a bright, happy little boy who's doing well in many areas."

**Minutes 1-2: Express Concern**
- "I do have some concerns about Liam's speech development that I'd like to discuss with you."
- **Pause** (allow parent to respond)
- "Have you noticed anything about his speech compared to other children his age?"
- [Parent: "Yes, I've been worried. My friend's child is the same age and speaks in sentences."]
- **Validate**: "It's good that you've noticed. Many parents pick up on these things."

**Minutes 2-4: Explain Concern Specifically**
- "At 2 years old, we'd expect Liam to be joining two words together, like 'more juice' or 'mummy gone'. Liam is using single words beautifully, but he hasn't started joining words yet. This suggests his speech is developing more like an 18-month-old."
- **Check understanding**: "Does that make sense?"

**Minutes 4-5: Explore Parent's Perspective**
- "What do you think might be causing the delay?"
- [Parent: "I'm not sure. Could it be because we speak two languages at home?"]
- **Address**: "Bilingualism can sometimes mean children take a bit longer to speak, but they usually still join words by 2 years, just mixing the languages. I don't think that's the only reason."

**Minutes 5-7: Provide Plan**
- "Here's what I'd like to do:"
  1. **Hearing test**: "First, we need to check Liam's hearing. The most common cause of speech delay is hearing difficulty - if children can't hear well, they can't learn to speak. I'll refer Liam for a hearing assessment with an audiologist."
  2. **Speech therapy**: "I'd also like to refer Liam to a speech therapist. They'll assess his speech and language, and provide therapy to help him develop his skills."
  3. **Early intervention**: "The great news is that children who get support early often catch up. The earlier we start, the better Liam's outcomes."

**Minutes 7-8: Reassure and Follow-Up**
- **Reassure**: "Many children with speech delay do very well with therapy. We're catching this early, which is excellent."
- **Empower**: "You're doing the right thing by bringing Liam in. This gives him the best chance to catch up."
- **Follow-up**: "I'll arrange those referrals today. I'd like to see Liam back in 4 weeks to review progress and discuss the hearing test results."
- **Questions**: "What questions do you have?"
- **Resources**: "I'll give you some information about speech development and services available."

### Station 2: Vaccination Hesitancy

**Scenario**: You are a GP seeing 6-month-old Emma for her routine immunizations. Her mother is hesitant about vaccines. Address her concerns. (8 minutes)

**Model Performance**:

**Minutes 0-1: Open Discussion**
- "I see Emma is due for her 6-month vaccinations today. Before we proceed, I'd like to hear if you have any questions or concerns about vaccines."
- [Mother: "Actually, I'm not sure I want to vaccinate Emma. I've heard vaccines can cause autism."]

**Minutes 1-2: Corroborate (Validate)**
- "I'm glad you're asking questions. As a parent, you want to make the best decision for Emma, and it's good that you're thinking carefully about this."
- "The concern about autism is something many parents have. Can you tell me more about what you've heard?"
- **Listen without judgment**

**Minutes 2-3: About Me (Personal Testimony)**
- "As a doctor and a parent myself, I've vaccinated my own children according to the Australian immunization schedule. I wouldn't recommend anything I wouldn't do for my own family."

**Minutes 3-5: Science (Address Autism Concern)**
- "The fear about autism started with a study in 1998 that has since been completely disproven. The researcher who wrote it falsified data and lost his medical license. Since then, dozens of large studies involving millions of children worldwide have found NO link between vaccines and autism."
- "Autism is a developmental condition that starts before birth - we now know it's genetic and neurological. It becomes noticeable around 18-24 months, which is when children have had several vaccines, so people made a connection. But the timing is coincidental, not causal."
- "The Australian NHMRC, WHO, and every major medical organization worldwide confirm that vaccines do not cause autism."

**Minutes 5-6: Benefits vs Risks**
- "I understand it can seem like a lot of vaccines for a small baby. But let me explain why we vaccinate at 6 months:"
- "Whooping cough is particularly dangerous for babies - it can cause them to stop breathing and can be fatal. Vaccinating at 6 months protects Emma when she's most vulnerable."
- "The risks of diseases are far greater than the risks of vaccines:"
  - Measles kills 1 in 5000 children who get it
  - Whooping cough can be fatal in babies
  - Vaccine serious side effects are extremely rare (1 in a million)

**Minutes 6-7: Empower (Answer Questions, Provide Resources)**
- "What other questions do you have?"
- [Address any other concerns]
- "I'd like to give you some reliable resources: the Immunise Australia government website has evidence-based information. Take time to read it, and we can discuss again."

**Minutes 7-8: Negotiate**
- "Would you feel comfortable vaccinating Emma today, or would you like more time to think about it?"
- **If agrees**: Proceed with vaccination, provide VIS (Vaccine Information Statement)
- **If declines**: "I respect your decision. I'll make another appointment in 2 weeks and we can discuss again. In the meantime, please read the information. If Emma is around unvaccinated people or if there's a disease outbreak, contact me immediately."
- **Document**: "Discussed vaccination benefits and risks. Addressed autism concern with evidence. Mother declined vaccination today, will reconsider in 2 weeks. Provided written information."
