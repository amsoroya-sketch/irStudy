## ABDOMINAL EXAMINATION

### 1. PREPARATION (60 seconds)

**Hand Hygiene**: Wash hands or use alcohol gel

**Introduction & Consent**:
- "Good morning, my name is Dr [Name]. I've been asked to examine your abdomen today."
- "This will involve examining your tummy area. I'll need you to lie flat and expose from your chest down to your pelvis. I'll make sure you're covered with a blanket. Is that alright?"
- "Please let me know if you experience any pain or discomfort."

**Offer Chaperone**: "Would you like a chaperone present for this examination?"

**Check for Pain**: "Before I start, do you have any pain in your tummy right now? Can you point to where it hurts?"

### 2. POSITION

- "I'd like you to lie flat on the bed with your head on one pillow."
- "Can you put your arms by your sides and relax?"
- Patient should be **lying flat** (or as flat as comfortable)
- **Exposure**: From nipples to pubis (use blanket to maintain dignity - fold down to expose only area being examined)
- Stand on patient's **right side**

### 3. PERMISSION

- "I'm going to start by looking at your hands and face, then examine your tummy. Is that okay?"
- Ask patient to empty bladder if not done ("Do you need to use the toilet before we start?")

### 4. PERFORM (6 minutes)

#### A. GENERAL INSPECTION

**From End of Bed**:
- **General appearance**: Well, cachectic (malignancy), jaundiced (liver disease)?
- **Nutritional status**: Obese, thin, muscle wasting?
- **Distress**: Comfortable or in pain?

**Say out loud**: "No anaemia, no jaundice, no lymphadenopathy palpable."

#### E. CHEST

**Inspection** (patient still lying down):
- **Spider naevi**: "I'm going to press on this red spot." (Small red spots with radiating vessels, blanch with pressure - chronic liver disease)
  - Normal to have up to 5, >5 = pathological
  - Distribution: Above nipple line (area drained by SVC)
- **Gynaecomastia** (men): Enlarged breast tissue (liver disease, spironolactone)

**Say out loud**: "No spider naevi, no gynaecomastia."

#### F. ABDOMEN - INSPECTION

"I'm going to examine your tummy now. Can you lower your blanket/gown to expose your abdomen?"

**Expose**: Nipples to pubis (keep groin covered until needed)

**Get down to patient's level** (kneel or bend down to see contour)

**Look for 5 Fs** (causes of abdominal distension):
1. **F**at - Obesity (skin creases)
2. **F**luid - Ascites (flanks bulging, umbilicus everted)
3. **F**latus - Bowel obstruction (distended, tympanic)
4. **F**etus - Pregnancy (ask about LMP in women of childbearing age!)
5. **F**ilthy big tumour - Masses (visible lump, asymmetry)

**Look for**:
- **Distension**: Generalized or localized? Symmetrical?
- **Scars**: (Use acronym **AMPLE SCARS**)
  - Midline laparotomy, paramedian, subcostal (cholecystectomy), Pfannenstiel (C-section, gynae surgery)
  - Laparoscopic port sites (small scars - often missed!)
  - Appendicectomy (right iliac fossa - McBurney's point)
  - Hernia repair scars
- **Stomas**: "Can you tell me about your stoma?" (Ileostomy vs colostomy)
  - **Ileostomy**: Right iliac fossa, spouted, liquid output
  - **Colostomy**: Left iliac fossa, flush, formed stool

- **Visible peristalsis**: Wavelike movements (bowel obstruction)
- **Visible pulsations**: Aortic aneurysm (pulsatile mass, midline)
- **Skin changes**: Bruising (Grey Turner's sign - flank ecchymosis in pancreatitis; Cullen's sign - periumbilical bruising)
- **Hernias**: Ask patient to cough - look for bulges (inguinal, femoral, umbilical, incisional)

**Say out loud**: "Abdomen is soft and non-distended, no visible scars, no masses, no hernias visible."

#### G. ABDOMEN - PALPATION

"I'm going to feel your tummy now. Please let me know if I cause you any pain."

**ALWAYS WATCH THE PATIENT'S FACE while palpating** (look for grimacing = guarding)

**Light Palpation**:
- Use **flat of hand**, all 4 fingers
- Palpate **all 9 regions** systematically (or 4 quadrants)
  - Start **away from area of pain**
  - Gentle pressure, feel for tenderness, masses, superficial lumps
- Look for:
  - **Tenderness**: Where? Guarding (involuntary muscle spasm)?
  - **Masses**: If found, describe site, size, shape, consistency, mobile/fixed, pulsatile, tender

**Say out loud**: "Abdomen is soft and non-tender on light palpation."

**Deep Palpation**:
- Use **deeper pressure** (but not too firm - use judgement)
- Palpate same 9 regions
- Feel for:
  - **Masses**: Describe as above
  - **Organomegaly**: Liver, spleen, kidneys, bladder
  - **Tenderness**: Rebound tenderness, percussion tenderness

**Specific Organ Palpation**:

**1. Liver**:
- "I'm going to feel for your liver. Take deep breaths in and out through your mouth."
- Start in **right iliac fossa** (if very enlarged, you'll miss the edge if you start too high)
- Place hand flat, parallel to right costal margin
- Ask patient to take deep breath in
- Feel for liver edge descending onto your fingers
- Move hand up 2cm at a time towards right costal margin
- **Normal**: Not palpable (or just palpable at costal margin on deep inspiration)
- **If palpable**: Measure in cm below costal margin (in mid-clavicular line)
  - Describe: **edge** (smooth or irregular), **consistency** (soft, firm, hard), **surface** (smooth or nodular), **tender or non-tender**, **pulsatile** (tricuspid regurgitation)

**Say out loud**: "Liver is not palpable below the costal margin."

**2. Spleen**:
- "I'm going to check your spleen now."
- Start in **right iliac fossa** (if massively enlarged, spleen can extend across to right side)
- Place hand flat, parallel to left costal margin
- Ask patient to breathe deeply
- Move hand up towards left costal margin
- **Can't get above it** (unlike kidney)
- **Moves down on inspiration**
- **Has a notch** on medial border
- Confirm: "Can you roll onto your right side?" (Right lateral position makes spleen more prominent)
- **Normal**: Not palpable
- **If palpable**: Measure in cm below left costal margin
  - **Causes**: Infection (EBV, malaria), haematological (leukaemia, lymphoma), portal hypertension (cirrhosis), infiltrative (sarcoid, Gaucher's)

**Say out loud**: "Spleen is not palpable."

**3. Kidneys**:
- "I'm going to check your kidneys with a technique called balloting."
- **Ballot**: Place one hand posteriorly (in flank) and one hand anteriorly
- Push posteriorly with lower hand - kidney (if enlarged) will bounce onto anterior hand
- **Bimanually palpable** (can feel with both hands)
- **Moves down on inspiration**
- **Can get above it** (unlike spleen)
- **Normal**: Not palpable
- **If palpable**: Likely polycystic kidney disease, hydronephrosis, renal cell carcinoma

**Say out loud**: "Kidneys are not ballotable."

**4. Bladder**:
- Palpate in **suprapubic area**
- **Palpable if distended** (urinary retention)
- **Percuss**: Dull if full
- **Normal**: Not palpable unless full

**5. Aorta**:
- "I'm going to feel your aorta."
- Palpate in **midline** above umbilicus
- Use **both hands**, fingers on either side of aorta
- **Normal**: Pulsatile, <3cm wide
- **Aneurysm**: Pulsatile, expansile (pushes fingers apart), >3cm wide
  - **Urgent referral** if >5.5cm or symptomatic

**Specific Signs**:

**Murphy's Sign** (cholecystitis):
- "I'm going to press under your right ribs. Take a deep breath in."
- Place hand below right costal margin (at tip of 9th costal cartilage - where gallbladder is)
- Ask patient to breathe in deeply
- **Positive**: Patient catches breath due to pain (inflamed gallbladder descends onto your hand)

**Rovsing's Sign** (appendicitis):
- Palpate left iliac fossa deeply
- **Positive**: Pain in right iliac fossa (appendicitis)

**Rebound Tenderness** (peritonitis):
- Press gently in area of tenderness, then release quickly
- **Positive**: More pain on release than on pressing (peritoneal inflammation)
- **NOTE**: VERY painful - only do if clinically indicated, NOT routinely in OSCE

#### H. ABDOMEN - PERCUSSION

"I'm going to tap on your tummy now."

**Generalized Percussion**:
- Percuss all 9 regions
- **Tympanic** (drum-like, resonant) - Normal (gas-filled bowel)
- **Dull** - Solid organ (liver, spleen), mass, fluid

**Liver**:
- Percuss from **resonant (chest) to dull (liver)** in mid-clavicular line
- Measure **liver span** (normally 12-15 cm)
- Percussion can detect liver when not palpable

**Spleen**:
- Percuss in left flank
- **Traube's space** (left 6th rib to left costal margin, anterior to mid-axillary line)
- Normally resonant (overlying stomach/bowel)
- Dull if spleen enlarged

**Ascites (Shifting Dullness)**:
- "I'm going to check for fluid in your tummy."
- Percuss from **midline (umbilicus) to flank**
- Mark where resonant changes to dull (fluid level)
- "Can you roll onto your left side?"
- Wait 30 seconds (for fluid to shift)
- Percuss again in same location
- **Positive**: Dull becomes resonant (fluid has shifted away)
- **Fluid Thrill** (if large ascites):
  - Assistant places edge of hand vertically in midline (to stop transmission through fat)
  - Tap one flank, feel for impulse on other flank

**Say out loud**: "Percussion note is tympanic throughout, no ascites detected."

#### I. ABDOMEN - AUSCULTATION

"I'm going to listen to your tummy with my stethoscope."

**Bowel Sounds**:
- Listen in **right iliac fossa** (or any quadrant)
- Listen for **30 seconds**
- **Normal**: Gurgling sounds every 5-10 seconds
- **Absent**: No sounds for >2 minutes (ileus, post-operative)
- **Hyperactive**: High-pitched, frequent, tinkling (bowel obstruction, gastroenteritis)

**Say out loud**: "Bowel sounds are present and normal."

**Abdominal Bruits** (if indicated):
- **Aorta** (midline above umbilicus) - Abdominal aortic aneurysm
- **Renal arteries** (2cm above and lateral to umbilicus) - Renal artery stenosis
- **Liver** (over liver) - Hepatocellular carcinoma (rare)

#### J. HERNIAL ORIFICES (if indicated)

"I need to check for hernias. This involves examining your groin area. Is that okay?"

**Inguinal/Femoral Hernias**:
- **Inspect**: Ask patient to cough, look for bulges
- **Palpate**: Feel for impulse on coughing
- **Inguinal hernia**: Above and medial to pubic tubercle (can get above it)
  - **Direct**: Through Hesselbach's triangle, doesn't descend into scrotum
  - **Indirect**: Through deep inguinal ring, can descend into scrotum
- **Femoral hernia**: Below and lateral to pubic tubercle (can't get above it), more common in women

**Umbilical Hernia**: Bulge at umbilicus, ask patient to cough

**Incisional Hernia**: Bulge through previous surgical scar

#### K. GENITALIA & PR (if indicated - usually NOT in OSCE)

**Male Genitalia**:
- "To complete my examination, I would examine the external genitalia and perform a digital rectal examination."
- **In real practice**: Check for testicular masses, scrotal swelling, hernias descending into scrotum

**Digital Rectal Examination (DRE)**:
- "I would perform a digital rectal examination to assess the prostate (in men), check for masses, and examine stool."
- **Never actually performed in OSCE** - just mention you would do it

#### L. COMPLETE THE EXAMINATION

"To complete my examination, I would like to:
- Examine external genitalia
- Perform digital rectal examination
- Check urine dipstick
- Review observations (blood pressure, temperature)
- Look at imaging (ultrasound, CT abdomen)"

### 5. PRESENT (60-90 seconds)

"Thank you, I've finished examining your abdomen. You can cover up now."

**To Examiner**:

"On examination of the abdomen:
- **General**: The patient appeared comfortable, no jaundice or anaemia
- **Hands**: No clubbing, no palmar erythema, no asterixis
- **Abdomen**:
  - **Inspection**: Soft, non-distended, no scars, no masses visible
  - **Palpation**: Soft, non-tender, no masses, no organomegaly, no hernias
  - **Percussion**: Tympanic throughout, no ascites
  - **Auscultation**: Bowel sounds present and normal

**Summary**: This is a normal abdominal examination."

**Example Abnormal Finding** (Chronic Liver Disease):

"On examination:
- **General**: The patient appeared jaundiced
- **Hands**: Palmar erythema, Dupuytren's contracture, asterixis present
- **Chest**: Multiple spider naevi, gynaecomastia
- **Abdomen**: Distended with flanks bulging, liver palpable 4cm below costal margin (firm, irregular edge), spleen palpable 2cm below costal margin, shifting dullness positive
- **Ascites**: Present

**Summary**: These findings are consistent with **chronic liver disease with portal hypertension and ascites**. I would complete my examination with DRE, urine dipstick, and review liver function tests and imaging."

### Common IMG Mistakes ❌

1. ❌ **Not inspecting properly** - Must get down to patient's level to see contour
2. ❌ **Not exposing adequately** - Can't examine through clothing
3. ❌ **Starting palpation in area of pain** - Always start away from painful area
4. ❌ **Not watching patient's face** - Best indicator of tenderness
5. ❌ **Palpating liver/spleen starting too high** - Will miss lower edge if enlarged
6. ❌ **Forgetting to percuss for ascites** - High-yield clinical sign
7. ❌ **Auscultating before palpation** - Correct order is Inspect → Palpate → Percuss → Auscultate (exception to usual IPPAs - palpation can alter bowel sounds)
8. ❌ **Not mentioning DRE/genitalia** - Always say you'd complete with these
9. ❌ **Rough examination** - Be gentle, especially if patient has pain
10. ❌ **Not asking about pregnancy** - In women of childbearing age, ALWAYS consider

## NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION

### Overview

Neurological examination is HUGE. In an 8-minute OSCE station, you'll be asked to examine a **specific system**, not the entire neurological exam. Common stations:

1. **Cranial Nerves** (CN I-XII)
2. **Upper Limb Neurological Exam** (arms)
3. **Lower Limb Neurological Exam** (legs)
4. **Cerebellar Exam**
5. **Gait Exam**
6. **Speech & Higher Functions**

We'll cover the most common: **Cranial Nerves**, **Upper Limb**, and **Lower Limb**.

---

## CRANIAL NERVE EXAMINATION (CN I-XII)

### 1. PREPARATION

**Hand Hygiene**: Wash hands

**Introduction & Consent**:
- "Good morning, I'm Dr [Name]. I've been asked to examine the nerves in your head and face."
- "This will involve testing your smell, vision, eye movements, facial movements, hearing, and swallowing. Is that alright?"

### 2. POSITION

- Patient sitting upright on edge of bed or in chair
- You standing in front
- Good lighting

### 3. PERMISSION

- "I'm going to test each nerve systematically. Please let me know if you have any questions."

### 4. PERFORM (6-7 minutes)

**Equipment needed**: Snellen chart, pen torch, cotton wool, tuning fork (512 Hz), tongue depressor

**Examine in order I-XII**:

#### CN I - OLFACTORY (Smell)

"I'm going to test your sense of smell."

- Use aromatic substance (coffee, peppermint, vanilla) - NOT ammonia or menthol (trigeminal nerve)
- "Close your eyes. I'm going to hold something under your nose. Tell me when you can smell it." (Don't ask what it is)
- Test each nostril separately (occlude other)
- **Abnormal**: Anosmia (loss of smell) - head trauma, URI, Parkinson's

**Often skipped in OSCE due to time** - say "I would test CN I with smell testing."

#### CN II - OPTIC (Vision)

**A. Visual Acuity**:
- "I'm going to test your vision."
- Use **Snellen chart** at 6 meters
- Test each eye separately (cover other eye)
- "Read the smallest line you can see."
- **Normal**: 6/6 (if wearing glasses, test with glasses on)
- If no chart: "Count my fingers." Or use near vision chart

**Say out loud**: "Visual acuity is 6/6 in both eyes."

**B. Visual Fields (Confrontation Test)**:
- "I'm going to test your peripheral vision. Cover your left eye with your left hand."
- You cover your opposite eye (your right eye)
- "Look straight at my nose. Don't look at my finger."
- **Finger wiggle test**: Bring wiggling finger from periphery in all 4 quadrants
  - Test: Superior temporal, superior nasal, inferior temporal, inferior nasal
  - "Tell me when you see my finger moving."
- Repeat for other eye
- **Abnormal**: Hemianopia, quadrantanopia

**Say out loud**: "Visual fields are full to confrontation bilaterally."

**C. Fundoscopy** (if instructed):
- "I would like to examine the back of your eyes with an ophthalmoscope."
- Usually NOT done in OSCE unless specifically asked
- Look for: **Papilloedema** (raised ICP), **optic atrophy** (pale disc), **diabetic/hypertensive retinopathy**

#### CN III, IV, VI - OCULOMOTOR, TROCHLEAR, ABDUCENS (Eye Movements)

**A. Inspect Eyes**:
- Look for **ptosis** (drooping eyelid) - CN III palsy, Horner's syndrome, myasthenia gravis
- Look for **strabismus** (squint)

**B. Pupillary Reflexes**:
- "I'm going to shine a light in your eyes."
- **Direct reflex**: Shine torch in right eye - right pupil constricts (CN II afferent, CN III efferent)
- **Consensual reflex**: Shine torch in right eye - left pupil constricts
- Repeat on left eye
- **Swinging light test** (for RAPD - relative afferent pupillary defect):
  - Swing torch from eye to eye
  - Both should constrict equally
  - **Abnormal**: Affected pupil dilates when light swung to it (optic nerve lesion)

**Say out loud**: "Pupils are equal and reactive to light. No relative afferent pupillary defect."

**C. Accommodation**:
- "Look at the distance, now look at my finger." (Hold finger 30cm from their nose)
- Pupils should **constrict** and eyes **converge** when looking at near object

**Say out loud**: "Accommodation is intact."

**D. Eye Movements**:
- "Keep your head still and follow my finger with your eyes only."
- Move finger in **H-shape** (tests all directions):
  - Right, Left (CN VI - abducens)
  - Up-right, Up-left (CN III - oculomotor)
  - Down-right, Down-left (CN IV - trochlear)
- Look for:
  - **Full range of movement**
  - **Nystagmus** (rhythmic oscillation - worse at extremes of gaze)
  - **Diplopia** (double vision) - "Do you see two fingers at any point?"

**Say out loud**: "Eye movements are full in all directions, no nystagmus, no diplopia."

**CN III Palsy**: Ptosis, eye "down and out", dilated pupil
**CN IV Palsy**: Diplopia on looking down and in (trouble going down stairs)
**CN VI Palsy**: Cannot abduct eye (eye turned in)

#### CN V - TRIGEMINAL (Facial Sensation & Muscles of Mastication)

**A. Sensory (3 branches)**:
- "I'm going to test the sensation on your face."
- Use **cotton wool** (light touch)
- Test **3 divisions** bilaterally (compare left vs right):
  1. **V1** - Ophthalmic (forehead)
  2. **V2** - Maxillary (cheek)
  3. **V3** - Mandibular (chin)
- "Close your eyes. Tell me when you feel me touch your face."
- Touch each area: "Is this the same on both sides?"

**Say out loud**: "Facial sensation intact in all three divisions of the trigeminal nerve bilaterally."

**B. Motor (Muscles of Mastication)**:
- "Clench your teeth together." (Palpate masseter and temporalis muscles - should feel firm)
- "Open your mouth and don't let me close it." (Resist closure)
- **Abnormal**: Jaw deviates to weak side

**C. Corneal Reflex** (usually skipped in OSCE):
- Touch cornea with wisp of cotton wool - should blink (afferent CN V, efferent CN VII)

**D. Jaw Jerk** (usually skipped):

- **Inspect**: Asymmetry? Nasolabial fold flattened?
- Test muscles:
  1. "Raise your eyebrows as high as you can." (Frontalis - forehead wrinkles)
  2. "Close your eyes tightly and don't let me open them." (Orbicularis oculi)
  3. "Puff out your cheeks." (Buccinator)
  4. "Show me your teeth." (Smile - orbicularis oris)

**Say out loud**: "Facial movements are symmetrical and strong bilaterally."

**Abnormal Findings**:
- **Upper Motor Neuron Lesion** (stroke): Forehead spared (can raise eyebrows), lower face weak
- **Lower Motor Neuron Lesion** (Bell's palsy): Entire half of face weak (cannot raise eyebrows, close eye, smile)

**B. Taste** (usually skipped in OSCE):
- Anterior 2/3 tongue (CN VII), posterior 1/3 (CN IX)

#### CN VIII - VESTIBULOCOCHLEAR (Hearing & Balance)

**A. Hearing**:
- "I'm going to test your hearing."
- **Whisper test**: Stand behind patient (so they can't lip-read), whisper numbers
  - "Repeat the numbers I say." (Cover one ear, whisper in other)
- **Finger rub**: Rub fingers next to each ear - "Which side is louder?"
- **Abnormal**: Deafness (unilateral or bilateral)

**B. Rinne & Weber Tests** (if tuning fork available):
- **Weber**: Place vibrating tuning fork (512 Hz) on forehead
  - "Where do you hear the sound? Middle, left, or right?"
  - **Normal**: Midline
  - **Abnormal**: Lateralizes to deaf ear (conductive loss) or to good ear (sensorineural loss)
- **Rinne**: Place tuning fork on mastoid process (bone conduction), then next to ear (air conduction)
  - "Which is louder - when it's on the bone or when it's next to your ear?"
  - **Normal**: Air conduction louder than bone conduction (Rinne positive)
  - **Conductive loss**: Bone conduction louder than air (Rinne negative)
  - **Sensorineural loss**: Both reduced but AC still > BC (Rinne positive but both quiet)

**Say out loud**: "Hearing is grossly intact bilaterally, Weber does not lateralize, Rinne positive bilaterally."

**C. Balance/Vestibular** (usually not tested in CN exam):
- Test separately in cerebellar exam

#### CN IX & X - GLOSSOPHARYNGEAL & VAGUS (Swallow, Gag, Palate, Voice)

Tested together as function overlaps.

**A. Voice**:
- "Say 'Ahhh' for me." (Listen to voice quality)
- **Hoarse**: Vocal cord palsy (recurrent laryngeal nerve - branch of vagus)

**B. Palate**:
- "Open your mouth and say 'Ahhh'."
- Look at **uvula** and **soft palate**
- **Normal**: Uvula central, palate rises symmetrically
- **Abnormal**: Uvula deviates **away** from weak side (palate pulls to strong side)

**Say out loud**: "Palate rises symmetrically, uvula central."

**C. Gag Reflex** (usually skipped in OSCE):
- Touch posterior pharynx with tongue depressor - should gag
- Afferent CN IX, efferent CN X

**D. Swallow** (ask about symptoms):
- "Do you have any trouble swallowing?"

#### CN XI - ACCESSORY (Sternocleidomastoid & Trapezius)

**A. Sternocleidomastoid**:
- "Turn your head to the right and don't let me push it back." (Place hand on right cheek, patient resists)
- Palpate **left** SCM (SCM turns head to opposite side)
- Repeat on other side

**B. Trapezius**:
- "Shrug your shoulders up and don't let me push them down." (Push down on shoulders, patient resists)

**Say out loud**: "CN XI: Sternocleidomastoid and trapezius power normal bilaterally."

#### CN XII - HYPOGLOSSAL (Tongue)

**A. Inspection**:
- "Open your mouth and stick out your tongue."
- Look for:
  - **Wasting/fasciculations** (LMN lesion)
  - **Deviation**: Tongue deviates **toward** weak side

**B. Movement**:
- "Move your tongue from side to side."
- "Push your tongue into your cheek." (Feel strength with finger on outside of cheek)

**Say out loud**: "Tongue protrudes in midline, no wasting or fasciculations, power normal."

### 5. PRESENT

"On examination of the cranial nerves:
- CN I: Not formally tested (or intact if tested)
- CN II: Visual acuity 6/6, visual fields full, no RAPD
- CN III, IV, VI: Pupils equal and reactive, eye movements full, no nystagmus
- CN V: Facial sensation intact, jaw power normal
- CN VII: Facial movements symmetrical
- CN VIII: Hearing grossly intact, Weber midline, Rinne positive
- CN IX, X: Palate rises symmetrically, voice normal
- CN XI: SCM and trapezius power normal
- CN XII: Tongue protrudes midline, no wasting

**Summary**: Cranial nerve examination is normal."

### Common IMG Mistakes ❌

1. ❌ **Not testing in systematic order** - Always go I-XII
2. ❌ **Forgetting to test accommodation** - Often missed
3. ❌ **Not comparing left vs right** - Symmetry is key
4. ❌ **Missing UMN vs LMN facial palsy** - Check forehead!
5. ❌ **Not doing Weber/Rinne if tuning fork available**
6. ❌ **Confusing tongue deviation** - Deviates TO weak side
7. ❌ **Confusing uvula deviation** - Deviates AWAY from weak side
8. ❌ **Poor technique for CN XI** - Must resist actively
