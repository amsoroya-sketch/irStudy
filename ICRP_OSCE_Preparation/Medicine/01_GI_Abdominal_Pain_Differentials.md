## Dr. Amir Soufi's Approach Applied to Abdominal Pain

### Core Principle: DIFFERENTIAL from LOCATION + CHARACTER

**Traditional Approach (Less Effective)**:
- Take complete generic abdominal history
- Consider diagnosis at end
- All abdominal pain treated identically

**Dr. Soufi's Differential-Driven Approach**:

1. **LOCATION FIRST**: Differential diagnosis generated IMMEDIATELY from pain location
   - RUQ pain → Biliary, hepatic, pneumonia
   - Epigastric → Peptic ulcer, pancreatitis, cardiac
   - RLQ → Appendicitis, gynae (women), renal
   - Etc.

2. **CHARACTER REFINES**: Nature of pain narrows differential
   - Colicky → Obstruction (bowel, renal, biliary)
   - Constant severe → Inflammation, perforation, ischemia
   - Burning → Peptic, reflux

3. **ASSOCIATED FEATURES REFINE FURTHER**:
   - Fever → Infection, inflammation (appendicitis, cholecystitis, diverticulitis)
   - Jaundice → Biliary obstruction, hepatitis
   - Vomiting → Obstruction, inflammation
   - Diarrhea/PR bleeding → Colitis, gastroenteritis

4. **RED FLAGS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED**:
   - **AAA** (ruptured/rupturing abdominal aortic aneurysm) → Abdominal/back pain, age >60, vascular risk factors, hypotension → **IMMEDIATE vascular surgery**
   - **Perforated viscus** → Sudden severe abdominal pain, peritonism, air under diaphragm → **IMMEDIATE surgery**
   - **Ectopic pregnancy** → Abdominal pain + amenorrhea + PV bleeding in woman of childbearing age → **IMMEDIATE gynae**
   - **Mesenteric ischemia** → Severe pain out of proportion to examination, elderly, AF/vascular disease → **IMMEDIATE surgery**

5. **RULE OUT LIFE-THREATENING FIRST**:
   - Always consider: AAA, perforation, ectopic, mesenteric ischemia, bowel obstruction
   - Even if diagnosis seems obvious (e.g., "looks like gastroenteritis"), exclude red flags

6. **TARGETED INVESTIGATIONS**:
   - Let differential guide investigations
   - Example: RUQ pain + fever → LFTs, lipase, ultrasound (biliary)
   - Example: Elderly + AF + severe abdominal pain → Lactate, CT abdomen (mesenteric ischemia)

**Example**:
- **Presenting complaint**: 65-year-old man, sudden severe central abdominal pain radiating to back
- **Immediate differential** (from pattern): AAA rupture, pancreatitis, perforated peptic ulcer, mesenteric ischemia
- **Key question IMMEDIATELY**: "Any history of AAA?" "Vascular disease?" "Blood pressure stable?" (Rule out AAA - life-threatening)
- **Targeted examination**: Pulsatile abdominal mass? Peritonism? Hemodynamically stable?
- **Targeted investigations**: URGENT CT angiogram if AAA suspected, lipase if pancreatitis suspected

## 1. SYSTEMATIC HISTORY-TAKING FOR ABDOMINAL PAIN

### SOCRATES Framework (Pain Characterization)

**S - Site**: Where is the pain? (Point with one finger - maximum tenderness)

**O - Onset**: Sudden or gradual?
- **Sudden** (seconds to minutes) → Perforation, AAA rupture, ectopic rupture, renal colic
- **Rapid** (minutes to hours) → Appendicitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, bowel obstruction
- **Gradual** (hours to days) → Gastroenteritis, constipation, IBS

**C - Character**: What does it feel like?
- **Colicky** (comes and goes in waves) → Obstruction (bowel, renal, biliary)
- **Constant, severe** → Inflammation (appendicitis, diverticulitis), perforation, ischemia
- **Burning** → Peptic ulcer, reflux
- **Cramping** → Gastroenteritis, IBS

**R - Radiation**: Does it spread anywhere?
- **To back** → Pancreatitis, AAA, renal
- **To shoulder** → Diaphragmatic irritation (perforated ulcer, ruptured spleen, cholecystitis)
- **To groin** → Renal colic, AAA

**A - Associated symptoms**: (See detailed section below)

**T - Timing/Temporal pattern**:
- **Constant** → Inflammation, ischemia, obstruction (late)
- **Intermittent** → Biliary colic, renal colic, IBS
- **Worse after eating** → Peptic ulcer (if soon after), biliary (if fatty meal), mesenteric angina (if 30 min after)
- **Worse before bowel motion, better after** → IBS, constipation
- **Wakes from sleep** → Peptic ulcer (alarm symptom), pancreatitis

**E - Exacerbating/Relieving factors**:
- **Movement worsens** → Peritonitis (lie still)
- **Worse with coughing** → Peritonitis
- **Food worsens** → Peptic ulcer (if duodenal ulcer: food may relieve, pain returns 2-3 hours later)
- **Antacids relieve** → Peptic ulcer, reflux
- **Lying flat worsens** → Reflux, pancreatitis
- **Leaning forward relieves** → Pancreatitis

**S - Severity** (0-10 scale):
- **Severe (8-10/10), sudden** → AAA, perforation, ectopic rupture, mesenteric ischemia
- **Severe pain out of proportion to examination** → Mesenteric ischemia (CRITICAL red flag)

---

### Associated Symptoms (Critical for Differential)

**Gastrointestinal**:
- **Nausea/vomiting**:
  - Early vomiting → Gastroenteritis, gastritis, peptic ulcer
  - Late vomiting (after pain) → Appendicitis, obstruction
  - Bilious vomiting → Bowel obstruction (distal to ampulla of Vater)
  - Feculent vomiting → Distal bowel obstruction, bowel ischemia (late)
- **Diarrhea**:
  - Watery → Gastroenteritis
  - Bloody → IBD (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's), ischemic colitis, infectious colitis (Campylobacter, Shigella)
- **Constipation**:
  - Absolute constipation (no flatus or feces) → Complete bowel obstruction
- **PR bleeding**:
  - Fresh red blood → Lower GI (diverticulitis, IBD, ischemic colitis, cancer)
  - Melaena (black, tarry) → Upper GI bleeding
- **Change in bowel habit**: IBD, colorectal cancer (alarm symptom if >50 years)

**Systemic**:
- **Fever**: Infection, inflammation (appendicitis, cholecystitis, diverticulitis, pyelonephritis, pneumonia)
- **Weight loss**: Malignancy, IBD, chronic pancreatitis (alarm symptom)

**Other**:
- **Jaundice**: Biliary obstruction (gallstones, pancreatic head cancer), hepatitis
- **Dysuria/frequency**: UTI, pyelonephritis, renal colic
- **Gynaecological** (in women of childbearing age - **ALWAYS ASK**):
  - **Last menstrual period (LMP)**: Ectopic pregnancy if missed period
  - **Vaginal bleeding**: Ectopic, miscarriage, PID
  - **Vaginal discharge**: PID

## 3. INVESTIGATIONS FOR ABDOMINAL PAIN

### Bedside

- **Vital signs**: Temperature (fever?), BP (hypotension = shock), HR (tachycardia), RR
- **Urine pregnancy test** (βhCG) - **MANDATORY in all women of childbearing age**
- **Urine MCS** (dipstick + formal MCS)
- **Blood glucose** (if DKA suspected)
- **ECG** (if age >50, cardiac risk factors, epigastric pain)

---

### Bloods

**First-line**:
- **FBC**: WCC (elevated in infection/inflammation), hemoglobin (anemia if GI bleeding or chronic disease)
- **CRP**: Elevated in inflammation/infection
- **Lipase**: If pancreatitis suspected (>3x upper limit normal = diagnostic)
- **LFTs**: If RUQ pain, jaundice (AST/ALT/ALP/GGT/bilirubin)
- **UEC**: Renal function, electrolytes (vomiting/diarrhea)
- **Lactate**: If mesenteric ischemia suspected (elevated)
- **βhCG** (blood): If ectopic pregnancy suspected, confirm pregnancy

**Second-line** (if indicated):
- **Blood cultures**: If sepsis (cholangitis, perforated viscus, severe infection)
- **Amylase**: Less specific than lipase for pancreatitis
- **Calcium**: Hypercalcemia → pancreatitis
- **Troponin**: If cardiac cause suspected (ACS)
- **Coagulation** (INR, APTT): If bleeding, liver disease
- **Group and hold / crossmatch**: If surgery likely, GI bleeding

---

### Imaging

**Ultrasound**:
- **RUQ pain**: Gallstones, cholecystitis, dilated bile ducts
- **Pelvic ultrasound** (transvaginal): Ectopic pregnancy, ovarian torsion, ovarian cyst, PID
- **Renal tract**: Hydronephrosis (obstruction)
- **AAA screening**: If suspected (but CT angiogram preferred if unstable)

**CT Abdomen/Pelvis with IV Contrast**:
- **GOLD STANDARD** for most acute abdominal pain (if diagnosis uncertain)
- **Indications**: Appendicitis (if uncertain), diverticulitis, bowel obstruction, pancreatitis (severe), abscess, perforation, malignancy
- **CT angiogram**: AAA, mesenteric ischemia

**Erect Chest X-Ray (CXR)**:
- **Perforation**: Air under diaphragm (free gas)
- Pneumonia (lower lobe)

**Abdominal X-Ray (AXR)** (limited use):
- **Bowel obstruction**: Dilated bowel loops, air-fluid levels
- **Perforation**: Free gas
- **Renal calculi**: Radiopaque stones (but CT better)

**MRI**:
- Pregnancy (if CT contraindicated)
- Liver / pancreatic lesions (better characterization)

---

### Endoscopy

**Upper GI Endoscopy (OGD)**:
- **Indications**: Peptic ulcer (if alarm symptoms), upper GI bleeding, dysphagia, persistent vomiting

**Colonoscopy**:
- **Indications**: PR bleeding, change in bowel habit (age >50), IBD diagnosis/monitoring, 6-8 weeks after diverticulitis (rule out cancer)

**ERCP** (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography):
- **Indications**: Ascending cholangitis (URGENT decompression), biliary obstruction (stone removal), pancreatic duct pathology

---

## 4. MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES

### Resuscitation (ABCDE Approach for Acute Abdomen)

**A - Airway**: Maintain airway (if vomiting, obtunded)

**B - Breathing**: Oxygen if hypoxic, monitor RR

**C - Circulation**:
- **Two large-bore IV cannulae** (if unstable, suspected bleeding, sepsis)
- **IV fluids**: Crystalloid (0.9% NaCl or Hartmann's) - rapid bolus if hypotensive (500ml-1L)
- **Bloods**: FBC, UEC, lipase, LFTs, lactate, group and hold, cultures

**D - Disability**: GCS, glucose (DKA? Hypoglycemia?)

**E - Exposure**: Full abdominal examination, look for peritonism, masses, hernias

---

### Analgesia (Pain Relief)

**OLD MYTH**: "Don't give analgesia before surgical review - it will mask signs"
**MODERN PRACTICE**: **Give adequate analgesia** - improves patient comfort, does NOT adversely affect diagnostic accuracy, improves cooperation with examination

**Options**:
- **Paracetamol** 1g IV/PO (mild pain)
- **NSAIDs**: Ketorolac 10-30mg IV (good for renal colic, biliary colic) - **avoid if suspected perforation, renal impairment**
- **Opioids**: Morphine 2.5-5mg IV (titrate), oxycodone 5-10mg PO, fentanyl 25-50mcg IV
- **Antispasmodics**: Hyoscine butylbromide (Buscopan) 20mg IV (for colicky pain - bowel, biliary, renal)

---

### When to Call Surgery

**IMMEDIATE Surgery Consult**:
- **Peritonitis** (guarding, rigidity, rebound)
- **Perforation** (air under diaphragm, severe peritonitis)
- **AAA** (ruptured/rupturing)
- **Bowel obstruction** (especially if complete, strangulated, closed loop)
- **Appendicitis**
- **Mesenteric ischemia**
- **Acute cholecystitis** (if complicated - perforation, empyema)

**URGENT Surgery Consult**:
- **Diverticulitis** (if complicated - abscess, perforation)
- **Ascending cholangitis** (may need ERCP, but discuss with surgery)

---

## 5. COMMON IMG MISTAKES

1. **Not considering ectopic pregnancy in women of childbearing age**:
   - **ALWAYS do pregnancy test** in women 15-50 years with abdominal pain
   - Ectopic can present with vague abdominal pain, not always classical presentation

2. **Missing AAA in elderly with abdominal pain**:
   - **ALWAYS consider AAA** in patients >60 with abdominal/back pain
   - Palpate for pulsatile abdominal mass
   - URGENT CT angiogram if suspected

3. **Not recognizing mesenteric ischemia**:
   - **"Pain out of proportion to examination"** = CRITICAL red flag
   - Elderly + AF + severe abdominal pain = mesenteric ischemia until proven otherwise
   - Check lactate, URGENT CT angiogram, IMMEDIATE surgery consult

4. **Withholding analgesia before surgical review**:
   - **Give adequate analgesia** - does NOT mask signs, improves patient comfort

5. **Not doing CT for uncertain appendicitis**:
   - If diagnosis uncertain, **CT abdomen** (sensitivity 95%)
   - Reduces negative laparotomy rate

6. **Discharging "gastroenteritis" without considering red flags**:
   - **Always consider** AAA, mesenteric ischemia, early appendicitis, ectopic
   - If elderly, immunosuppressed, severe pain, hemodynamic instability → investigate further

7. **Not checking for peritonism systematically**:
   - **Examine properly**: guarding, rigidity, rebound tenderness, percussion tenderness, lying still
   - Peritonitis = surgical emergency

8. **Missing ascending cholangitis**:
   - **Charcot's triad** (RUQ pain + fever + jaundice) = ascending cholangitis
   - **URGENT** resuscitation, antibiotics, ERCP within 24-48 hours
   - Can progress rapidly to septic shock (Reynolds' pentad)

9. **Inadequate resuscitation in pancreatitis**:
   - **Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation** critical (250-500ml/hr initially)
   - Early enteral feeding (within 48 hours) reduces complications
   - Assess severity (Ranson's, APACHE II)

10. **Not documenting examination findings clearly**:
    - **Document**: Location, peritonism (present/absent), bowel sounds, masses, hernias, rectal exam (if indicated)
    - Medicolegal protection

## OSCE PRACTICE STATION

### OSCE Station: Acute Appendicitis

**Scenario**:
You are the medical officer in the Emergency Department. A 22-year-old woman, Emma, presents with abdominal pain for 24 hours. Take a focused history to establish a differential diagnosis and explain your management plan.

**Task (8 minutes)**:
- Take focused history using differential-driven approach
- Generate differential diagnosis
- Explain investigations and management plan

---

**Model Performance**:

**Opening (30 sec)**:
"Hello Emma, I'm Dr. [Name]. I understand you have abdominal pain. I'd like to ask some questions to understand what's happening. Is that okay?"

**SOCRATES + Associated Symptoms (4 min)**:

**Site**:
"Can you point with one finger to where the pain is worst?"
- Patient: "Here" (points to RLQ)
- "Where did the pain start?"
- Patient: "Around my belly button, then moved here to the right side."
- **✓ Classic appendicitis pattern** (periumbilical → RLQ migration)

**Onset**:
"When did it start? Sudden or gradual?"
- Patient: "Started yesterday morning, gradually got worse."

**Character**:
"What does the pain feel like?"
- Patient: "Constant, sharp, aching."

**Radiation**:
"Does it spread anywhere?"
- Patient: "No, just here."

**Associated symptoms** (CRITICAL):
"Any nausea or vomiting?"
- Patient: "Yes, I vomited twice this morning."
- **✓ Vomiting after pain onset** (appendicitis pattern)

"Any fever or chills?"
- Patient: "I feel hot, but haven't checked my temperature."
- **✓ Fever** (suggests inflammation)

"How's your appetite?"
- Patient: "No appetite at all. Haven't eaten since yesterday."
- **✓ Anorexia** (very common in appendicitis)

"Any diarrhea or constipation?"
- Patient: "No diarrhea. Maybe a bit constipated."

"Any urinary symptoms - burning, frequency?"
- Patient: "No."
- **✓ Rules out UTI**

**Gynecological history** (**CRITICAL in women of childbearing age**):
"When was your last menstrual period?"
- Patient: "Two weeks ago, normal."
- **✓ Rules out ectopic pregnancy** (but will still do pregnancy test)

"Any vaginal bleeding or discharge?"
- Patient: "No."

**Timing**:
"Is the pain constant or does it come and go?"
- Patient: "Constant now, getting worse."

**Exacerbating/Relieving**:
"Does movement make it worse?"
- Patient: "Yes, I try not to move. Coughing hurts."
- **✓ Peritonism** (parietal peritoneum involvement)

**Severity**:
"On a scale of 0-10, how bad is the pain?"
- Patient: "7-8 out of 10."

**Past medical history** (30 sec):
"Any medical conditions? Previous surgery?"
- Patient: "No."

"Any medications?"
- Patient: "Just the pill (contraceptive)."

---

**Differential Diagnosis** (1.5 min to patient):

"Based on what you've told me, I'm concerned you might have **appendicitis** - inflammation of the appendix. The pattern you've described is very typical: pain starting around your belly button and moving to the right lower area, loss of appetite, vomiting, fever, and pain worse with movement.

However, I also need to consider other possibilities:
- **Gynecological causes**: Ovarian cyst, ovarian torsion, ectopic pregnancy (though your period was recent), pelvic inflammatory disease
- **Kidney/urine infection**: Though you don't have urinary symptoms
- **Gastroenteritis**: But the pain pattern and location make this less likely

The most important thing is to investigate properly to determine the cause and ensure we don't miss anything serious."

---

**Investigations** (1 min):

"I'd like to do some tests:

1. **Examination**: I'll examine your abdomen to check for tenderness and other signs
2. **Blood tests**: Check for infection (white blood cells, inflammatory markers)
3. **Urine test**: Check for infection, and **pregnancy test** (important to rule out pregnancy-related causes)
4. **CT scan**: If the diagnosis is uncertain after examination and blood tests, a CT scan of your abdomen will help us see if the appendix is inflamed

Based on the results, we'll know if you need surgery."

---

**Management Plan** (1 min):

"If it is appendicitis, as I suspect, you will need **surgery to remove the appendix** (appendicectomy), usually done through keyhole (laparoscopic) surgery. This is a very common operation.

While we're organizing the tests and surgical review:
- I'll give you **pain relief** (we'll make you comfortable)
- **IV fluids** through a drip
- You'll need to be **nil by mouth** (no food or drink) in case you need surgery
- I'll call the **surgical team** to review you

If the appendix has burst (perforated), you'll also need antibiotics.

Do you have any questions?"

---

**Summary to Examiner**:

"22-year-old woman with **classic presentation of acute appendicitis**:
- **Pattern**: Periumbilical pain migrating to RLQ over 24 hours
- **Associated features**: Anorexia (loss of appetite), vomiting after pain onset, fever, pain worse with movement
- **Examination findings** (would perform): RLQ tenderness at McBurney's point, guarding, rebound tenderness, Rovsing's sign positive, low-grade fever

**Differential diagnosis**:
1. **Acute appendicitis** (most likely)
2. Ovarian pathology (cyst, torsion)
3. Ectopic pregnancy (less likely given LMP 2 weeks ago, but will exclude)
4. PID
5. UTI/pyelonephritis (less likely - no urinary symptoms)

**Investigations**:
- Bedside: Urine βhCG (exclude ectopic), urine MCS
- Bloods: FBC (elevated WCC), CRP (elevated)
- Imaging: CT abdomen if diagnosis uncertain (shows inflamed appendix, appendicolith, periappendiceal fat stranding)

**Management**:
- **Immediate**: Analgesia, IV fluids, NBM
- **URGENT surgical consult** for appendicectomy (laparoscopic)
- If perforated: IV antibiotics (ceftriaxone + metronidazole)
- Admit for surgery

**Expected outcome**: Appendicectomy within hours, laparoscopic, recovery 1-2 weeks, discharge day 1-2 post-op if uncomplicated."

## SUMMARY: KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR ICRP

### Differential-Driven Approach by Location

- **RUQ**: Biliary (colic, cholecystitis, cholangitis), hepatitis, peptic ulcer, pyelonephritis, pneumonia
- **Epigastric**: Peptic ulcer, GORD, pancreatitis, perforation, **AAA**, **ACS**
- **LUQ**: Splenic pathology, gastritis, pancreatitis (tail), pyelonephritis, pneumonia
- **RLQ**: **Appendicitis**, ectopic pregnancy, ovarian torsion, PID, renal colic, Crohn's
- **LLQ**: Diverticulitis, ectopic pregnancy, ulcerative colitis, renal colic
- **Central**: Bowel obstruction, gastroenteritis, **mesenteric ischemia**, **AAA**
- **Suprapubic**: UTI, urinary retention, PID, ectopic pregnancy
- **Diffuse**: Gastroenteritis, peritonitis, DKA, IBS

### The Deadly Six (ALWAYS Consider)

1. **AAA** (age >60, sudden abdominal/back pain, pulsatile mass)
2. **Perforated viscus** (sudden severe pain, peritonism, air under diaphragm)
3. **Ectopic pregnancy** (women 15-50: abdominal pain + amenorrhea + PV bleeding)
4. **Mesenteric ischemia** (**pain out of proportion to examination**, elderly, AF)
5. hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj**Bowel obstruction** (colicky → constant, vomiting, absolute constipation)
