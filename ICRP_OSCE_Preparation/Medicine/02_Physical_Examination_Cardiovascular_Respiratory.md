## CARDIOVASCULAR EXAMINATION

### 1. PREPARATION (60 seconds)

**Hand Hygiene**: "I'm going to wash my hands first." (Use alcohol gel or wash with soap)

**Introduction & Consent**:
- "Good morning, my name is Dr [Name]. I'm one of the doctors here today."
- "I understand Dr [Examiner Name] has asked me to examine your heart and circulation. Is that correct?"
- "This will involve me examining your hands, neck, and chest. I'll need you to remove your shirt, but I'll make sure you're covered with a blanket. Is that okay?"
- "Please let me know if you feel uncomfortable at any point."

**Offer Chaperone**: "Would you like a chaperone present for this examination?"

**Check for Pain**: "Before I start, are you experiencing any pain or discomfort anywhere?"

### 2. POSITION

- "I'm going to position you at 45 degrees, which is the best position to examine your heart."
- Position patient reclined at **45 degrees** with chest exposed (cover with blanket until ready)
- Ensure good lighting
- Stand on patient's **right side**

### 3. PERMISSION

- "I'm going to start by examining your hands and arms, then move up to your neck and chest. Is that alright?"
- Ensure adequate **exposure**: Chest exposed from neck to waist (maintain dignity with blanket)

### 4. PERFORM (6 minutes)

#### A. GENERAL INSPECTION (End of Bed)

Stand back and observe:
- **General appearance**: Comfortable at rest or dyspnoeic? Cyanosed? Pale?
- **Nutritional status**: Cachexic (advanced heart failure) or obese?
- **Equipment**: Oxygen, GTN spray, medications on bedside table
- **Scars**: Median sternotomy (CABG, valve replacement), left thoracotomy (mitral valvotomy)

**Say out loud**: "I'd like to start with a general inspection from the end of the bed. The patient appears comfortable at rest, not short of breath, no obvious cyanosis or pallor."

#### B. HANDS & ARMS

**Inspect Hands**:
- **Clubbing**: Check for loss of angle at nailbed (causes: congenital heart disease, endocarditis)
  - *How to check*: "I'm going to look at your fingers." (Schamroth's window test - ask patient to oppose nails of index fingers)
- **Cyanosis**: Blue discolouration of fingertips (peripheral vs central)
- **Splinter haemorrhages**: Dark lines under nails (endocarditis, trauma)
- **Osler's nodes**: Painful red nodules on finger pulps (endocarditis)
- **Janeway lesions**: Painless palmar macules (endocarditis)
- **Capillary refill**: Press nail bed for 5 seconds, release - should refill in <2 seconds

**Radial Pulse** (Both Wrists):
- "I'm going to check your pulse at both wrists."
- **Palpate both radial pulses simultaneously**: Check for **radio-radial delay** (aortic dissection, coarctation)
- **Count rate** for 15 seconds × 4 (or 30 sec × 2 if irregular)
- **Assess rhythm**: Regular or irregular? (AF = irregularly irregular)
- **Assess character**: Normal, bounding (CO₂ retention, aortic regurgitation), low volume (aortic stenosis)

**Say out loud**: "Pulse is 72 beats per minute, regular rhythm, normal volume, no radio-radial delay."

**Brachial Pulse & Blood Pressure**:
- "I'm going to check your blood pressure now."
- Palpate **brachial pulse** (medial to biceps tendon in antecubital fossa)
- **Assess character**: Slow-rising (aortic stenosis), collapsing (aortic regurgitation)
  - *For collapsing pulse*: "May I lift your arm above your head?" (Feel for collapse at radial pulse)
- **Measure BP**: "I'm going to put this cuff on your arm." (State reading: "Blood pressure is 120/80")

#### C. FACE & NECK

**Face**:
- **Eyes**: Pull down lower eyelid - check for **pallor** (anaemia) or **conjunctival petechiae** (endocarditis)
- **Central cyanosis**: Look at **tongue** (blue = central cyanosis from right-to-left shunt or lung disease)
- **Malar flush**: Red cheeks (mitral stenosis)

**Say out loud**: "I'm going to examine your face and neck now."

**Jugular Venous Pressure (JVP)**:
- Patient at **45 degrees**, head turned slightly **to the left**
- "I'm going to look at the veins in your neck. Can you turn your head slightly to the left and relax?"
- Look for **internal jugular vein** (between two heads of sternocleidomastoid)
- Identify by: Double waveform, moves with respiration, non-palpable, occludes with light pressure at base of neck
- **Measure height**: Vertical distance from sternal angle to top of pulsation (normal <3-4 cm)
- **Assess waveform**: Prominent 'a' wave (tricuspid stenosis, pulmonary hypertension), absent 'a' wave (AF)
- **Check for hepatojugular reflux**: Press on liver for 10 seconds - JVP should not rise >3cm

**Say out loud**: "JVP is not elevated, approximately 2cm above the sternal angle, normal waveform."

**Carotid Pulse**:
- "I'm going to feel the pulse in your neck now."
- Palpate **one carotid at a time** (NEVER both simultaneously - can cause bradycardia/syncope)
- Position: Medial to sternocleidomastoid, at level of thyroid cartilage
- **Character**: Slow-rising (aortic stenosis), bounding (aortic regurgitation)
- **Auscultate for bruits**: "I'm going to listen over your neck arteries." (Carotid stenosis)

#### D. PRECORDIUM (Chest)

**Inspection**:
- "I'm going to examine your chest now. I'll need to expose your chest - I'll use this blanket to keep you covered."
- Look for:
  - **Scars**: Median sternotomy, thoracotomy, pacemaker scar (left infraclavicular)
  - **Visible apex beat**: 5th intercostal space, mid-clavicular line (may see in thin patients)
  - **Visible pulsations**: Abnormal if prominent
  - **Chest deformity**: Pectus excavatum, barrel chest (COPD)

**Palpation**:
- "I'm going to feel your chest now."
- **Apex beat**:
  - "I'm looking for the apex beat." (Use palm of hand first to locate general area)
  - Use **one finger** to precisely locate (normally 5th intercostal space, mid-clavicular line)
  - **Character**: Heaving (aortic stenosis, hypertension), displaced laterally (LV dilatation), thrusting (volume overload)
- **Parasternal heave**: Place **heel of hand** on left sternal edge - lifting suggests RV hypertrophy
- **Thrills**: Palpable murmurs (feel like a cat's purr)
  - Aortic area (2nd intercostal space, right sternal edge)
  - Pulmonary area (2nd intercostal space, left sternal edge)
  - Apex (mitral area)

**Say out loud**: "Apex beat is located in the 5th intercostal space, mid-clavicular line, normal character. No heaves or thrills palpable."

**Auscultation** (MOST IMPORTANT):
- "I'm going to listen to your heart now with my stethoscope. Please breathe normally."
- Warm stethoscope in hands first
- Use **diaphragm** for high-pitched sounds (S1, S2, aortic/mitral regurgitation)
- Use **bell** for low-pitched sounds (mitral stenosis, S3, S4)

**4 Main Areas** (+ 2 extra):
1. **Apex (Mitral)** - 5th ICS, mid-clavicular line
2. **Left sternal edge (Tricuspid)** - 4th ICS, left sternal edge
3. **Pulmonary area** - 2nd ICS, left sternal edge
4. **Aortic area** - 2nd ICS, right sternal edge
5. **Axilla** - Listen for radiation of mitral regurgitation
6. **Carotids** - Listen for radiation of aortic stenosis

**At Each Area, Listen For**:
- **Heart sounds**: S1 (lub), S2 (dub)
  - S1 loud in mitral stenosis, soft in mitral regurgitation
  - S2 split (normal in young people on inspiration)
- **Added sounds**:
  - **S3** (ventricular gallop) - Heart failure, volume overload
  - **S4** (atrial gallop) - LV hypertrophy, hypertension
  - **Opening snap** - Mitral stenosis (heard best at apex with bell)
- **Murmurs**: If heard, describe using 7 S's:
  1. **Site**: Where loudest?
  2. **Systolic or Diastolic**: Time with carotid pulse
  3. **Shape**: Crescendo, decrescendo, plateau, pan-systolic
  4. **Severity**: Grade 1-6/6
  5. **Special manoeuvres**: Inspiration (right-sided murmurs louder), expiration (left-sided), leaning forward (aortic regurgitation), left lateral position (mitral stenosis)
  6. **Spread**: Does it radiate? (AS → carotids, MR → axilla)
  7. **Sound**: Harsh, blowing, rumbling

**Common Murmurs**:
- **Aortic stenosis**: Ejection systolic, harsh, radiates to carotids, slow-rising pulse
- **Aortic regurgitation**: Early diastolic, high-pitched, heard best leaning forward in expiration at left sternal edge
- **Mitral regurgitation**: Pan-systolic, blowing, radiates to axilla
- **Mitral stenosis**: Mid-diastolic, rumbling, low-pitched (use bell), heard best in left lateral position
- **Tricuspid regurgitation**: Pan-systolic at left sternal edge, louder on inspiration

**Dynamic Manoeuvres**:
- "I'm going to ask you to lean forward and breathe out." (Best for aortic regurgitation)
- "I'm going to ask you to roll onto your left side." (Best for mitral stenosis - use bell at apex)
- "Take a deep breath in." (Right-sided murmurs louder on inspiration)

**Say out loud**: "Heart sounds: dual heart sounds, no added sounds, no murmurs audible."

#### E. LUNG BASES

- "I'm going to listen to the back of your chest now. Can you sit forward for me?"
- Auscultate **posterior lung bases** for:
  - **Crackles/crepitations** (pulmonary oedema from heart failure)
  - **Pleural effusion** (reduced breath sounds at base)

**Say out loud**: "Lung bases are clear, no crepitations."

#### F. PERIPHERAL OEDEMA & PULSES

**Ankle Oedema**:
- "I'm going to check your ankles for swelling."
- Press firmly over **medial malleolus** for 5 seconds
- **Pitting oedema** (heart failure, venous insufficiency, hypoalbuminaemia)
- If present, check how far up leg it extends (sacral oedema if bedbound)

**Peripheral Pulses** (if time permits):
- **Femoral pulses**: "I'm going to feel the pulses in your groin."
  - Check for **radio-femoral delay** (coarctation of aorta)
  - Auscultate for **bruits** (peripheral vascular disease)
- **Posterior tibialis & dorsalis pedis**: Check for peripheral vascular disease

**Say out loud**: "No peripheral oedema. Peripheral pulses palpable."

### 5. PRESENT (60-90 seconds)

"Thank you, I've completed the examination. I'll just cover you up and let you get dressed."

**To Examiner**: Present structured findings:

- **Apex beat**: Located 5th intercostal space, mid-clavicular line, normal character
- **Heart sounds**: Dual heart sounds, no added sounds, no murmurs
- **Lung bases**: Clear
- **Peripheral oedema**: Absent

**Summary**: This is a normal cardiovascular examination."

**If Abnormal Finding**:
"I found [abnormality]. This is consistent with [diagnosis]. I would like to complete my examination by:
- Taking a full history
- Reviewing an ECG
- Checking an echocardiogram
- Reviewing medications"

### Common IMG Mistakes ❌

1. ❌ **Not washing hands** - ALWAYS start with hand hygiene
2. ❌ **No introduction/consent** - Essential in Australian OSCE
3. ❌ **Forgetting to position at 45 degrees** - Cannot assess JVP properly otherwise
4. ❌ **Palpating both carotids simultaneously** - DANGEROUS, can cause syncope
5. ❌ **Not timing murmurs with carotid pulse** - Need to know if systolic or diastolic
6. ❌ **Forgetting dynamic manoeuvres** - Left lateral position for MS, leaning forward for AR
7. ❌ **Not checking lung bases** - Important sign of heart failure
8. ❌ **Poor presentation** - Structure: General → Hands → Pulse → BP → JVP → Praecordium → Peripheries
9. ❌ **Not offering chaperone** - Important in Australian clinical practice
10. ❌ **Rough examination** - Always gentle, explain what you're doing

### 4. PERFORM (6 minutes)

#### A. GENERAL INSPECTION

**From End of Bed**:
- **General appearance**: Comfortable or distressed? Using accessory muscles? Pursed-lip breathing?
- **Respiratory rate**: Count for 30 seconds (normal 12-20 breaths/min)
- **Cyanosis**: Blue lips/tongue (central cyanosis = hypoxia)

#### B. HANDS & ARMS

**Inspect Hands**:
- "I'm going to examine your hands."
- **Clubbing**: Loss of nail bed angle (lung cancer, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis)
  - Check with Schamroth's window test
- **Tar staining**: Nicotine stains on fingers (smoking)
- **Cyanosis**: Peripheral (blue fingertips) vs central (blue tongue)

- **Wasting**: Small muscle wasting (Pancoast tumour affecting T1)

**Radial Pulse**:
- Check rate and rhythm
- **Bounding pulse**: CO₂ retention (COPD)

**Say out loud**: "No clubbing, no tar staining, no tremor, pulse 78 regular."

#### C. FACE & NECK

**Face**:
- "I'm going to examine your face and eyes."
- **Eyes**: Pull down lower lid - check for **anaemia** (chronic disease, malignancy)
- **Horner's syndrome**: Ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis (Pancoast tumour)
- **Central cyanosis**: Lift tongue - blue = hypoxia
- **Pursed-lip breathing**: COPD

**Neck**:
- **JVP**: Elevated in cor pulmonale (right heart failure from chronic lung disease)
- **Lymph nodes**: "I'm going to feel the glands in your neck."
  - Palpate **cervical** and **supraclavicular** nodes (lung cancer metastases)
  - Technique: Stand behind patient, use fingertips, systematic approach
- **Trachea**: "I'm going to check if your windpipe is central."
  - Place index finger in **sternal notch**, feel for trachea
  - **Deviation**: Away from tension pneumothorax, towards collapse/fibrosis

**Say out loud**: "No anaemia, no central cyanosis, JVP not elevated, no lymphadenopathy, trachea central."

#### D. ANTERIOR CHEST

**Inspection**:
- "I'm going to examine the front of your chest now."
- **Scars**: Thoracotomy, chest drains
- **Shape**: Barrel chest (COPD - increased AP diameter), pectus excavatum, kyphoscoliosis
- **Movement**: Symmetrical chest expansion? Paradoxical movement (flail chest)?
- **Skin changes**: Radiotherapy marks, bruising

**Palpation**:
- "I'm going to feel your chest now."
- **Chest expansion**:
  - Place hands on lower chest with thumbs meeting in midline
  - "Take a deep breath in."
  - Thumbs should move apart symmetrically >5cm
  - **Reduced expansion**: COPD, pleural effusion, pneumothorax
  - **Asymmetrical expansion**: Pneumothorax, consolidation, collapse, pleural effusion (on affected side)

**Say out loud**: "Chest expansion is symmetrical and adequate."

- **Tactile vocal fremitus** (optional, can skip if time limited):
  - "I'm going to ask you to say 'ninety-nine' while I feel your chest."
  - Place ulnar edge of hand on chest in several positions
  - **Increased**: Consolidation (solid lung transmits vibrations better)
  - **Decreased**: Pleural effusion, pneumothorax, collapse (air/fluid blocks vibrations)

**Percussion**:
- "I'm going to tap on your chest now - it won't hurt."
- Technique:
  - Place middle finger of left hand firmly on chest (perpendicular to ribs)
  - Tap with middle finger of right hand (wrist action, not arm)
  - Percuss **6 areas** on each side (upper, mid, lower zones - compare left vs right)
- **Normal**: Resonant (hollow sound)
- **Hyper-resonant**: Pneumothorax, emphysema
- **Dull**: Consolidation, pleural effusion, collapse
- **Stony dull**: Large pleural effusion

**Say out loud**: "Percussion note is resonant throughout both lung fields."

**Auscultation**:
- "I'm going to listen to your chest now with the stethoscope. Please breathe in and out deeply through your mouth."
- Warm stethoscope first
- Use **diaphragm** of stethoscope
- Listen in **same 6 areas** as percussion (compare left vs right)
- Listen for:
  - **Breath sounds**: Normal vesicular (rustling), reduced (effusion, pneumothorax), bronchial (consolidation - harsh, tubular, louder on expiration)
  - **Added sounds**:
    - **Crackles** (crepitations): Fine = pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary oedema; Coarse = bronchiectasis, pneumonia
    - **Wheeze**: Expiratory = asthma/COPD (airway obstruction); Inspiratory = upper airway obstruction
    - **Pleural rub**: Sounds like creaking leather (pleurisy, PE)
    - **Stridor**: Harsh inspiratory sound (upper airway obstruction - not heard on auscultation, heard at bedside)

**Say out loud**: "Breath sounds are vesicular, equal on both sides, no added sounds."

**Vocal Resonance** (if abnormality detected):
- "Can you say 'ninety-nine' while I listen?"
- Listen with stethoscope in areas of abnormality
- **Increased**: Consolidation (solid lung transmits sound better)
- **Decreased**: Effusion, pneumothorax, collapse

#### E. POSTERIOR CHEST

"I'm going to examine your back now. Can you sit forward and cross your arms in front of you?" (Opens up scapulae)

Repeat same sequence:
1. **Inspection**: Scars, deformity
2. **Palpation**: Chest expansion (place hands on lower back, thumbs on spine)
3. **Percussion**: 6 areas each side (compare left vs right)
4. **Auscultation**: Same 6 areas, listen for breath sounds and added sounds

**Say out loud**: "Posterior chest examination: symmetrical expansion, resonant percussion, vesicular breath sounds, no added sounds."

#### F. COMPLETE THE EXAMINATION

"To complete my examination, I would like to:
- Check oxygen saturations
- Examine sputum (colour, consistency, blood)
- Review peak flow or spirometry results
- Look at a chest X-ray"

### 5. PRESENT (60-90 seconds)

"Thank you, I've finished. You can get dressed now."

**To Examiner**:

"On examination of the respiratory system:
- **General**: The patient was comfortable at rest, respiratory rate 16/min, no accessory muscle use
- **Hands**: No clubbing, no tar staining, no tremor
- **Face**: No anaemia, no central cyanosis
- **Neck**: Trachea central, no lymphadenopathy, JVP not elevated
- **Chest**:
  - **Inspection**: Normal chest shape, symmetrical movement
  - **Palpation**: Chest expansion symmetrical and adequate
  - **Percussion**: Resonant throughout
  - **Auscultation**: Vesicular breath sounds bilaterally, no added sounds

**Summary**: This is a normal respiratory examination."

**If Abnormal Finding Example** (Right Lower Lobe Pneumonia):

"On examination:
- **Inspection**: Patient appears mildly unwell, respiratory rate 22/min
- **Palpation**: Reduced chest expansion on the right lower zone
- **Percussion**: Dull percussion note over right lower zone
- **Auscultation**: Bronchial breath sounds over right lower zone with coarse crackles, increased vocal resonance

**Summary**: These findings are consistent with **right lower lobe consolidation**, likely pneumonia. I would like to complete my examination by checking oxygen saturations, examining sputum, and reviewing a chest X-ray."

### Common Clinical Findings - What They Mean

| Finding | Inspection | Expansion | Percussion | Breath Sounds | Added Sounds | Vocal Resonance |
|---------|-----------|-----------|------------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Normal** | Normal | Symmetrical | Resonant | Vesicular | None | Normal |
| **Pneumonia (consolidation)** | ↓ Movement affected side | ↓ Affected side | Dull | Bronchial | Coarse crackles | ↑ Increased |
| **Pleural effusion** | ↓ Movement affected side | ↓ Affected side | Stony dull | ↓ Reduced/absent | None | ↓ Decreased |
| **Pneumothorax** | ↓ Movement affected side | ↓ Affected side | Hyper-resonant | ↓ Reduced/absent | None | ↓ Decreased |

| **Asthma (acute)** | Use of accessory muscles | ↓ Bilaterally | Normal/hyper-resonant | Normal | Widespread wheeze | Normal |
| **Pulmonary fibrosis** | Normal/reduced | ↓ Bilaterally | Normal | Normal | Fine inspiratory crackles (Velcro-like) | Normal/↑ |
| **Bronchiectasis** | Normal | Normal | Normal | Normal | Coarse crackles, sometimes wheeze | Normal |

### Common IMG Mistakes ❌

1. ❌ **Not counting respiratory rate** - Simple but often forgotten
2. ❌ **Not checking for clubbing properly** - Must use Schamroth's test
3. ❌ **Forgetting to check trachea** - Important for pneumothorax/collapse
4. ❌ **Poor percussion technique** - Need firm finger on chest, wrist flick
5. ❌ **Not comparing left vs right** - Must always compare symmetry
6. ❌ **Forgetting posterior examination** - Most lung pathology is in lower/posterior zones
7. ❌ **Not exposing patient properly** - Can't see chest movement with shirt on
8. ❌ **Asking patient to breathe too fast** - Can cause hyperventilation/dizziness
9. ❌ **Not presenting systematically** - Always: Inspection → Palpation → Percussion → Auscultation
10. ❌ **Forgetting to mention "complete examination"** - Always offer to check sats, sputum, CXR
