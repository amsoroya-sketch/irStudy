            <h3>Scenario</h3>
            <p>You are the RMO on call in the Emergency Department at Young District Hospital. You have been asked to assess a 24-year-old woman, Sarah Mitchell, who has presented with right-sided abdominal pain for the past 12 hours.</p>

            <h3>Your Task (8 minutes)</h3>
            <p><strong>Take a focused history</strong> to identify the likely diagnosis and establish the severity of her condition. You do NOT need to examine the patient.</p>

            <h3>You Should Cover:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Nature and progression of the abdominal pain</li>
                <li>Associated symptoms</li>
                <li>Relevant gynaecological history</li>
                <li>Past medical and surgical history</li>
                <li>Risk assessment and differential diagnoses</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="warning">
                <strong>⏰ Time Warning:</strong> The examiner will give you a 1-minute warning at the 7-minute mark to allow you to summarize your findings.

            <h4>If Asked "What are you worried about?"</h4>
            <p>"I'm worried I might need an operation. I've never had surgery before apart from my wisdom teeth. And I'm supposed to be teaching next week - the kids are doing their Christmas concert rehearsals."</p>

            <h4>If Asked "What were you hoping we could do?"</h4>
            <p>"I just want the pain to go away. If I need surgery, I want to get it sorted. I can't go on like this."</p>

            <h3>Emotional State</h3>
            <p>Patient is in moderate pain, cooperative but uncomfortable. Lies very still on the trolley. Grimaces with any movement. Answers questions but keeps responses brief due to pain.</p>

            <h3>Immediate Next Steps</h3>

            <h4>Clinical Examination:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Abdominal examination: Tenderness at McBurney's point, rebound tenderness, guarding</li>
                <li>Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign</li>
                <li>Vital signs: HR, BP, temperature, RR (assess for sepsis)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Investigations (eTG 2024 recommendations):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>🚨 <strong>Pregnancy test (βhCG)</strong> - MANDATORY in all females of reproductive age with abdominal pain</li>
                <li><strong>Full blood count (FBC):</strong> Elevated WCC with neutrophilia (typically 10-18 × 10⁹/L)</li>
                <li><strong>CRP:</strong> Elevated (typically 20-100 mg/L in uncomplicated appendicitis)</li>
                <li><strong>Electrolytes, urea, creatinine (EUC):</strong> Pre-operative assessment</li>
                <li><strong>Urinalysis:</strong> May show mild pyuria (5-10 WBC/hpf), helps exclude UTI</li>
                <li><strong>CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast</strong> (if diagnosis unclear):
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sensitivity 94%, specificity 95% for appendicitis</li>
                        <li>Dilated appendix (>6mm), appendiceal wall thickening, periappendiceal fat stranding</li>
                        <li>Can identify complications (perforation, abscess)</li>
                        <li>Can identify alternative diagnoses (ovarian pathology)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Ultrasound pelvis</strong> (alternative in females, especially if βhCG positive or CT contraindicated):
                    <ul>
                        <li>Can visualize appendix and ovaries</li>
                        <li>Less sensitive than CT (sensitivity 78-83%)</li>
                        <li>Operator dependent</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Immediate Management (eTG 2024):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Keep nil by mouth (NBM)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>IV access:</strong> Large-bore cannula (16-18G)</li>
                <li><strong>IV fluids:</strong> Sodium chloride 0.9% or Hartmann's solution</li>
                <li><strong>Analgesia:</strong>

                        <li>Consider ketorolac 10-30mg IV (NSAID - if no contraindications)</li>
                        <li>⚠️ Note: Analgesia does NOT mask clinical signs and should be given early</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Anti-emetics:</strong> Ondansetron 4-8mg IV (if vomiting)</li>

                <li><strong>Consent for appendicectomy</strong> (laparoscopic preferred)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Definitive Management:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Laparoscopic appendicectomy</strong> (gold standard):
                    <ul>
                        <li>Shorter hospital stay (1-2 days vs 3-5 days open)</li>
                        <li>Less post-operative pain</li>
                        <li>Faster return to normal activities (1-2 weeks)</li>
                        <li>Lower wound infection rate</li>
                        <li>Better cosmetic result</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Open appendicectomy</strong> (if laparoscopy contraindicated or complicated appendicitis)</li>

            <h3>Complications to Monitor For</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>🚨 <strong>Perforation:</strong> High fever (>38.5°C), severe pain, peritonitis, sepsis (occurs in 20-30% if delay >48 hours)</li>
                <li>🚨 <strong>Abscess formation:</strong> Persistent fever, palpable mass</li>
                <li>🚨 <strong>Peritonitis:</strong> Generalized abdominal pain, guarding, rigidity</li>
                <li>🚨 <strong>Sepsis:</strong> Tachycardia, hypotension, altered conscious state</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Prognosis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Excellent with early surgery (mortality <0.1% for uncomplicated appendicitis)</li>
                <li>Risk of perforation increases 5% per 12 hours after symptom onset</li>
                <li>Laparoscopic appendicectomy: typical recovery 1-2 weeks</li>

            <h3>Australian-Specific Considerations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>eTG 2024 first-line antibiotic:</strong> Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5g IV (NOT ceftriaxone + metronidazole unless penicillin allergy)</li>
                <li><strong>NSW Health pathway:</strong> All suspected appendicitis requires surgical review within 4 hours</li>
                <li><strong>Terminology:</strong> Use "RIF pain" (not "right lower quadrant"), "theatre" (not OR), "NBM" (not NPO)</li>
                <li><strong>Imaging:</strong> CT with IV contrast preferred over ultrasound in adults (eTG 2024)</li>
                <li><strong>Analgesia:</strong> Australian practice encourages early adequate analgesia (does not mask signs)</li>

            <h2>⚠️ IMG Common Mistakes - Critical Errors to Avoid</h2>

            <p><strong>These 10 mistakes are commonly made by international medical graduates and will lead to failure in the AMC OSCE. Learn from these to avoid critical errors.</strong></p>

            <div class="mistake">
                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #1: Not Asking About Last Menstrual Period (LMP) in Female Patient</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> In Australia, asking about LMP is MANDATORY for ALL females of reproductive age (roughly 12-55 years) presenting with abdominal pain. This is a CRITICAL FAILURE if omitted because ectopic pregnancy can be life-threatening and presents with abdominal pain.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> IMG candidates often jump straight to surgical assessment without considering gynaecological causes. Australian examiners expect systematic gynae history in all females with abdominal pain.
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: "When was your last menstrual period?" and "Is there any chance you could be pregnant?" are NON-NEGOTIABLE questions. Ask these early in the history.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #2: Not Asking About Anorexia (Loss of Appetite)</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> Anorexia is present in 95% of appendicitis cases and is one of the most important diagnostic features. Not asking about appetite/food intake is a critical omission.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> IMG candidates often focus on pain and vomiting but forget to ask "Have you been able to eat?" or "How is your appetite?" This is a KEY discriminator between appendicitis and other causes.
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: Ask explicitly "How has your appetite been?" or "Have you felt like eating?" The answer "I haven't felt hungry at all" or "The thought of food makes me sick" is HIGHLY suggestive of appendicitis.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #3: Not Recognizing Peritonism (Pain Worse with Movement)</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> Peritonism (peritoneal inflammation) is a red flag for surgical emergency. If the patient says "pain worse with coughing" or "lying very still," this indicates peritoneal irritation and requires urgent surgical review.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> IMG candidates often don't ask the specific question "What makes the pain worse?" and miss the critical clue that movement/coughing exacerbates the pain.
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: Ask "What makes the pain worse?" and "What makes it better?" Listen for: worse with movement, coughing, car bumps, walking. This patient said "Even when the car went over speed bumps it was agony" - CLASSIC peritonism.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #4: Not Asking About Pain Migration (Periumbilical → RIF)</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> Classical appendicitis presents with pain starting AROUND THE BELLY BUTTON (periumbilical) which then MIGRATES to the right iliac fossa (RIF) over several hours. This migration is pathognomonic for appendicitis.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> IMG candidates ask "Where is the pain?" but don't ask "Where did it start?" or "Has the pain moved?" Missing this migration pattern means missing the diagnosis.
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: Ask "Where exactly did the pain start?" and "Has it moved anywhere?" The answer "It started around my belly button and moved to the right lower side" is GOLD STANDARD for appendicitis.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #5: Using American/British Terminology Instead of Australian</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> Australian medical culture uses specific terminology. Using American terms like "RLQ" (right lower quadrant) instead of "RIF" (right iliac fossa), or "NPO" instead of "NBM" (nil by mouth) marks you as unfamiliar with Australian practice.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> While this alone won't fail you, accumulated terminology errors signal to examiners that you haven't adapted to Australian medical culture.
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT Australian terms: "RIF" not "RLQ", "NBM" not "NPO", "theatre" not "OR", "paracetamol" not "acetaminophen", "ED" not "ER", "bloods" not "labs", "FBC" not "CBC".
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #6: Not Asking About Sequence of Symptoms (Pain Before Vomiting)</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> In appendicitis, PAIN comes BEFORE vomiting (95% of cases). If vomiting comes before pain, this suggests gastroenteritis, not appendicitis. The sequence matters diagnostically.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> IMG candidates ask about vomiting but don't establish the timeline. "When did you start vomiting in relation to the pain?" is crucial.
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: Ask "Did the pain start before or after the vomiting?" In appendicitis: pain first (periumbilical), then anorexia, then nausea, then vomiting (several hours later).
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #7: Not Excluding Ectopic Pregnancy (Even if Patient Says "No Chance")</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> In Australian practice, ectopic pregnancy MUST be formally excluded with βhCG in ALL females of reproductive age with abdominal pain, regardless of contraception use, LMP, or patient's stated pregnancy risk.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> IMG candidates take the patient's word ("I'm on the pill, I can't be pregnant") and don't mention βhCG testing. This is unsafe practice - contraception can fail, and ectopic pregnancy can be life-threatening.
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: Even though this patient is on OCP with normal LMP 2 weeks ago, your summary MUST include "We'll need to do a pregnancy test to be safe" or "βhCG to exclude pregnancy." This is NON-NEGOTIABLE in Australian EM/Surgical practice.
                </div>

                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> ABSENCE of diarrhoea is a key discriminator. Gastroenteritis (common differential) typically presents with diarrhoea + vomiting. Appendicitis does NOT cause diarrhoea. Not asking means you can't differentiate.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> IMG candidates focus on positive findings (pain, vomiting) but forget that NEGATIVE findings (no diarrhoea, no urinary symptoms) are equally important for building a differential.
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: Ask "Have you had any diarrhoea?" The answer "No" helps you exclude gastroenteritis and supports appendicitis diagnosis. Always ask about bowel habits in abdominal pain.

                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #9: Poor Time Management - Running Out of Time Before Completing Gynae History</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> IMG candidates often spend too long on pain history (asking repetitive questions about the same pain) and run out of time before asking about LMP, pregnancy, sexual history. This results in CRITICAL FAILURES.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> You have 8 minutes. If you spend 5 minutes on pain alone, you won't have time for gynae history (which is MANDATORY). Structure is everything.
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: Time allocation for RIF pain in female: Introduction (30 sec) → Pain SOCRATES (2-3 min) → Associated GI symptoms (1 min) → Gynae history INCLUDING LMP/pregnancy (1.5 min) → PMHx/Meds/Allergies (1 min) → ICE + Summary (1.5 min). Practice this structure.

                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #10: Not Demonstrating Empathy for Patient in Acute Pain</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> This patient is in 7-8/10 pain and lying very still. If you launch into rapid-fire questions without acknowledging their discomfort ("I can see you're in a lot of pain, I'll be as quick as I can"), you'll fail the communication domain.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> IMG candidates sometimes focus so hard on "getting the history right" that they forget the patient is suffering. Australian OSCE heavily weights empathy and communication.
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: Start with "I can see you're uncomfortable" or "I know this is painful, I'll try to be as quick as possible" or "Please let me know if you need a break." Show awareness of their distress throughout the consultation.

            <h3>Summary of Critical "Must Do" Items for RIF Pain Station:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>✅ Ask about Last Menstrual Period (LMP) - MANDATORY</li>
                <li>✅ Ask about pregnancy possibility - MANDATORY</li>
                <li>✅ Ask about anorexia (appetite/food intake) - KEY diagnostic feature</li>
                <li>✅ Ask about pain migration (periumbilical → RIF) - PATHOGNOMONIC</li>
                <li>✅ Ask what makes pain worse (looking for peritonism) - RED FLAG</li>
                <li>✅ Ask about diarrhoea (absence helps exclude gastroenteritis)</li>
                <li>✅ Ask about sequence (pain before vomiting?) - DIAGNOSTIC</li>
                <li>✅ Use Australian terminology (RIF not RLQ, NBM not NPO)</li>
                <li>✅ Manage time to complete gynae history (don't run out of time)</li>
                <li>✅ Show empathy throughout (patient is in acute pain)</li>
            </ol>

                <h4>🎯 IMG Success Tips for Surgical History Stations:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Use SOCRATES for ALL pain:</strong> Site, Onset, Character, Radiation, Associated symptoms, Timing, Exacerbating/relieving, Severity. This ensures systematic coverage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Always ask about "red flag" symptoms:</strong> Fever, peritonism, progression, severity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Female + abdominal pain = ALWAYS ask LMP and pregnancy:</strong> This is non-negotiable in Australian practice.</li>
                    <li><strong>Practice saying "When was your last period?" naturally:</strong> Don't be embarrassed - it's routine medical history.</li>
                    <li><strong>Learn Australian differential diagnoses for RIF pain in females:</strong> Appendicitis, ovarian cyst/torsion, ectopic pregnancy, PID, Mittelschmerz, mesenteric adenitis, UTI/pyelonephritis, Crohn's disease.</li>
                    <li><strong>Know eTG 2024 first-line treatment:</strong> Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5g IV for appendicitis (not ceftriaxone unless allergy).</li>
                    <li><strong>Always mention βhCG in your management:</strong> Even if pregnancy seems unlikely, you MUST exclude it formally.</li>
                </ul>
