            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Geriatric Medicine / General Practice - History Taking (Multifactorial Assessment)</p>
            <p><strong>Time:</strong> 8 minutes</p>
            <p><strong>Setting:</strong> GP Clinic, Young Medical Centre, NSW</p>
            <p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Intermediate-Advanced (requires comprehensive assessment)</p>
            <p><strong>AMC Blueprint Area:</strong> Falls Prevention - Multifactorial Risk Assessment</p>
        </div>

        <!-- CANDIDATE INSTRUCTIONS -->
        <div class="section candidate-instructions">
            <h2>📋 Candidate Instructions</h2>

            <h3>Scenario</h3>
            <p>You are a GP registrar working at Young Medical Centre. Your next patient is Mrs. Margaret Robertson, an 82-year-old woman who has presented following a fall at home 2 days ago. She was not injured but is worried about falling again.</p>

            <h3>Your Task (8 minutes)</h3>
            <p><strong>Take a focused history</strong> to identify risk factors for falls and assess the multifactorial causes. You do NOT need to examine the patient.</p>

            <h3>You Should Cover:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Circumstances of the fall (what happened, when, where, how)</li>
                <li>🚨 Red flags for serious causes (syncope, seizure, stroke)</li>
                <li>Intrinsic risk factors (vision, gait/balance, medications, cardiovascular, neurological, cognitive)</li>
                <li>Extrinsic risk factors (environmental hazards, footwear, lighting)</li>
                <li>Previous falls history</li>
                <li>Functional impact and fear of falling</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="warning">
                <strong>⏰ Time Warning:</strong> The examiner will give you a 1-minute warning at the 7-minute mark to allow you to summarize your findings and outline your management plan.
            </div>

            <div class="warning">
                <strong>🚨 CRITICAL:</strong> Falls in elderly people are MULTIFACTORIAL - average 4-5 risk factors per person. You must systematically assess ALL major risk factor categories. Missing medications (polypharmacy) or vision impairment = incomplete assessment.
            </div>

            <div class="tip">
                <strong>💡 Australian Context:</strong> Falls are the leading cause of injury-related hospitalization in Australians aged >65 (NSW Health 2024). 30% of people >65 fall each year, rising to 50% in those >80. Examiners expect systematic multifactorial assessment covering medical, functional, and environmental factors.

                <li><strong>Do you wear glasses?</strong> "Yes, I have reading glasses and distance glasses. But sometimes I forget which ones I'm wearing"</li>
                <li><strong>Can you see clearly when you're walking?</strong> "Not really - everything is a bit fuzzy. I've been meaning to get my eyes checked but I keep putting it off"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Gait & Balance:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Do you have any problems with walking or balance?</strong> "I'm not as steady as I used to be. I use a walking stick now - I've been using it for about a year"</li>
                <li><strong>Do you feel unsteady when you walk?</strong> "Yes, sometimes. Especially on uneven ground or when I turn around"</li>
                <li><strong>Any weakness in your legs?</strong> "My legs feel weak sometimes. I have arthritis in both knees and hips, so it's quite painful to walk"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Cardiovascular - Postural Hypotension:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Do you ever feel dizzy when you stand up?</strong> "Actually yes - especially in the mornings when I get out of bed. I feel quite lightheaded and have to hold onto something for a moment" 🚨 (postural hypotension)</li>
                <li><strong>How long does the dizziness last?</strong> "Just a minute or so, then it passes"</li>
                <li><strong>Have you ever fainted or blacked out?</strong> "No, never actually fainted. Just felt dizzy"</li>
                <li><strong>Any heart problems?</strong> "I have high blood pressure - I take tablets for that"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Neurological:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Any history of stroke?</strong> "No"</li>
                <li><strong>Any tremor or Parkinson's disease?</strong> "No"</li>
                <li><strong>Any numbness or tingling in your feet?</strong> "A little bit of numbness in my toes - the doctor said it might be circulation"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Cognitive Function:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>How is your memory?</strong> "Pretty good for my age. I remember my grandchildren's birthdays and what I did yesterday. Sometimes I forget names but nothing too bad"</li>
                <li><strong>Any confusion or getting lost?</strong> "No, nothing like that"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Urinary Symptoms (Nocturia - Fall Risk):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Do you get up at night to pass urine?</strong> "Yes, usually 2-3 times a night" 🚨 (nocturia - increased fall risk, rushing to toilet in dark)</li>
                <li><strong>Do you rush to the toilet?</strong> "Sometimes, yes. When I need to go, I need to go quite urgently"</li>
                <li><strong>Any incontinence?</strong> "Occasionally I leak a little bit if I don't get there in time"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Medications - CRITICAL ASSESSMENT</h3>
            <p><em>Patient has brought medication list from pharmacy</em></p>

            <ul>

            </ul>

            <p><strong>Current Medications (5 medications = POLYPHARMACY):</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Amlodipine 10mg daily</strong> (for hypertension - can cause postural hypotension)</li>
                <li><strong>Ramipril 10mg daily</strong> (for hypertension - RECENT INCREASE from 5mg to 10mg TWO WEEKS AGO 🚨 - likely causing postural hypotension)</li>
                <li><strong>Atorvastatin 40mg nocte</strong> (for cholesterol)</li>
                <li><strong>Temazepam 10mg nocte</strong> (sedative - FALL RISK 🚨)</li>
                <li><strong>Paracetamol 500mg as needed</strong> (for arthritis pain - up to 8 tablets/day)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>If Asked About When Medications Started/Changed:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ramipril increase:</strong> "The doctor increased my blood pressure tablet about 2 weeks ago because my blood pressure was still a bit high" 🚨 <strong>KEY - temporal association with recent fall</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Temazepam:</strong> "I've been taking the sleeping tablet for about 3 months. I was having trouble sleeping"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>If Asked About Side Effects:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dizziness on standing:</strong> "Yes, as I mentioned - especially in the mornings. It's got worse in the past couple of weeks" (since ramipril increase)</li>
                <li><strong>Drowsiness from temazepam:</strong> "The sleeping tablet works well - maybe too well. I sometimes feel a bit groggy in the morning and I get up once or twice in the night still feeling a bit drowsy"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Extrinsic Risk Factors - Home Environment</h3>

            <h4>Home Hazards:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Do you live in a house or unit?</strong> "A house - I've lived there for 40 years"</li>
                <li><strong>Any stairs?</strong> "No, it's all single level, thank goodness"</li>
                <li><strong>Do you have any loose rugs or mats?</strong> "Yes, I have rugs in the hallway and lounge room. That's what I tripped on" 🚨</li>
                <li><strong>How is the lighting in your home?</strong> "Not great - the hallway is quite dark, especially at night. I've been meaning to put a brighter bulb in" 🚨</li>
                <li><strong>Do you have rails in the bathroom?</strong> "No, I don't have any rails. I've been thinking about getting some installed"</li>
                <li><strong>Do you have a night light?</strong> "No - maybe I should get one for the hallway for when I get up at night"</li>
                <li><strong>What shoes do you usually wear at home?</strong> "Slippers - they're quite old and a bit loose" 🚨 (poor footwear)</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Does anyone check on you regularly?</strong> "My daughter visits twice a week and calls every day"</li>
                <li><strong>Do you have a personal alarm or medical alert?</strong> "No, I don't have one. My daughter has been suggesting I get one but I keep saying I don't need it"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Functional Impact & Fear of Falling</h3>

            <h4>Activities of Daily Living (ADLs):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Can you manage your own shopping, cooking, cleaning?</strong> "I can cook, but my daughter does the shopping for me now. Cleaning is hard - I can't bend down very well"</li>
                <li><strong>Can you manage showering and dressing yourself?</strong> "Yes, but it takes me a long time. I have to be very careful in the shower"</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Are you worried about falling again?</strong> "Yes, very worried. That's why I'm here. I keep thinking about what would have happened if I'd hit my head or broken my hip" 🚨</li>
                <li><strong>Has this affected what you do?</strong> "Definitely. I've stopped going to my walking group because I'm scared I might fall outside. I don't go out as much as I used to" 🚨 (fear of falling → reduced activity → deconditioning → increased fall risk = vicious cycle)</li>
                <li><strong>Do you feel confident walking around?</strong> "Not really - I'm always on edge, worried I might trip over something"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Patient Concerns (ICE)</h3>

            <h4>If Asked "What are you most worried about?"</h4>
            <p>"I'm worried I'll fall and break my hip like my friend did. She fell and broke her hip and never really recovered - she ended up in a nursing home. I don't want to end up like that. I want to stay in my own home."</p>

            <h4>If Asked "What were you hoping we could do?"</h4>
            <p>"I want to know why I keep falling and what I can do to stop it. Maybe there's something wrong with my balance? Or my medications? My daughter thinks I should move into an aged care facility but I want to stay at home as long as possible."</p>

            <h3>Emotional State</h3>
            <p>Patient appears anxious but cooperative. She's motivated to prevent further falls because she wants to maintain independence. Slightly tearful when discussing fear of nursing home placement.</p>

            <h2>📝 Model Answer - Summary</h2>
            <h3>Patient Summary</h3>
            <p><strong>"This is Mrs. Margaret Robertson, an 82-year-old woman presenting after her second fall in 4 months. Both falls were mechanical (trip), but she has MULTIPLE MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS including recent medication change (ramipril increase causing postural hypotension), polypharmacy (5 medications including temazepam - fall-risk medication), vision impairment (cataracts), home hazards (loose rugs, poor lighting), and fear of falling leading to reduced activity. This requires comprehensive multifactorial falls prevention intervention."</strong></p>

            <h3>Risk Factors Identified</h3>

            <p><strong>INTRINSIC (Medical) Risk Factors:</strong></p>
            <ol>

                <li>🚨 <strong>POLYPHARMACY</strong> - 5 medications</li>
                <li>🚨 <strong>FALL-RISK MEDICATIONS:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Temazepam (benzodiazepine - sedation, impaired balance)</li>
                        <li>Amlodipine + Ramipril (antihypertensives - postural hypotension)</li>
                        <li>Ramipril RECENTLY INCREASED (temporal association with falls)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>🚨 <strong>POSTURAL HYPOTENSION</strong> - dizzy on standing (worse since ramipril increase)</li>
                <li>🚨 <strong>VISION IMPAIRMENT</strong> - bilateral cataracts, blurry vision</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced mobility</strong> - uses walking stick, osteoarthritis knees/hips</li>
                <li><strong>Muscle weakness</strong> - legs feel weak, arthritis limits activity</li>
                <li><strong>Nocturia</strong> - gets up 2-3 times/night (rushing in dark)</li>
                <li><strong>Peripheral neuropathy</strong> - numbness in toes</li>

            <h3>Immediate Management Plan - NSW Health Falls Prevention Guidelines 2024</h3>

            <h4>1. URGENT Medication Review (TODAY):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>🚨 <strong>STOP Temazepam immediately</strong> - benzodiazepines are HIGH RISK for falls in elderly (eTG 2024 - avoid in >65 years)</li>
                <li>🚨 <strong>REDUCE Ramipril back to 5mg</strong> (previous dose) - recent increase likely causing postural hypotension</li>
                <li><strong>Monitor lying/standing blood pressure</strong> - confirm postural drop</li>
                <li><strong>Alternative for insomnia:</strong> Sleep hygiene advice, consider melatonin 2mg nocte (safer alternative)</li>
                <li><strong>Continue:</strong> Amlodipine (but monitor BP), atorvastatin, paracetamol</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. Vision Assessment (URGENT - within 2 weeks):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Refer to ophthalmology</strong> - cataract surgery assessment</li>
                <li><strong>Interim:</strong> Update glasses prescription</li>
                <li><strong>Cataract surgery</strong> reduces fall risk by 30-40%</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. Home Safety Assessment:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Occupational therapy HOME VISIT</strong> - comprehensive environmental assessment</li>
                <li><strong>Immediate recommendations:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>REMOVE or secure loose rugs with non-slip backing</li>
                        <li>INSTALL brighter light bulbs in hallway (60-100W)</li>
                        <li>INSTALL night lights in bedroom/hallway/bathroom</li>
                        <li>INSTALL grab rails in bathroom (shower, toilet)</li>
                        <li>REPLACE loose slippers with supportive, non-slip footwear</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Consider:</strong> Personal alarm system (pendant alarm) for if falls when alone</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>4. Falls Prevention Exercise Program:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physiotherapy referral</strong> - strength and balance retraining</li>
                <li><strong>Group-based exercise program:</strong> e.g., Stepping On program (evidence-based - reduces falls by 30%)</li>
                <li><strong>Home exercise program:</strong> Daily balance exercises, strengthening</li>
                <li><strong>Walking aid review:</strong> Check stick is correct height, consider 4-wheel walker for outdoor stability</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>5. Bone Health Assessment (Secondary Prevention):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bone density scan (DEXA)</strong> - assess for osteoporosis</li>
                <li><strong>Calcium and vitamin D:</strong> Caltrate D 600mg/400IU daily OR Ostelin Vitamin D 1000IU daily</li>
                <li><strong>If osteoporosis:</strong> Consider bisphosphonate (alendronate) - reduces fracture risk</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>6. Manage Nocturia:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fluid restriction after 6pm</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Toileting before bed</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Commode beside bed</strong> (reduce need to walk to bathroom at night in poor light)</li>
                <li><strong>Night lights</strong> (bedroom → bathroom route)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>7. Address Fear of Falling:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Acknowledge concerns:</strong> "It's very understandable you're worried. We're going to work together to make you safer"</li>
                <li><strong>Goal setting:</strong> "What activities would you like to get back to?" (e.g., walking group)</li>
                <li><strong>Graduated return to activity:</strong> Start with supervised walking, build confidence</li>
                <li><strong>Falls prevention education:</strong> Written information, support groups</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>8. Follow-up Plan:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Review in 1 week:</strong> Check BP lying/standing after medication changes</li>
                <li><strong>Review in 4-6 weeks:</strong> Reassess falls risk, check exercise program adherence</li>
                <li><strong>Multidisciplinary team:</strong> GP + Physiotherapist + Occupational Therapist + Ophthalmologist</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Expected Outcome with Intervention:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Medication optimization → reduce postural hypotension, remove sedation</li>
                <li>Cataract surgery → improved vision</li>
                <li>Home modifications → remove environmental hazards</li>
                <li>Exercise program → improve strength, balance, confidence</li>
                <li><strong>Estimated fall risk reduction: 50-70% with comprehensive multifactorial intervention</strong></li>
            </ul>
