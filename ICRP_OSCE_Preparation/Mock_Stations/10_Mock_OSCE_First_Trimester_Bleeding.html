            <p><strong>Time:</strong> 8 minutes</p>
            <p><strong>Setting:</strong> Emergency Department, Young District Hospital, NSW</p>
            <p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Advanced (Life-threatening emergency recognition)</p>

        <!-- SECTION 1: CANDIDATE INSTRUCTIONS -->
        <div class="section candidate-instructions">
            <h2>📋 Candidate Instructions</h2>

            <h3>Scenario</h3>
            <p>You are the RMO on call in the Emergency Department at Young District Hospital. You have been asked to assess Ms. Emma Collins, a 28-year-old woman who has presented with vaginal bleeding and lower abdominal pain. She mentions that her period is "late."</p>

            <h3>Your Task (8 minutes)</h3>
            <p><strong>Take a focused history</strong> to identify the cause of her bleeding and assess for life-threatening complications. You do NOT need to examine the patient.</p>

            <h3>You Should Cover:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Menstrual and pregnancy history</li>
                <li>Bleeding characteristics</li>
                <li>Abdominal pain assessment</li>
                <li>🚨 Red flags for ectopic pregnancy (ruptured vs unruptured)</li>
                <li>Risk factors for ectopic pregnancy</li>
                <li>Past obstetric and gynaecological history</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="warning">
                <strong>⏰ Time Warning:</strong> The examiner will give you a 1-minute warning at the 7-minute mark to allow you to summarize your findings and state your differential diagnosis and initial management.
            </div>

            <div class="warning">
                <strong>🚨 CRITICAL:</strong> Ectopic pregnancy is a LIFE-THREATENING emergency. A ruptured ectopic can cause massive intraperitoneal haemorrhage and hypovolemic shock. This station tests your ability to recognize red flags and initiate urgent management.
            </div>

            <div class="tip">
                <strong>💡 Australian Context:</strong> First trimester bleeding affects 20-30% of pregnancies. Ectopic pregnancy occurs in 1-2% of pregnancies but accounts for 6% of maternal deaths in Australia (RANZCOG 2024). Examiners expect systematic assessment, recognition of red flags, and appropriate urgency in management.

            <h3>Patient Concerns (ICE)</h3>

            <h4>If Asked "What do you think is happening?"</h4>
            <p>"I'm worried I'm having a miscarriage. But I'm also scared because I read online that bleeding in early pregnancy can sometimes mean an ectopic pregnancy - where the baby is in the tube instead of the womb. Is that what this could be?"</p>

            <h4>If Asked "What are you most worried about?"</h4>
            <p>"I'm worried about losing the baby. My partner and I were actually excited when we saw the positive test, even though it wasn't planned. But I'm also worried that something really serious is wrong - the pain is getting worse and I keep feeling like I'm going to faint."</p>

            <h4>If Asked "What were you hoping we could do?"</h4>
            <p>"I need to know what's happening. If it's a miscarriage, I need to know. If it's something more serious, I want to be safe. Can you do a scan to see where the pregnancy is?"</p>

            <h3>Emotional State</h3>
            <p>Patient is anxious and worried, fighting back tears. She's clutching her partner's hand (partner sitting beside her). She's cooperative with history-taking but clearly in pain and frightened. She becomes more tearful when asked about concerns for the pregnancy.</p>

            <h2>🎓 Examiner Instructions</h2>

            <h3>Your Role</h3>
            <p>You are observing a history-taking station for first trimester bleeding. This is a HIGH-STAKES station testing the candidate's ability to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Systematically assess first trimester bleeding</li>
                <li>Recognize red flags for ECTOPIC PREGNANCY (life-threatening emergency)</li>
                <li>Differentiate ectopic pregnancy from threatened/inevitable miscarriage</li>
                <li>Identify risk factors for ectopic pregnancy</li>
                <li>Demonstrate appropriate urgency and empathy</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Station Objectives</h3>
            <p>This station assesses the candidate's ability to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Take a systematic obstetric/gynaecological history</li>
                <li>Identify RED FLAGS for ectopic pregnancy (shoulder tip pain, orthostatic symptoms, unilateral pain)</li>
                <li>Assess risk factors (PID, previous ectopic, IVF, etc.)</li>
                <li>Differentiate ruptured vs unruptured ectopic vs miscarriage</li>
                <li>Demonstrate empathy with distressed patient</li>
                <li>Formulate appropriate differential diagnosis and urgent management plan</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Key Clinical Features - Red Flags for Ectopic 🚨</h3>
            <p><strong>This Patient Has Multiple Red Flags:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>🚨🚨 <strong>Shoulder tip pain</strong> (PATHOGNOMONIC - diaphragmatic irritation from intraperitoneal blood)</li>
                <li>🚨🚨 <strong>Orthostatic symptoms</strong> (lightheaded on standing - suggests haemoperitoneum)</li>
                <li>🚨 <strong>Unilateral pain</strong> (right iliac fossa - suggests tubal location)</li>
                <li>🚨 <strong>Progressive pain</strong> (worsening over 3 days - suggests tubal distension)</li>
                <li>🚨 <strong>Previous PID</strong> (from chlamydia - 6× increased risk of ectopic)</li>
                <li>🚨 <strong>Amenorrhoea 7 weeks</strong> (typical timing for ectopic presentation)</li>
                <li>🚨 <strong>Positive pregnancy test</strong> (confirms pregnancy)</li>
                <li>Light vaginal bleeding (minimal - typical for ectopic, NOT heavy like miscarriage)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="fail-criteria">
                <h4>🚨 CRITICAL RED FLAGS (Failure to identify = patient death)</h4>
                <p><strong>These 3 features indicate HIGH RISK of rupture or already ruptured ectopic:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Shoulder tip pain</strong> = diaphragmatic irritation from blood in peritoneal cavity</li>
                    <li><strong>Orthostatic symptoms</strong> (lightheaded on standing, near-syncope) = significant blood loss</li>
                    <li><strong>Progressive unilateral pain</strong> = tubal distension, high risk of imminent rupture</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>If candidate misses ALL THREE red flags → automatic fail (patient would die)</strong></p>
            </div>

            <h3>Timing Instructions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Allow 7 minutes for history taking</li>
                <li>Give 1-minute warning at 7 minutes</li>
                <li>Ask for summary, differential diagnosis, and initial management in final minute</li>
                <li>Total station time: 8 minutes</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Expected Summary</h3>
            <p>The candidate should provide a concise summary including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Patient demographics and presenting complaint</li>
                <li>🚨 <strong>RED FLAGS identified</strong> (shoulder tip pain, orthostatic symptoms, unilateral pain)</li>
                <li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> "Right tubal ectopic pregnancy (high risk of rupture/already ruptured)"</li>
                <li><strong>Differential:</strong> Also mention miscarriage, but state ectopic is most likely</li>
                <li><strong>Immediate management:</strong> Resuscitation (IV access, fluids), urgent βhCG, urgent ultrasound, URGENT O&G review for possible emergency surgery</li>
                <li>Demonstrate URGENCY (this is an emergency)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Patient Summary</h3>
            <p><strong>"This is Emma Collins, a 28-year-old woman, G1P0, presenting with vaginal bleeding and right-sided abdominal pain at 7 weeks gestation. She has MULTIPLE RED FLAGS suggesting RIGHT TUBAL ECTOPIC PREGNANCY with HIGH RISK of rupture or possible early rupture. This is a SURGICAL EMERGENCY requiring URGENT obstetric review."</strong></p>

            <h3>Key Positive Findings (Red Flags 🚨)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>🚨🚨 <strong>Shoulder tip pain</strong> (right shoulder - PATHOGNOMONIC for haemoperitoneum/diaphragmatic irritation)</li>
                <li>🚨🚨 <strong>Orthostatic symptoms</strong> (lightheaded on standing, near-syncope - suggests significant blood loss)</li>
                <li>🚨 <strong>Progressive RIGHT iliac fossa pain</strong> (unilateral - suggests tubal location, worsening over 3 days - suggests tubal distension/imminent rupture)</li>
                <li>🚨 <strong>Previous PID from chlamydia</strong> (3 years ago - tubal damage increases ectopic risk 6-fold)</li>
                <li>🚨 <strong>Amenorrhoea 7 weeks</strong> (typical timing for ectopic presentation - 6-10 weeks)</li>
                <li><strong>Positive home pregnancy test</strong> (confirms pregnancy)</li>
                <li><strong>Minimal vaginal bleeding</strong> (light spotting, dark blood - typical for ectopic, NOT heavy)</li>
                <li><strong>No ultrasound yet</strong> (intrauterine pregnancy NOT confirmed)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Negative Findings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>❌ No syncope/collapse (yet - but patient had near-syncope episode)</li>
                <li>❌ No heavy bleeding (rules out inevitable miscarriage)</li>
                <li>❌ No tissue passed (rules out incomplete/complete miscarriage)</li>
                <li>❌ No fever (rules out septic miscarriage/PID)</li>
                <li>❌ No previous ectopic pregnancy</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Immediate Management - eTG & RANZCOG 2024 Guidelines</h3>

            <h4>🚨 PRIORITY: This is a SURGICAL EMERGENCY</h4>

            <p><strong>Clinical Status: UNSTABLE (orthostatic hypotension, shoulder tip pain, progressive pain)</strong></p>

            <h4>1. Initial Assessment & Resuscitation (SIMULTANEOUS)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>🚨 URGENT O&G REVIEW</strong> - Call O&G registrar/consultant IMMEDIATELY (within 10 minutes)</li>
                <li><strong>ABC assessment:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Airway: Patent</li>
                        <li>Breathing: Assess respiratory rate, oxygen saturations</li>
                        <li>Circulation: <strong>🚨 HIGH PRIORITY</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Heart rate, blood pressure (check for hypotension)</li>
                                <li>Capillary refill time</li>
                                <li>Assess for shock (tachycardia, hypotension, pallor, cold peripheries)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Continuous monitoring:</strong> HR, BP, RR, SpO₂ every 15 minutes</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. Immediate Resuscitation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>IV access:</strong> <strong>TWO</strong> large-bore cannulae (14-16G) 🚨</li>
                <li><strong>IV fluids:</strong> Sodium chloride 0.9% OR Hartmann's solution
                    <ul>
                        <li>If haemodynamically STABLE: 125-250 mL/hour</li>
                        <li>If haemodynamically UNSTABLE (hypotensive, tachycardic): FLUID BOLUS 500-1000 mL STAT</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Nil by mouth (NBM)</strong> - likely to require emergency surgery</li>
                <li><strong>Analgesia:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Paracetamol 1g IV</li>
                        <li>Morphine 2.5-5mg IV PRN (careful - can mask symptoms, but patient in significant pain)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Anti-emetics:</strong> Ondansetron 4-8mg IV (if nauseated)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. Urgent Investigations (Bedside + Lab)</h4>

            <p><strong>Bedside:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>🚨 Bedside transvaginal ultrasound</strong> (if available in ED and operator experienced):
                    <ul>
                        <li>Look for intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) - if IUP seen, ectopic highly unlikely (heterotopic pregnancy <1:30,000)</li>
                        <li>Look for free fluid in pouch of Douglas (blood from ruptured ectopic)</li>
                        <li>Look for adnexal mass (ectopic gestational sac)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>ECG:</strong> Baseline (pre-operative if surgery needed)</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>🚨 βhCG (serum)</strong> - CRITICAL
                    <ul>
                        <li>Confirms pregnancy</li>
                        <li>Quantitative level helps interpret ultrasound</li>
                        <li>βhCG >1500 IU/L = should see IUP on transvaginal US (if no IUP seen → ectopic until proven otherwise)</li>
                        <li>Single βhCG of limited value - trend more useful (48-hour repeat if stable)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Full blood count (FBC):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Haemoglobin (Hb) - assess for anaemia from blood loss</li>
                        <li>Note: Hb may be NORMAL initially (takes hours for haemodilution) - clinical assessment more important</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Blood group & antibody screen:</strong> ESSENTIAL for:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Group & hold (may need emergency transfusion)</li>
                        <li>Rh status - if Rh NEGATIVE → needs Anti-D immunoglobulin (within 72 hours)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Coagulation studies (INR, APTT):</strong> If suspect massive haemorrhage or pre-operative</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>4. Definitive Imaging</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>🚨 Formal transvaginal ultrasound scan (URGENT - within 1-2 hours)</strong>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Intrauterine gestational sac (confirms IUP if seen with yolk sac/fetal pole)</li>
                                <li>Adnexal mass (ectopic gestational sac ± fetal heartbeat)</li>
                                <li>Free fluid in pelvis/abdomen (blood from ruptured ectopic)</li>
                                <li>Empty uterus (concerning for ectopic if βhCG >1500)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

            <h4>5. Urgent Specialist Review</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>🚨 Obstetrics & Gynaecology (O&G) registrar/consultant</strong> - URGENT within 30 minutes</li>
                <li><strong>Decision for management:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If UNSTABLE (hypotensive, tachycardic, significant free fluid on scan) → <strong>EMERGENCY LAPAROSCOPY/LAPAROTOMY</strong></li>
                        <li>If STABLE + confirmed ectopic → Medical vs surgical management (see below)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Option 2: MEDICAL MANAGEMENT (If Unruptured, Stable, Early)</h4>

            <p><strong>Criteria for Medical Management (ALL must be met):</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Success rate:</strong> 70-80% (spontaneous resolution)</p>
            <p><strong>NOT SUITABLE for this patient</strong> - unstable, symptomatic, high risk of rupture</p>

            <h3>Anti-D Immunoglobulin (If Rh Negative)</h3>

            <p><strong>This patient is O Rh NEGATIVE → requires Anti-D</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Indication:</strong> All Rh-negative women with bleeding in pregnancy, miscarriage, or ectopic pregnancy</li>
                <li><strong>Dose:</strong> 250 IU (50 micrograms) IM if <12 weeks gestation</li>
                <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Within 72 hours of bleeding onset (ideally within 72 hours, but can give up to 10 days)</li>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Prevent Rh sensitisation (alloimmunisation) which can cause haemolytic disease in future pregnancies</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Prognosis & Follow-up</h3>

            <h4>Short-term:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>If surgery:</strong> Hospital stay 1-3 days, recovery 2-4 weeks</li>
                <li><strong>If medical (methotrexate):</strong> Weekly βhCG monitoring until undetectable (4-6 weeks)</li>
                <li><strong>Psychological support:</strong> Early pregnancy loss - offer counselling, support groups</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Long-term - Future Fertility:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>After salpingectomy (one tube removed):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Future pregnancy rate: 60-70% (with one functioning tube)</li>
                        <li>Recurrent ectopic risk: 10% (vs 1-2% general population)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Future pregnancy rate: 60-80%</li>
                        <li>Recurrent ectopic risk: 15% (higher than salpingectomy due to tubal damage)</li>
                        <li>Persistent trophoblast risk: 5-8% (requires methotrexate)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Advise:</strong> Early ultrasound scan (6-7 weeks) in ALL future pregnancies to confirm IUP</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Red Flags to Warn Patient About (If Discharged - NOT this patient)</h3>

            <p><em>Note: This patient should be ADMITTED, NOT discharged. But for completeness:</em></p>

            <ul>
                <li>🚨 Severe or increasing abdominal pain → return immediately</li>
                <li>🚨 Shoulder tip pain → return immediately</li>
                <li>🚨 Feeling faint, dizzy, or about to collapse → call ambulance</li>
                <li>🚨 Heavy vaginal bleeding (soaking >2 pads/hour) → return immediately</li>
                <li>🚨 Severe nausea/vomiting → contact O&G team</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Patient Counseling - What to Tell Emma</h3>

            <p><strong>Initial Discussion (in ED):</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Acknowledge concerns:</strong> "I can see you're worried and in pain. We're going to work out what's happening and make sure you're safe."</li>
                <li><strong>Explain suspicion:</strong> "Based on your symptoms - the pain on one side, the shoulder pain, and feeling lightheaded - I'm concerned this might be an ectopic pregnancy. That's where the pregnancy develops in the tube instead of the womb."</li>
                <li><strong>Urgency:</strong> "This is something we need to investigate urgently because it can be serious. I'm going to arrange some blood tests and an urgent ultrasound scan, and I've called the obstetrics team to come and see you straight away."</li>
                <li><strong>Management:</strong> "We're going to put a drip in your arm to give you fluids, and we'll give you some pain relief. The obstetrics team will see you shortly and explain the next steps. You might need an operation to fix this."</li>
                <li><strong>Support:</strong> "I know this is frightening. Your partner can stay with you, and we'll keep you informed every step of the way."</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Later Discussion (by O&G team - if ectopic confirmed):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Confirm diagnosis: "The ultrasound shows the pregnancy is in your right tube, not in your womb. This is called an ectopic pregnancy."</li>
                <li>Explain why serious: "Unfortunately, the tube can't support a pregnancy - it can burst (rupture) and cause serious internal bleeding. That's why you're having shoulder pain and feeling faint - there may already be some bleeding."</li>
                <li>Treatment options: "We need to remove the ectopic pregnancy. The safest way is with keyhole surgery (laparoscopy). We'll likely need to remove the affected tube, but you'll still have your left tube and can have normal pregnancies in the future."</li>
                <li>Prognosis: "Most women who've had one ectopic pregnancy go on to have successful pregnancies - about 60-70% chance of conceiving naturally. In any future pregnancy, we'll scan you early to make sure it's in the right place."</li>
                <li>Emotional support: "I'm sorry this is happening. Losing a pregnancy is very difficult, even this early. We can arrange counselling and support for you and your partner."</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Australian-Specific Considerations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Terminology:</strong> "O&G team" (not "OB/GYN"), "theatre" (not "OR"), "paracetamol" (not "acetaminophen")</li>
                <li><strong>Guidelines:</strong> RANZCOG (Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists) Ectopic Pregnancy Guidelines 2024</li>
                <li><strong>eTG 2024:</strong> First-line antibiotic if septic miscarriage suspected: Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5g IV + gentamicin 5-7mg/kg IV</li>
                <li><strong>Anti-D:</strong> 250 IU (50 micrograms) for <12 weeks (Australian dosing - differs from UK 250 IU for all trimesters)</li>
                <li><strong>Referral pathway:</strong> ED → O&G registrar → O&G consultant → Theatre if surgical</li>
                <li><strong>Follow-up:</strong> O&G outpatient clinic 4-6 weeks post-surgery OR weekly if medical management</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- SECTION 6: IMG COMMON MISTAKES -->
        <div class="section img-mistakes">
            <h2>⚠️ IMG Common Mistakes - Critical Errors to Avoid</h2>

            <p><strong>Ectopic pregnancy is the LEADING cause of maternal death in the first trimester. Missing this diagnosis = patient death. These 10 mistakes are commonly made by IMG candidates and will lead to automatic failure.</strong></p>

            <div class="mistake">
                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #1: Not Asking About Shoulder Tip Pain</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> Shoulder tip pain is PATHOGNOMONIC (diagnostic) for haemoperitoneum (blood in the peritoneal cavity irritating the diaphragm, causing referred pain to C3-C5 dermatome = shoulder). Missing this means you miss a ruptured or near-ruptured ectopic pregnancy. This is a CRITICAL FAILURE.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> IMG candidates focus on abdominal/pelvic symptoms and forget to specifically ask "Do you have any shoulder pain?" This is a MUST-ASK question in ALL first trimester bleeding cases.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Why patients don't volunteer this:</strong> Patients don't connect shoulder pain with pregnancy bleeding - they think they "slept funny." YOU must ask specifically.
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: In EVERY first trimester bleeding case, you MUST ask: "Have you had any pain in your shoulder or shoulder tip?" This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. If answer is YES → ruptured/rupturing ectopic until proven otherwise → EMERGENCY.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #2: Not Asking About Feeling Faint/Dizzy (Orthostatic Symptoms)</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> Orthostatic symptoms (feeling faint when standing up, lightheaded, near-syncope) indicate hypovolemia from internal bleeding. This is a RED FLAG for significant haemoperitoneum. Not asking about this means you don't recognize the patient is bleeding internally and may collapse.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> IMG candidates ask about pain and bleeding but don't systematically assess for signs of blood loss (dizziness, feeling faint, syncope). Australian OSCE expects this as standard practice.
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: Ask "Have you felt dizzy or lightheaded?" "Have you felt faint or like you might pass out?" "Have you actually fainted or collapsed?" If YES to any → suggests blood loss → ruptured ectopic possible → EMERGENCY.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #3: Not Differentiating Unilateral vs Bilateral Abdominal Pain</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> UNILATERAL (one-sided) pain strongly suggests ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy in left or right tube). BILATERAL or central pain is more consistent with miscarriage (intrauterine pregnancy loss). Not asking "Is the pain on one side or both?" means you miss a critical diagnostic clue.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> IMG candidates ask "Where is the pain?" but don't specifically clarify ONE side vs BOTH sides. The patient says "my stomach" or "down low" and the candidate doesn't follow up with "Which side specifically?"
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: Ask "Is the pain mainly on one side, or is it in the middle/both sides?" If patient says ONE SIDE (right or left iliac fossa) → ectopic pregnancy is MOST LIKELY diagnosis. Central/bilateral = more consistent with miscarriage.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #4: Not Asking About Previous Pelvic Infection (PID/Chlamydia)</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> Previous pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) - especially from chlamydia or gonorrhoea - is the BIGGEST modifiable risk factor for ectopic pregnancy. PID causes tubal scarring and damage, preventing the embryo from traveling to the uterus. PID increases ectopic risk 6-10 fold. Not asking = missing major risk factor.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> IMG candidates are often embarrassed or uncomfortable asking about sexual history/STIs. In Australian medical culture, asking about STI history is ROUTINE and expected. Not asking is considered incomplete history.
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: Ask matter-of-factly "Have you ever had any pelvic infections in the past?" "Have you ever been diagnosed with chlamydia, gonorrhoea, or pelvic inflammatory disease?" This is standard sexual health history in Australia. Don't be embarrassed - it's essential information.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #5: Not Confirming Pregnancy Status (Pregnancy Test Done? Result?)</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> You cannot diagnose ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage if you don't confirm the patient is actually pregnant. Surprisingly, some IMG candidates assume the patient is pregnant based on "missed period" without explicitly asking "Have you done a pregnancy test? What was the result?"
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> Patient mentions "late period" and candidate jumps to pregnancy-related diagnoses without confirming pregnancy. Could be other causes of amenorrhoea + bleeding (anovulatory cycle, PCOS, etc.).
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: ALWAYS ask: "Have you done a pregnancy test?" "When did you do it?" "What was the result?" Confirm POSITIVE pregnancy test before pursuing ectopic/miscarriage differentials. If no test done → offer bedside urine βhCG in ED.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #6: Not Asking if Ultrasound Scan Done (IUP Confirmed?)</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> If an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) has been CONFIRMED on ultrasound (gestational sac in uterus with yolk sac/fetal pole), then ectopic pregnancy is almost impossible (heterotopic pregnancy = IUP + ectopic = 1 in 30,000, except 1 in 3,000 with IVF). Not asking about previous scans means you don't know if IUP is confirmed.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> IMG candidates assume if pregnancy test is positive, they need to differentiate ectopic vs miscarriage. But if IUP already confirmed on scan, ectopic is essentially ruled out.
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: Ask "Have you had any ultrasound scans yet?" "Did they see the pregnancy in your womb?" If YES (IUP confirmed) → ectopic extremely unlikely, focus on miscarriage differentials. If NO (no scan yet) → ectopic vs miscarriage both possible.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #7: Not Asking About Blood Group (Rh Status)</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> If patient is Rh NEGATIVE, she MUST receive Anti-D immunoglobulin within 72 hours of any bleeding in pregnancy, miscarriage, or ectopic pregnancy. Failure to give Anti-D can cause alloimmunisation, leading to haemolytic disease of the newborn in future pregnancies (potentially fatal for future babies). Not asking about blood group = missing critical preventive treatment.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> IMG candidates from countries where Anti-D protocols differ may not ask about Rh status. In Australia, asking blood group is STANDARD in any pregnancy-related consultation.
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: Ask "Do you know your blood group?" If patient is Rh NEGATIVE (O neg, A neg, B neg, AB neg) OR unknown → document need for Anti-D. If Rh POSITIVE → Anti-D not needed. If unknown → check with lab urgently + give Anti-D if time-critical.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #8: Not Recognizing URGENCY - Treating as Routine First Trimester Bleeding</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> This patient has MULTIPLE red flags (shoulder tip pain, orthostatic symptoms, unilateral pain, previous PID). This is a SURGICAL EMERGENCY, not routine first trimester bleeding. If candidate suggests "arrange outpatient ultrasound" or "follow up with GP" → patient could rupture and die. This is a patient safety CRITICAL FAILURE.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> IMG candidates recognize "first trimester bleeding" but don't triage urgency. They think "ectopic is possible" but don't communicate that this requires IMMEDIATE O&G review. Australian OSCE expects you to demonstrate urgency when it's warranted.
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: When presenting your summary, use language that conveys URGENCY: "This is a 28-year-old woman with suspected ruptured ectopic pregnancy - this is a SURGICAL EMERGENCY requiring URGENT obstetric review within 30 minutes. I would call the O&G registrar immediately while starting resuscitation with two large-bore IV cannulae and fluids." Show you understand this is life-threatening.

            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #9: Not Assessing Severity of Bleeding (Quantifying Pad Use)</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> "Vaginal bleeding" can mean anything from spotting (few drops) to torrential haemorrhage (soaking multiple pads per hour). Ectopic pregnancy typically has LIGHT bleeding (spotting), whereas inevitable/incomplete miscarriage has HEAVY bleeding. Not quantifying bleeding means you can't differentiate.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> IMG candidates ask "How much bleeding?" and patient says "some bleeding" - candidate doesn't follow up with "How many pads have you used?" or "Are you soaking through pads?"
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: Quantify bleeding: "How many pads or panty liners have you used in the last 24 hours?" "Are you soaking through pads, or just spotting?" LIGHT bleeding (spotting, 1-2 pads/day) is MORE consistent with ectopic. HEAVY bleeding (>1 pad/hour) is MORE consistent with miscarriage.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #10: Poor Empathy - Not Acknowledging Patient's Distress</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> This patient is losing her first pregnancy, is in pain, frightened, and potentially facing emergency surgery. If candidate launches into clinical questioning without acknowledging her distress ("I can see you're worried and in pain"), they fail the communication/empathy domain. Australian OSCE heavily weights empathy, especially in emotionally charged scenarios like pregnancy loss.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> IMG candidates focus intensely on "getting the history right" and forget to connect with the patient emotionally. They ask rapid-fire questions without pausing to acknowledge the patient is crying or distressed.
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: Start with empathy: "I can see you're in pain and this is very worrying for you. I'm going to ask you some questions to work out what's happening, and we'll make sure you're safe and get the right treatment." Pause when patient is tearful. Offer tissue.

                <li>✅ Ask about feeling faint/dizzy - orthostatic symptoms from blood loss</li>
                <li>✅ Ask if pain is ONE SIDE or BOTH SIDES - unilateral = ectopic</li>
                <li>✅ Ask about previous PID/chlamydia - MAJOR risk factor (6× risk)</li>
                <li>✅ Confirm pregnancy test done and result - don't assume</li>
                <li>✅ Ask if ultrasound scan done - IUP confirmed rules out ectopic</li>
                <li>✅ Ask about blood group (Rh status) - Anti-D needed if Rh negative</li>
                <li>✅ Quantify bleeding severity - light bleeding = ectopic, heavy = miscarriage</li>
                <li>✅ Demonstrate URGENCY - ectopic is an EMERGENCY, not routine</li>

                <h4>🎯 IMG Success Tips for First Trimester Bleeding Stations:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Memorize the ECTOPIC RED FLAGS:</strong> Shoulder tip pain, orthostatic symptoms, unilateral pain, previous PID, amenorrhoea 6-10 weeks. If ANY present → ectopic until proven otherwise.</li>
                    <li><strong>Practice saying "Have you had any shoulder pain?":</strong> This question alone can save a life. Make it automatic in your first trimester bleeding history.</li>
                    <li><strong>Learn the typical presentations:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ectopic: LIGHT bleeding + ONE-SIDED pain + shoulder pain/dizziness</li>
                            <li>Threatened miscarriage: LIGHT bleeding + central cramping + IUP on scan</li>
                            <li>Inevitable miscarriage: HEAVY bleeding + clots/tissue + open cervix</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Know when to panic:</strong> Shoulder tip pain + orthostatic symptoms = ruptured ectopic = call O&G NOW, get IV access, prepare for emergency theatre. Show urgency in your body language and tone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't forget Anti-D:</strong> If patient is Rh negative → Anti-D within 72 hours. Mention this in your management plan.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be systematic:</strong> Even in an emergency, use a structure: Menstrual history → Bleeding history → Pain history → Red flags → Risk factors → Past history. This prevents you missing key questions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communicate urgency:</strong> Use words like "URGENT," "EMERGENCY," "IMMEDIATELY" when appropriate. Don't be wishy-washy - "This might need urgent review" is weak. Say "This requires URGENT O&G review within 30 minutes."</li>
