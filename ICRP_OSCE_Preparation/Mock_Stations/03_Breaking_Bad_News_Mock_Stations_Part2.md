### MODEL ANSWER

**[Opening - 30 sec]**
"Hello Mr Pappas, Mrs Pappas. I'm Dr [Name], one of the doctors looking after George on the stroke unit. *[Sit down]* I wanted to meet with you both to talk about George's stroke, how he's recovering, and what to expect going forward. *[To patient]* George, I know speaking is difficult for you right now, but I want to include you in this conversation. Please let me know if you want me to slow down or repeat anything."

**[Explaining Stroke - 90 sec]**
"First, let me explain what happened. *[Look at George]* George, you had a stroke five days ago. A stroke happens when blood flow to part of the brain is blocked. Without blood flow, brain cells die.

*[Point to left side of own head]* The stroke was on the left side of your brain. The left side of the brain controls the right side of the body - that's why your right arm and leg are weak. The left side also controls speech for most people - that's why you're having difficulty speaking.

Right now, George has three main problems from the stroke:
1. Right-sided weakness - you can't walk yet, and your right arm has limited movement
2. Speech difficulty - you know what you want to say, but the words don't come out right. This is called aphasia.
3. Swallowing difficulty - you're not able to swallow safely, which is why you have the feeding tube.

Does that make sense so far?"

**[Prognosis - CRITICAL - 120 sec]**
*[Wife asks: "He's going to get better, right? Back to normal?"]*

"I need to talk honestly with you about recovery, and I know this is difficult to hear. *[Pause]*

Recovery from stroke is possible, but it takes time - months to years, not days or weeks. The brain has been damaged. That damage is permanent. However, the brain can sometimes learn to work around the damage through rehabilitation.

Based on the size and location of George's stroke, we expect some recovery, but probably not complete recovery. *[Pause - let this sink in]*

It's very difficult to predict exactly how much someone will recover. Some people with strokes like George's do learn to walk again, but usually with aids like a walker or cane. Some people need a wheelchair. We won't know George's final outcome for many months - probably 6 to 12 months.

*[To wife, gently]* I want to be honest: it's unlikely he'll get back to exactly how he was before the stroke.

*[To George]* I know this is incredibly frustrating for you, and I'm sorry this has happened."

**[Addressing Emotions - 60 sec]**
*[Wife crying]*
"*[Hand tissues]* This is overwhelming. Your life has changed suddenly and dramatically. *[To wife]* You're grieving for the life you had before the stroke. That's completely understandable.

*[To George]* And George, I can see you're frustrated. Anyone would be. It's incredibly hard to lose abilities you've always had.

This is a huge adjustment for both of you."

**[Rehabilitation - 120 sec]**
"Let me talk about what happens next. George will need intensive rehabilitation.

You'll stay here on the stroke unit for probably another 1-2 weeks while we make sure you're medically stable. Then you'll transfer to a rehabilitation hospital.

At rehab, you'll work with a team of specialists:
- Physiotherapists will work on strength, balance, and walking
- Occupational therapists will help with daily activities like dressing and eating
- Speech therapists will work on your speech and swallowing
- Rehabilitation doctors will coordinate your care

Rehabilitation usually takes 4-8 weeks in hospital, sometimes longer. After that, you'll continue therapy as an outpatient - probably several times per week for months.

The rehab team will work with you to set goals. Goals might be things like: walking with a frame, dressing yourself, speaking in short sentences, safe swallowing. We take it step by step."

**[Feeding Tube - 30 sec]**
"The feeding tube will stay in place until swallowing is safe. Speech therapy will work on swallowing exercises. Some people regain safe swallow, some don't. If you don't regain safe swallow, the tube can stay long-term - many people live well with feeding tubes."

**[Home - 60 sec]**
*[Wife asks: "Can he come home? Our bedroom is upstairs."]*

"That's our goal - to get George home - but it depends on how much recovery he makes and what support you have. Before discharge, an occupational therapist will visit your house and recommend modifications - like ramps if there are steps, grab rails in the bathroom, maybe a bedroom downstairs if you have stairs.

Many stroke survivors do go home, but they often need ongoing support - either from family or paid carers. That's something we'll plan carefully."

**[Support for Wife - 60 sec]**
*[To wife]* "Mrs Pappas, this is going to be very hard on you too. Being a carer is physically and emotionally exhausting. You mentioned you're 66 - lifting and moving George will be difficult.

Please don't try to do everything yourself. There are support services available:
- My Aged Care can organize a home care package - this can include help with cleaning, meals, personal care
- There are carer support groups - Carers Australia can provide information
- Your own health matters too. Please see your doctor for your own care.

And the Stroke Foundation has resources and support groups - I'll give you their information."

**[Closing - 30 sec]**
"*[To both]* I know this is overwhelming. George, you've had a significant stroke that's affected your movement, speech, and swallowing. Recovery will take many months of hard work. We can't promise you'll get back to exactly how you were, but we'll work to help you recover as much function as possible.

Do you have questions right now? *[Pause for questions]*

We'll have regular meetings during your rehab to update you on progress."

### MODEL ANSWER

**[Preparation - before entering room]**
- Ensure nurse accompanies
- Take deep breath
- Remove pager/phone

**[Entering - 20 sec]**
*[Enter with nurse]*
*[Wife jumps up: "Doctor! Is he okay?!"]*
"Mrs Chen, I'm Dr [Name], I'm one of the emergency doctors who's been looking after Thomas. This is Sarah, one of our nurses. *[Gesture to chair]* Please, sit down. *[Sit down immediately yourself]*"

**[Delivering News - 30 sec]**
"Mrs Chen, I'm very sorry, but I have very sad news. *[Pause 2 seconds]*

We did everything we could to save Thomas's life, but I'm very sorry to tell you that he has died.

He died at 2:35 this afternoon.

*[SILENCE - 10-15 seconds - observe reaction]*"

**[Acute Grief Response - 60-90 sec]**
*[Wife wails: "NOOOOO! NO! NO! HE CAN'T BE DEAD!" - loud crying, may collapse]*
*[Hand tissues]*
*[Sit quietly - forward lean - present - DON'T SPEAK]*
*[Allow 60 seconds of intense wailing/crying without interrupting]*

*[After 60-90 seconds, when crying quiets slightly - softly]:*
"I'm so, so sorry."

*[More silence - 15-30 seconds - let patient cry]*

**[Confirmation - 30 sec]**
*[Patient asks through tears: "Are you sure? Can I see him?"]*
"Yes, I'm certain. I'm so sorry.

Yes, of course you can see him. I'll take you to him very soon. There's no rush - take all the time you need."

**[Explanation - When Patient Ready - 60 sec]**
*[Patient asks: "What happened? He was fine this morning!"]*
"From what the paramedics told us, Thomas collapsed suddenly at home while you were having lunch. You started CPR immediately - that was absolutely the right thing to do.

Paramedics continued CPR and brought him here. When he arrived, his heart was in a dangerous rhythm. We tried multiple shocks to restart his heart, medications, CPR - everything we could.

For a brief moment, we got his heart beating again, but we couldn't sustain it. After 45 minutes, it became clear we couldn't save him.

We believe he had a massive heart attack. This type of heart attack can happen very suddenly, without warning."

**[Addressing "Did He Suffer?" - 30 sec]**
*[If patient asks: "Did he suffer?"]*
"No. When the heart stops, you lose consciousness immediately within seconds. He wouldn't have felt pain. He wouldn't have known what was happening."

**[Addressing Guilt - 45 sec]**
*[Patient says: "Did I do the CPR wrong? Should I have done something different?"]*
"No, this was absolutely not your fault. You did everything right. You called 000 immediately and started CPR. You gave him the best possible chance.

Even when everything is done right - CPR immediately, paramedics quickly, everything we have in hospital - sometimes we can't save someone. This was not your fault."

**[Viewing Body - 60 sec]**
"Would you like to see Thomas now?"

*[Patient says yes]*

"I'll take you to him in just a moment. I want to prepare you: he'll be in the resuscitation bay. There will be some medical equipment around. We've covered him with a sheet. You can touch him, hold his hand, talk to him. You can spend as much time as you need with him.

Would you like to call anyone first - family or friends?"

**[Practical - 60 sec]**
"Because Thomas's death was sudden and unexpected, the Coroner needs to be involved. This is standard procedure. The Coroner may want to do a post-mortem to determine the exact cause. This may delay the funeral slightly - usually a few days to a week.

We'll collect Thomas's personal belongings for you - you don't need to worry about that right now.

Is there anyone we can call for you? You shouldn't be alone tonight. Is there someone who can stay with you?"

**[Before Taking to Body - 20 sec]**
"I'm going to take you to Thomas now. There's no rush. Take all the time you need with him. Sarah will stay with you.

Mrs Chen, I'm deeply sorry for your loss."

### MODEL ANSWER

**[Opening - 30 sec]**
"Hello Mr and Mrs Thompson. I'm Dr [Name], one of the paediatric doctors. Thank you for coming in. *[Sit]* I know waiting for results has been very stressful. Before we talk, I want to check - is there anyone else you'd like with you, or is it just the two of you?"

**[Perception - 45 sec]**
"I can see you're both very anxious. Before I go through Lily's results, can I ask what you've been thinking about? [Listen] What have you been worried the tests might show?"

**[Delivering News - 45 sec]**
"I'm afraid the results show something serious. *[Pause 2 seconds]*

Lily's bone marrow test shows that she has leukaemia. *[Pause - observe reaction]*"

**[CRITICAL - Addressing Death Fear - 90 sec]**
*[Within 10 seconds, Father asks desperately: "Is she going to die? Please tell us she's not going to die."]*

"**I understand that's your first fear, and I want to answer that directly: Childhood ALL is very treatable. Most children - about 85 to 90% - are CURED. This is serious, but there's real reason for hope.**

Let me say that again because it's important: 85 to 90 out of 100 children with exactly Lily's type of leukaemia never have the leukaemia come back. They're cured.

This is one of the success stories of paediatric medicine. 30 years ago, most children with leukaemia died. Now, most children are cured.

So yes, this is very serious. But no, we're expecting Lily to survive and be cured."

**[Empathy - 30 sec]**
*[Mother crying: "She's only 4 years old. This can't be happening."]*
"I know. This is every parent's worst nightmare. I'm so sorry this is happening to Lily and to your family. *[Pause, tissues]*"

**[Explaining Leukaemia - 60 sec]**
"Let me explain what leukaemia is. Leukaemia is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside bones that makes blood cells.

In leukaemia, the bone marrow makes abnormal blood cells that don't work properly. These abnormal cells crowd out the normal cells. That's why Lily's been tired - she doesn't have enough red blood cells. And why she's been bruising - she doesn't have enough platelets.

The specific type Lily has is called Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia - A-L-L for short. ALL is the most common type of leukaemia in children, and it's the most treatable."

**[Guilt - 45 sec]**
*[Mother: "Did we cause this? Is it genetic?"]*
"No. You absolutely did not cause this. There's nothing you did or didn't do that caused Lily's leukaemia.

Childhood leukaemia happens due to random genetic changes in blood cells. It's not hereditary - it's not passed down in families. It's not caused by anything in the environment or diet. It's not anything you did during pregnancy.

This is not your fault."

**[Treatment - 90 sec]**
*[Father: "What's the treatment?"]*
"Treatment is chemotherapy. I'll give you an overview, and then the oncologist - the cancer specialist - will go into detail.

Treatment happens in three phases:
1. Induction - intensive chemo for 1-2 months to get the leukaemia into remission
2. Consolidation - more chemo for 6-9 months
3. Maintenance - lower-dose chemo for 2-3 years

Total treatment is about 2 to 2.5 years.

Lily will need to be in hospital a lot, especially the first few months. Some treatment can be done as an outpatient. You can stay with her - we have parent beds in the rooms.

Chemotherapy has side effects - hair loss, nausea, increased infection risk. But we have good medications to manage these."

**[Next Steps - 60 sec]**
"Here's what happens immediately. Lily will be admitted to the paediatric oncology ward today. Tomorrow, she'll have a central line inserted - a special IV line - under anaesthetic. Then we'll start chemotherapy.

You'll meet the oncology team - they'll be Lily's main doctors. They'll explain everything in detail.

There are support services available: Redkite is an Australian charity that supports children with cancer - financial help, counselling. Social work can help with practical things. A psychologist can help Lily and you cope.

The good news is that all of Lily's treatment is fully covered by Medicare in Australia. You won't pay for chemotherapy or hospital stays."

**[Closing - 30 sec]**
"I know this is overwhelming and terrifying. Lily has leukaemia, which is serious. But childhood ALL is very treatable, with an 85-90% cure rate. Treatment is hard - the next 2-3 years will be challenging - but most children come through it and are cured.

Do you have any questions right now?"

### MODEL ANSWER

**[Opening - 30 sec]**
"Good afternoon Mrs Foster, Mr Foster. Thank you both for coming in. *[Sit]* Margaret, I have the results of your memory tests and brain scan. I wanted to discuss them with you and your husband together."

**[Perception - 60 sec]**
"*[To patient first]* Margaret, before we go through the results, can you tell me what you've noticed about your memory? [Listen]

*[To spouse]* And Mr Foster, what have you noticed? [Listen]"

**[Delivering Diagnosis - 60 sec]**
"*[To patient]* Margaret, the memory tests and brain scan show that you have dementia. *[Pause]*

Dementia is a medical condition where problems with memory and thinking affect your ability to do everyday activities. It's caused by changes in the brain. It's not normal ageing - it's a medical condition.

Based on the pattern of your symptoms and the brain scan, this is most likely Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's is the most common type of dementia.

*[To spouse]* Mr Foster, I know you've suspected this. *[He tears up]* I know this is difficult news, even when you've been expecting it."

**[Prognosis - 90 sec]**
"I need to be honest with you both about what to expect. Dementia is a progressive condition - that means it gets worse over time. Alzheimer's usually progresses slowly - over years, not months.

There are three stages: early, moderate, and advanced. Margaret, we think you're in the moderate stage now. Memory will get worse over time, and you'll need increasing help with daily activities.

*[To spouse, when he asks: "Will she forget who I am?"]*
That can happen in very advanced Alzheimer's, but usually not for a long time - many years. Right now, Margaret knows you well. We're going to focus on slowing progression and maintaining quality of life."

**[Treatment - 60 sec]**
"We can't cure Alzheimer's, but we have treatments that can slow it down. I'd recommend trying a medication called donepezil. It can slow progression for 6-12 months. It doesn't work for everyone, but it's worth trying. On the PBS, it's $31 per script, or $7 with a healthcare card.

Just as important: mental stimulation, physical exercise, staying social. Keep doing puzzles, reading, walking, seeing friends. Don't withdraw."

**[Driving - CRITICAL - 90 sec]**
"Margaret, we need to talk about driving. *[Pause]*

In Australia, when someone's diagnosed with dementia, there's a legal requirement to notify the licensing authority - Service NSW in our state. I'm required to notify them as well.

You'll need a driving assessment with an occupational therapist. This tests whether it's safe for you to drive. Some people with early dementia pass and can continue driving with regular checks. Others don't pass and need to stop.

*[Patient protests: "But I've been driving for 50 years!"]*
I understand driving is important to you. This isn't about how good a driver you've been - it's about safety now. Dementia affects reaction time and judgement. The assessment will determine if it's safe.

*[To spouse]* In the meantime, I'd recommend you do the driving when possible."

**[Support - 90 sec]**
"There are important support services available. I'm going to refer you to **My Aged Care** - their number is 1800 200 422. They'll do an assessment and organize a care package. This can include home help, personal care, meals, respite care.

**Dementia Australia** - 1800 100 500 - provides information, support groups, counselling.

Margaret, while you still have capacity - and you do now - it's important to complete legal documents: Power of Attorney so someone can manage your finances if needed, and an Advanced Care Directive about medical treatment wishes. See a solicitor soon about this."

**[Carer Burden - 60 sec]**
"*[To spouse]* Mr Foster, I want to talk to you specifically. You're going to be Margaret's main carer. This is one of the hardest jobs in the world.

You may feel grief, frustration, isolation, exhaustion. All of this is normal. **You must take breaks.** Use respite care. See your own GP for your own health. There's Carer Gateway - 1800 422 737 - for carer support.

You can't care for Margaret if you burn out."

**[Closing - 30 sec]**
"*[To both]* Margaret, you have Alzheimer's disease. This will progress over time, but we have treatments to slow it and support to help you both cope. Mr Foster, this will be hard on you too - please use the support services.

Do you have questions right now?"
