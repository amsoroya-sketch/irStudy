**Name**: Mr James Wilson
**Age**: 58 years old
**Occupation**: Office manager (sedentary job)

### YOUR SCENARIO

You are at the Emergency Department because you had chest pain about 2 hours ago while playing tennis. The pain was quite severe - you had to stop playing and sit down. It's mostly settled now but you still feel a bit of discomfort.

### HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT

**When asked about the pain, describe it as follows**:

**Site**:
- "It was in the middle of my chest" (point to centre of sternum)

**Onset**:
- "I was playing tennis with my mate - we'd been playing for about 30 minutes when it came on quite suddenly"

- Time: "About 2 hours ago, around 10am"

**Character**:
- "It felt like a heavy weight on my chest, like someone was sitting on it"
- "Tight, pressing feeling"
- NOT sharp, NOT burning

**Radiation**:
- "It spread to my left arm" (point to left upper arm)

### PAST MEDICAL HISTORY

- ☐ **CLEAR PASS** (≥70%): Confident, systematic, safe practice. Would pass in real AMC Clinical.

- ☐ **BORDERLINE PASS** (60-69%): Adequate performance with minor deficiencies. Needs polishing but demonstrates safe practice.

- ☐ **BORDERLINE FAIL** (50-59%): Significant deficiencies but not unsafe. Needs substantial improvement.

- ☐ **CLEAR FAIL** (<50%): Major deficiencies, disorganized, or unsafe practice. Not ready for AMC Clinical.

---

## CRITICAL ERRORS (Automatic Fail if Present)

**Tick if any of the following occurred**:

- ☐ **Safety Issue**: Missed life-threatening diagnosis (ACS) or suggested unsafe discharge
- ☐ **Gross Disorganization**: Unable to take coherent history
- ☐ **Unprofessional Behavior**: Rude, dismissive, or inappropriate
- ☐ **Time Management Failure**: Unable to provide any summary even when prompted

## ANSWER KEY (What Candidate Should Have Done)

### IDEAL APPROACH

**Opening (30 sec)**:
- Hand hygiene, introduction, consent
- "Hello Mr Wilson, I'm Dr [Name]. I understand you've come in with chest pain today. I'd like to ask you some questions about this. Is that alright?"

**SOCRATES History (3-4 min)**:
- Systematically cover all 8 components
- Identify red flags: Exertional, central, tight, radiating to arm/jaw, associated sweating + SOB

**Risk Factors (2 min)**:
- Past history: Angina, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia
- Medications: Aspirin, statin, antihypertensive, GTN
- Smoking: Ex-smoker (30 pack-years)
- Family history: Strong (father died MI at 63, brother had stent)

**Summary to Examiner (1 min)**:
"This is a 58-year-old man with exertional central chest pain, radiating to left arm and jaw, associated with sweating and shortness of breath, partially relieved by rest and GTN.

He has multiple cardiovascular risk factors including known angina, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, ex-smoker with 30 pack-year history, and strong family history of ischaemic heart disease.

**My top 3 differentials are**:
1. **Acute Coronary Syndrome** (unstable angina or NSTEMI) - most likely given exertional pain, cardiac risk factors, radiation pattern
2. **Progression of stable angina** - though concerning that pain lasted 15-20 min (longer than typical angina)
3. **Pulmonary embolism** - less likely as no risk factors for DVT/PE, but pleuritic component possible

**Immediate management**:
- Urgent ECG (within 10 minutes)
- Serial troponins (0 and 3 hours)
- Chest X-ray
- Bloods: FBC, UEC, CRP
- If troponin elevated: MONA (morphine if needed, oxygen if SpO2 <94%, nitrates, aspirin 300mg)
- Urgent cardiology consult
- Admit for observation

This patient should **not be discharged** from ED."
