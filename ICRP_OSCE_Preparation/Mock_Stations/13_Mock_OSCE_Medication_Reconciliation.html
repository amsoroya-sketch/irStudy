            <h3>Scenario</h3>
            <p>You are a GP registrar. Mr. Robert Chen, a 72-year-old man, was discharged from hospital yesterday after treatment for pneumonia. He has brought his discharge summary and all his medications to today's appointment and is confused about what to take.</p>

            <h3>Your Task (8 minutes)</h3>
            <p><strong>Perform medication reconciliation</strong> and educate the patient about his medications. You should:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Review discharge medications vs home medications</li>
                <li>Identify discrepancies and explain changes</li>
                <li>Ensure patient understands each medication (indication, dosing, side effects)</li>
                <li>Identify and address any medication safety concerns</li>
                <li>Provide clear instructions and check understanding</li>

            <div class="tip">
                <strong>💡 Australian Context:</strong> Use "teach-back" method to confirm understanding. Provide written medication list. Ensure patient knows which medications to STOP and which to CONTINUE.

                </tr>
            </table>

            <h3>Step 2: Patient Education (Using Teach-Back Method)</h3>

            <p><strong>For Each Medication, Explain:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Name:</strong> "This is called..."</li>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> "It's for..."</li>
                <li><strong>Dose & Timing:</strong> "Take X at Y time"</li>
                <li><strong>Important warnings:</strong> "Don't take with... Watch for..."</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Then CHECK UNDERSTANDING:</strong> "Can you tell me back which tablets you'll take in the morning?"</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Medication Safety Points</h3>

            <h4>Key Safety Messages:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>🚨 <strong>"Your 4 regular medications - aspirin, atorvastatin, metoprolol, omeprazole - CONTINUE these every day. Don't stop."</strong></li>
                <li>🚨 <strong>"The antibiotic (amoxicillin) - finish the full course. You have 2 more days."</strong></li>
                <li>🚨 <strong>"The steroid (prednisolone) - you have 3 more days, then STOP. Don't continue after that."</strong></li>
                <li><strong>"The steroid may make you feel jittery and affect your sleep - this is normal and will stop when you finish the course."</strong></li>
                <li><strong>"If you get a rash, severe diarrhea, or feel unwell while on the antibiotic - stop it and call us."</strong></li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Step 4: Provide Written Plan & Aids</h3>

            <p><strong>Give patient:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>✅ <strong>Written medication list</strong> (typed, clear, with purpose of each medication)</li>
                <li>✅ <strong>Dosette box (Webster pack)</strong> - arrange pharmacy to prepare weekly blister pack</li>
                <li>✅ <strong>Calendar marked with finish dates</strong> for antibiotics and steroids</li>
                <li>✅ <strong>Contact number</strong> if questions arise</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 5: Safety Netting</h3>

            <p><strong>"If you experience any of these, contact us immediately:"</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Severe rash or allergic reaction</li>
                <li>Difficulty breathing</li>
                <li>Severe diarrhea (>6 times/day)</li>
                <li>Confusion or dizziness</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 6: Follow-up</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Review in 1 week</strong> (after finishing antibiotic and steroid courses)</li>
                <li><strong>Check chest X-ray</strong> in 6 weeks to ensure pneumonia resolved</li>
                <li><strong>Annual medication review</strong> for elderly patients on polypharmacy</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Australian Best Practice - Medication Reconciliation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use National Residential Medication Chart (NRMC) format</li>
                <li>Include generic AND brand names</li>
                <li>Specify indication for each medication</li>
                <li>Arrange Webster packing for compliance</li>
                <li>Engage community pharmacist for ongoing support</li>
                <li>Use MedChart app or similar for patient medication records</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section img-mistakes">
            <h2>⚠️ IMG Common Mistakes</h2>

            <h3>❌ MISTAKE #1: Not Clarifying Which Medications to STOP vs CONTINUE</h3>
            <p><strong>Why this fails:</strong> Patients assume new medications REPLACE old ones. If you don't explicitly say "Continue your regular medications AND add these new ones," patient may stop regular medications.</p>
            <p><strong>✅ CORRECT:</strong> "Your 4 regular tablets - keep taking those. The hospital has ADDED 2 new medications for the infection - these are temporary."</p>

            <h3>❌ MISTAKE #2: Using Medical Jargon</h3>
            <p><strong>Why this fails:</strong> Saying "Take your beta-blocker and PPI" means nothing to patients. Use simple language.</p>
            <p><strong>✅ CORRECT:</strong> "Take your blood pressure tablet (metoprolol) and your stomach tablet (omeprazole)."</p>

            <h3>❌ MISTAKE #3: Not Using Teach-Back Method</h3>
            <p><strong>Why this fails:</strong> Explaining is not enough - you must CHECK the patient understands.</p>
            <p><strong>✅ CORRECT:</strong> After explaining, ask "Can you tell me which tablets you'll take in the morning?" or "Can you show me which ones you'll stop after 3 days?"</p>

            <h3>❌ MISTAKE #4: Not Providing Written Instructions</h3>
            <p><strong>Why this fails:</strong> Verbal instructions alone are forgotten. 50% of information is forgotten within minutes.</p>
            <p><strong>✅ CORRECT:</strong> Always provide WRITTEN medication list with names, doses, times, and purposes.</p>

            <h3>❌ MISTAKE #5: Not Addressing Patient's Concerns</h3>
            <p><strong>Why this fails:</strong> Patient expressed worry about "mixing up tablets." If you don't address this, patient remains anxious.</p>
            <p><strong>✅ CORRECT:</strong> "I understand you're worried about mixing them up. Let's organize a Webster pack from the pharmacy - all your tablets pre-packed for each day."</p>

            <h3>Summary - Critical "Must Do" Items:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>✅ Review BOTH home medications AND discharge medications</li>
                <li>✅ Explicitly state which to CONTINUE vs which to STOP</li>
                <li>✅ Explain PURPOSE of each medication in simple language</li>
                <li>✅ Use TEACH-BACK method to check understanding</li>
                <li>✅ Provide WRITTEN medication list</li>
                <li>✅ Arrange compliance aid (Webster pack)</li>
                <li>✅ Address patient's specific concerns</li>
                <li>✅ Safety net - when to seek help</li>
                <li>✅ Arrange follow-up</li>
