            <h4>📝 Model Summary to Examiner</h4>
            <p>"This is an 82-year-old woman who has developed acute confusion following admission for urinary tract infection.</p>

            <p><strong>Key findings suggesting DELIRIUM:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Acute onset:</strong> Confusion started 24 hours ago (not gradual)</li>
                <li><strong>Normal baseline cognition:</strong> Previously independent, sharp, no dementia</li>
                <li><strong>Fluctuating course:</strong> Worse at night (sundowning), drowsy during day</li>
                <li><strong>Inattention:</strong> Disorientated to place and time</li>
                <li><strong>Perceptual disturbances:</strong> Visual hallucinations (seeing flies)</li>
                <li><strong>Altered consciousness:</strong> Hyperactive type (agitated, wandering)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Precipitating factors identified:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Infection (UTI) - most common cause in elderly</li>
                <li>Unfamiliar environment (hospital admission)</li>
                <li>Sleep deprivation (poor sleep week before + disrupted in hospital)</li>
                <li>Possible sedative medication (given for agitation)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Against dementia:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Acute onset (dementia is insidious over months-years)</li>
                <li>Previously normal cognition 3 days ago</li>
                <li>Fluctuating course (dementia is progressive, not fluctuating)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>My diagnosis: Hyperactive delirium secondary to UTI</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Investigations needed:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Urine M/C/S (likely already sent)</li>
                <li>FBC (infection markers)</li>
                <li>UEC (renal function, dehydration)</li>
                <li>LFTs</li>
                <li>Glucose (hypoglycaemia can cause confusion)</li>
                <li>Calcium (hypercalcaemia)</li>
                <li>TSH (thyroid)</li>
                <li>Medication review (check for deliriogenic drugs)</li>
                <li>Consider CT head if focal neurology or fall</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Management plan:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Treat underlying cause:</strong> Continue antibiotics for UTI</li>
                <li><strong>Review medications:</strong> STOP benzodiazepines/sedatives if given</li>
                <li><strong>Non-pharmacological management (first-line):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reorientation strategies (clock, calendar visible)</li>
                        <li>Familiar objects from home (photos)</li>
                        <li>Encourage family visits for reassurance</li>
                        <li>Ensure glasses/hearing aids in place</li>
                        <li>Avoid restraints</li>
                        <li>Regular toileting, mobilisation</li>
                        <li>Sleep hygiene (reduce noise at night)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Pharmacological (last resort only if severe agitation/harm risk):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Low-dose haloperidol 0.5-1mg (avoid benzodiazepines)</li>
                        <li>Or risperidone 0.25-0.5mg</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Prognosis & counselling for daughter:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>"This is delirium, not dementia or Alzheimer's"</li>
                <li>"Delirium is usually reversible once we treat the infection"</li>
                <li>"It may take days to weeks to fully resolve in elderly patients"</li>
                <li>"She's likely to return to her baseline cognitive function"</li>
                <li>"However, delirium does increase risk of future dementia, so we'll arrange follow-up cognitive assessment in 3 months"</li>
                <li>"For now, we need your help with reorientation - bring in family photos, talk to her about familiar topics"</li>

        <h2 id="img-mistakes">⚠️ IMG COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID</h2>

        <div class="alert alert-yellow">
            <h4>🚨 Critical Errors That Lead to Failure</h4>

            <h4>1. NOT ESTABLISHING BASELINE COGNITION</h4>
            <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Jumping straight to "What's happening now?" without asking about usual mental state</p>
            <p><strong>Why this fails:</strong> Cannot distinguish delirium from dementia without knowing baseline</p>
            <p><strong>MUST ASK:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Before this hospital admission, what was your mother's memory like?"</li>
                <li>"Could she manage her own medications? Pay her bills? Do her shopping?"</li>
                <li>"Did she have any diagnosis of dementia or memory problems?"</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>This patient:</strong> Normal baseline = delirium (not dementia)</p>

            <h4>2. CONFUSING DELIRIUM WITH DEMENTIA</h4>
            <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Elderly + confused = dementia</p>
            <p><strong>Why this fails:</strong> Delirium is REVERSIBLE, dementia is PROGRESSIVE</p>

            <p><strong>Key Differences (Australian eTG teaching):</strong></p>

                </tr>
            </table>

            <h4>3. MISSING THE "CAM" CRITERIA FOR DELIRIUM</h4>
            <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Not using structured approach</p>
            <p><strong>Australian OSCEs expect CAM (Confusion Assessment Method):</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Acute onset + fluctuating course</strong> ✅ This patient (24 hours, worse at night)</li>
                <li><strong>Inattention</strong> ✅ This patient (disorientated, can't focus)</li>
                <li><strong>Disorganized thinking OR</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Altered level of consciousness</strong> ✅ This patient (hyper active, agitated)</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Delirium diagnosis:</strong> Need #1 + #2 + (#3 OR #4)</p>

            <h4>4. NOT ASKING ABOUT "SUNDOWNING"</h4>
            <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Not asking "Is she worse at a particular time of day?"</p>
            <p><strong>Why this fails:</strong> Sundowning (worsening at night) is PATHOGNOMONIC for delirium</p>
            <p><strong>Must ask:</strong> "Is the confusion worse during the day or at night?"</p>
            <p><strong>This patient:</strong> Agitated at night, drowsy during day = CLASSIC sundowning</p>

            <h4>5. FORGETTING TO ASK ABOUT MEDICATIONS</h4>
            <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Not asking "Have any new medications been started in hospital?"</p>
            <p><strong>Why this fails:</strong> Medications are the #2 most common cause of delirium (after infection)</p>

            <p><strong>Deliriogenic drugs (Australian eTG):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Benzodiazepines</strong> - #1 culprit (temazepam, diazepam) ⚠️ This patient got "something to sleep"</li>
                <li>Anticholinergics (oxybutynin, hyoscine)</li>
                <li>Opioids (morphine, oxycodone)</li>
                <li>Antihistamines (promethazine)</li>
                <li>Corticosteroids</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Australian nursing practice:</strong> Often give "PRN temazepam" for agitation → WORSENS delirium!</p>

            <h4>6. WRONG INITIAL MANAGEMENT</h4>
            <p><strong>Mistake #1:</strong> "I would start her on haloperidol"</p>
            <p><strong>Why this fails:</strong> Non-pharmacological first! Drugs are LAST resort</p>

            <p><strong>Correct approach (Australian Delirium Guidelines 2024):</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>FIRST:</strong> Treat underlying cause (UTI antibiotics)</li>
                <li><strong>SECOND:</strong> Non-pharmacological (reorientation, familiar objects, family presence)</li>
                <li><strong>THIRD:</strong> Review medications (STOP benzodiazepines)</li>
                <li><strong>LAST RESORT:</strong> Antipsychotics (only if severe agitation risking harm)</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Mistake #2:</strong> "Continue the sleeping tablet"</p>
            <p><strong>Why this fails:</strong> Benzodiazepines CAUSE delirium - must STOP them</p>

            <h4>7. NOT REASSURING THE DAUGHTER</h4>
            <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Giving medical information without addressing emotional concerns</p>
            <p><strong>Why this fails:</strong> Daughter is terrified this is "the beginning of the end"</p>

            <p><strong>Must explicitly say:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>"This is NOT dementia or Alzheimer's"</li>
                <li>"This is delirium, which is usually reversible"</li>
                <li>"Your mum is likely to return to her normal self once we treat the infection"</li>
                <li>"It may take a few days or weeks, but we expect good recovery"</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Australian cultural expectation:</strong> Families are VERY involved in care - reassure and include them</p>

            <h4>8. MISSING THE "PINCH" MNEMONIC</h4>
            <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Not systematically ruling out other causes</p>

            <p><strong>Australian teaching - PINCH ME causes of delirium:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>P</strong> - Pain ✅ Ask about</li>
                <li><strong>I</strong> - Infection ✅ This patient (UTI)</li>
                <li><strong>N</strong> - Nutrition/Hydration ✅ Check</li>
                <li><strong>C</strong> - Constipation ✅ Ask about</li>
                <li><strong>H</strong> - Hypoxia ✅ Check sats</li>
                <li><strong>M</strong> - Medications ✅ This patient (benzodiazepine)</li>
                <li><strong>E</strong> - Environment change ✅ This patient (hospital admission)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>9. POOR COLLATERAL HISTORY TECHNIQUE</h4>
            <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Talking to relative like they're the patient</p>

            <p><strong>Correct approach:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Thank you for coming in. I'd like to ask you some questions about your mother to help me understand what's been happening"</li>
                <li>Use third person: "How is <strong>she</strong> normally?" not "How are <strong>you</strong>?"</li>
                <li>Get daughter's perspective: "What have <strong>you</strong> noticed?" "What are <strong>you</strong> most worried about?"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>10. NOT DISCUSSING PROGNOSIS</h4>
            <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Making diagnosis but not explaining what happens next</p>

            <p><strong>Australian OSCE expects prognostic counselling:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Most cases of delirium resolve within 1-2 weeks"</li>
                <li>"However, in elderly patients, full recovery can take up to 3 months"</li>
                <li>"About 10-20% may have persistent cognitive changes"</li>
                <li>"Delirium does slightly increase future dementia risk, so we'll arrange follow-up cognitive testing in 3 months"</li>
                <li>"For now, your mum will likely be able to return home once the infection clears and confusion improves"</li>
            </ul>
