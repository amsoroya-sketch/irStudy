## HOW TO USE THESE MOCK STATIONS

### For Self-Practice:
1. Read candidate instructions only (don't read actor script or examiner checklist)
2. Set 8-minute timer
3. Practice aloud (ideally record yourself)
4. After 8 minutes, review examiner checklist - mark yourself honestly
5. Watch recording (if made) - assess body language, silence tolerance, empathy

### For Peer Practice:
1. **Candidate**: Reads candidate instructions only
2. **Actor**: Reads actor script, follows emotional cues
3. **Examiner** (optional 3rd person): Uses checklist to mark in real-time
4. Run 8-minute station
5. Feedback session:
   - Actor feedback: "I felt...", "It would have helped if..."
   - Examiner feedback: Checklist scores + observations
   - Candidate reflection: "I struggled with...", "I did well on..."
6. Rotate roles

### SIMULATED PATIENT SCRIPT

**Name**: James Mitchell
**Age**: 32
**Occupation**: Graphic designer
**Background**:
- Has been feeling unwell for 3 months
- Recurrent oral thrush that won't clear
- Lost 6kg without trying
- Night sweats
- Had unprotected sex with casual partners over past year
- Worried but hoped it was "just stress"
- No medical background in family
- Currently single

**Opening Demeanor**: Nervous, fidgeting

**Emotional Trajectory**:

**When diagnosis delivered**:
- Go silent for 10 seconds, stare at doctor
- Then quietly say: "Are you sure?"
- After doctor confirms, start crying quietly

**After initial crying** (30-60 seconds in):
- "Am I going to die? I thought HIV was a death sentence."
- *This is your key fear - you think you're going to die soon*

**If doctor explains treatment well**:
- Some relief visible
- "So this is manageable? Like diabetes or something?"

**Key Concerns to Raise** (if doctor doesn't address):
1. "Am I going to die?" → Want reassurance about lifespan
2. "Did I give this to anyone?" → Guilt about past partners
3. "Do I have to tell people?" → Fear of stigma, privacy concerns
4. "Will I be on medication forever?" → Want to understand treatment duration

**If candidate does well**:
- Engage with questions
- Show some relief when treatment explained
- Thank doctor

**If candidate does poorly** (rushes, lacks empathy):
- Become more withdrawn
- Stop asking questions
- Look distressed but shut down

**Cues to Give**:
- [Early] *Fidgeting with hands*: "I've been really worried about this test."
- [After diagnosis] *Crying*: "This can't be happening."
- [Mid-station] *Anxiously*: "Who do I have to tell? Do I have to tell my family?"
- [Late] *Cautiously hopeful*: "So people actually live normal lives with this now?"

### MODEL ANSWER - HIGH-SCORING APPROACH

**Time Breakdown**:
- Opening & Perception: 90 seconds
- Delivering news & emotional response: 120 seconds
- Explaining HIV & treatment: 120 seconds
- Next steps & closing: 90 seconds
- **Total: 7-8 minutes**

**Opening** (30 sec):
"Hello James, I'm Dr [Name]. Thank you for coming in. *[Sit down]* I've received the results of your HIV test, and I wanted to discuss them with you. Is there anyone you'd like to have with you for this conversation, or are you okay to talk alone?"

**Perception** (60 sec):
"Before I go through the results, can I ask what you've been thinking about since we did the test? [Listen] What do you understand about why we did the HIV test? [Listen] What were you hoping it would show? [Listen]"

**Delivering News** (30 sec):
"I'm afraid I have some difficult news to share with you. *[Pause 2 seconds]* Your HIV test has come back positive. *[Pause 5-10 seconds - observe reaction]*"

**Emotional Response** (60 sec):
*[Patient goes silent, then cries quietly]*
*[Hand tissues, lean forward, allow 15-20 seconds of silence]*
"I can see this is very difficult news for you. I'm sorry to have to tell you this. Take your time."
*[Patient asks: "Am I going to die?"]*
"I understand that's your first fear, and that's completely understandable. I want to tell you something very important: with modern treatment, people with HIV live normal lifespans. This is not a death sentence. HIV is now a manageable chronic condition, like diabetes."

**Explaining HIV** (90 sec):
"Let me explain what HIV is. HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. It's a virus that affects your immune system - the part of your body that fights infections. That's why you've been having the oral thrush - your immune system has been weakened. [Pause]

Now, HIV and AIDS are not the same thing - this is important. HIV is the virus. AIDS is the advanced stage that happens if HIV isn't treated. With treatment, you will never develop AIDS. [Pause] Do you understand the difference?"

**Treatment** (90 sec):
"The good news - and there is good news - is that we have excellent treatments for HIV. Treatment is called antiretroviral therapy. It's usually one pill once a day. This medication stops the virus from multiplying in your body.

The goal is to get your virus level down to undetectable. When you're undetectable, you can't pass HIV to others, even through sex. This is called U=U: Undetectable equals Untransmittable.

All HIV medications in Australia are on the PBS - the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme - so they're very affordable. About $31 per script, or $7 with a healthcare card. So treatment is accessible here.

What questions do you have about treatment?"

**Addressing Concerns** (variable):
*[If patient asks about telling people]*:
"You don't have to tell everyone - this is your private medical information. However, you do have a legal and ethical obligation to tell any sexual partners. We have a partner notification service that can help - they can notify partners anonymously if you prefer."

**Next Steps** (60 sec):
"Here's what happens next. I'm going to refer you to an infectious diseases specialist. They'll usually see you within 1-2 weeks. They'll do some additional blood tests and start you on treatment. Within 3-6 months, your viral load should be undetectable.

I'm also going to give you information about support services. In NSW, there's ACON - they provide counselling, support groups, and information for people with HIV. Positive Life NSW is another great organization. I can also refer you to a counsellor if that would help.

I'd like to see you again in a few days to check how you're doing and answer any questions that come up. Here's my number if you need to talk before then.

Does that all make sense? What questions do you have?"

**Closing** (30 sec):
"Just to recap: You have HIV. This is serious, but it's very treatable. With medication, you'll live a normal life and won't be able to transmit the virus. We're referring you to a specialist, and there are support services available. I'll see you in a few days.

I'm sorry to have given you this difficult news, but I want you to know there's real hope. How are you feeling right now? Are you safe to drive home?"

**Key Differences Between 90% and 70% Performance**:

**90% candidate**:
- Comfortable with silence (counts to 10)
- Empathy statements feel genuine, not scripted
- Addresses "Am I going to die?" proactively and compassionately
- Explains U=U concept clearly
- Mentions PBS coverage
- Checks understanding frequently
- Body language shows comfort with difficult conversation

**70% candidate**:
- Allows some silence but rushes slightly
- Uses empathy statements but they feel more formulaic
- Addresses death fear when asked but not as reassuringly
- Explains treatment but misses U=U or PBS
- Checks understanding once or twice
- Body language shows some discomfort

### MODEL ANSWER

**[Opening - 30 sec]**
"Hello Emma, I'm Dr [Name]. Thank you for coming in. I know you went to the ED yesterday with bleeding. Please, sit down. Is your husband with you, or would you like him to join us?"

**[Perception - 45 sec]**
"Before we discuss the results, can you tell me what the doctors at the ED said to you? [Listen] What have you been thinking might be happening?"

**[Delivering News - 30 sec]**
"Emma, I'm very sorry, but I have sad news. *[Pause]* The ultrasound and blood tests confirm that you've had a miscarriage. The pregnancy has ended. *[Pause - observe, wait]*"

**[Emotional Response - 60 sec]**
*[Patient cries - hand tissues immediately]*
*[Silence 20-30 seconds - lean forward, stay present]*
"I'm so sorry, Emma. This is heartbreaking news. Take your time."

**[Addressing Guilt - CRITICAL - 90 sec]**
*[Patient asks through tears: "Did I cause this? I lifted heavy boxes..."]*
"Emma, I want to tell you something very important: **This is not your fault. You did not cause this. Lifting boxes did not cause your miscarriage.**

Nothing you did or didn't do caused this. You didn't cause it by working, exercising, lifting things, or anything else. Miscarriage is very common - about 1 in 4 to 1 in 5 pregnancies end in miscarriage. Most of the time, it's due to a random chromosomal abnormality in the embryo - something that was never compatible with life. This was going to happen regardless of what you did.

You did nothing wrong. Do you understand that?"

**[Physical Recovery - 45 sec]**
"Physically, your bleeding should settle over the next week or so. The ultrasound shows you've had a complete miscarriage, which means the pregnancy tissue has passed. You won't need medication or surgery.

If you develop very heavy bleeding - soaking two pads an hour for two hours - or fever, or severe pain, please go to ED. Otherwise, your body will recover naturally."

**[Future Pregnancy - 60 sec]**
*[Patient asks: "Can I have children? Will this happen again?"]*
"Having one miscarriage doesn't mean you'll have another. About 85% of women who've had one miscarriage go on to have successful next pregnancies. Most miscarriages are one-off events.

When you're ready to try again - and only when you're ready emotionally - medically, you can try after you've had one normal period. That's mainly so we can date the next pregnancy.

We don't usually do investigations unless someone's had three miscarriages in a row. After one miscarriage, the chances of it happening again are low."

**[Support - 60 sec]**
"How are you coping emotionally? Do you have support at home - your husband, family, friends? [Listen]

I can refer you to a counsellor who specializes in pregnancy loss if that would help. There's also an organization called SANDS - Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Support - their number is 1300 072 637. They support people after miscarriage. They have online forums and support groups.

Your husband is grieving too. Partners often grieve differently, but he's lost this pregnancy too. It's okay to talk about it together, or for him to seek support as well.

If you need time off work, I can write you a medical certificate - you don't have to tell your employer the reason."

**[Closing - 30 sec]**
"I'm very sorry for your loss, Emma. This is a real loss, and it's okay to grieve. I'd like to see you again in 2 weeks to make sure you've recovered physically and check how you're coping emotionally. Please call if you need anything before then. Do you have any questions for me right now?"
