        <div class="section candidate-instructions">
            <h2>📋 Candidate Instructions</h2>

            <h3>Scenario</h3>
            <p>You are a GP registrar working at Young Medical Centre. Your next patient is Ms. Jennifer Watson, a 48-year-old woman who has made an appointment for "heavy periods."</p>

            <h3>Your Task (8 minutes)</h3>
            <p><strong>Take a focused gynaecological history</strong> to identify the cause of her heavy bleeding and assess the impact on her life. You do NOT need to examine the patient.</p>

            <h3>You Should Cover:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Detailed menstrual history (quantify bleeding severity)</li>
                <li>Associated symptoms (pain, pressure symptoms)</li>
                <li>Impact on quality of life (anaemia symptoms, lifestyle disruption)</li>
                <li>🚨 Red flags for malignancy (age >45, intermenstrual/postcoital bleeding)</li>
                <li>Risk factors for structural pathology (fibroids, polyps)</li>
                <li>Contraception and future fertility wishes</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="warning">
                <strong>⏰ Time Warning:</strong> The examiner will give you a 1-minute warning at the 7-minute mark to allow you to summarize your findings and outline your investigation/management plan.
            </div>

            <div class="warning">
                <strong>🚨 CRITICAL:</strong> Women aged >45 years with abnormal uterine bleeding MUST have endometrial sampling (pipelle biopsy or hysteroscopy) to exclude endometrial cancer. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE in Australian practice (RANZCOG 2024).
            </div>

            <div class="tip">
                <strong>💡 Australian Context:</strong> Heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) affects 20-30% of women of reproductive age. It's the most common reason for gynaecological referral in Australia. Examiners expect systematic assessment using FIGO classification, quantification of bleeding severity, and appropriate investigation based on age and risk factors.

            <h2>👤 Simulated Patient Script</h2>

            <h3>Patient Background</h3>
            <p><strong>Name:</strong> Jennifer Watson</p>
            <p><strong>Age:</strong> 48 years old</p>
            <p><strong>Occupation:</strong> High school teacher</p>
            <p><strong>Presentation:</strong> Heavy menstrual bleeding for 18 months, getting progressively worse</p>

            <h3>Clinical Scenario</h3>
            <p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Heavy menstrual bleeding secondary to multiple uterine fibroids (leiomyomas), with secondary iron-deficiency anaemia</p>
            <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Very heavy periods (flooding, large clots), periods lasting 8-9 days, increasing frequency, fatigue, pelvic pressure</p>
            <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Affecting work (missed days due to bleeding), social life restricted during periods, anxiety about bleeding through clothes</p>

            <h3>Opening Statement</h3>
            <p><em>(Patient looks tired, slightly pale)</em></p>
            <p><strong>"I'm here about my periods - they've become really heavy over the past year and a half. It's got to the point where I'm having to change super tampons every hour or two on my heavy days. I'm flooding through onto my clothes, passing huge clots, and I just feel exhausted all the time. I'm worried something's seriously wrong."</strong></p>

            <h3>Menstrual History - DETAILED</h3>

            <h4>Current Bleeding Pattern:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>How often do your periods come?</strong> "Every 24 days now - they used to be every 28 days like clockwork, but they're coming more frequently" (cycle length shortening - common with fibroids)</li>
                <li><strong>How long do they last?</strong> "8 to 9 days - they used to be 5 days" (prolonged bleeding)</li>
                <li><strong>Are they regular or irregular?</strong> "They're still pretty regular, just more frequent and heavier"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Bleeding Severity - CRITICAL TO QUANTIFY:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>How heavy is the bleeding?</strong> "Very heavy - especially days 2 and 3. I'm changing super tampons every 1-2 hours during the day. At night I use overnight pads AND towels on my bed because I'm flooding through" 🚨</li>
                <li><strong>Do you pass clots?</strong> "Yes, huge clots - some the size of golf balls. It's quite frightening actually" 🚨 (clots >2cm = abnormal)</li>
                <li><strong>How many pads/tampons per day?</strong> "On my heavy days, easily 10-12 super tampons, plus overnight pads. I've had to start wearing both tampons and pads together during the day at work" (>8 products/day = severe menorrhagia)</li>
                <li><strong>Do you ever flood through your clothes?</strong> "Yes, several times. I've had to leave work early twice in the past 3 months because I bled through my skirt. It's so embarrassing" (flooding = severe menorrhagia)</li>
                <li><strong>Any bleeding between periods?</strong> "No, nothing between periods" (no intermenstrual bleeding - less concerning for malignancy)</li>
                <li><strong>Any bleeding after sex?</strong> "No" (no postcoital bleeding - less concerning for cervical/endometrial pathology)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>When Did This Start & Progression:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>How long have your periods been heavy?</strong> "About 18 months. They started getting heavier gradually, but the last 6 months they've been really bad"</li>
                <li><strong>Were they normal before?</strong> "Yes, completely normal - regular 28-day cycle, 5 days, moderate flow. No problems at all until about 18 months ago"</li>
                <li><strong>Getting better or worse?</strong> "Definitely worse - each period seems heavier than the last" 🚨 (progressive worsening)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Associated Symptoms</h3>

            <h4>Pain:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Do you get period pain?</strong> "Yes, quite bad cramping on the first 2 days. I have to take ibuprofen and paracetamol together. It's worse than it used to be"</li>
                <li><strong>Any pain at other times (not during period)?</strong> "No, just during my period"</li>
                <li><strong>Pain during sex?</strong> "No"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Pressure Symptoms (Fibroid-Related):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Any bloating or feeling of pressure in your pelvis?</strong> "Actually yes - I've noticed my lower abdomen feels full and heavy, especially before my period. My jeans feel tighter around my lower tummy" 🚨 (pelvic pressure/bulk symptoms suggest fibroids)</li>
                <li><strong>Any urinary symptoms?</strong> "I've been needing to pass urine more frequently - maybe every 2 hours during the day. I thought maybe it's just getting older" (urinary frequency from fibroid pressure on bladder)</li>
                <li><strong>Any constipation or bowel problems?</strong> "Not really, no"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Symptoms of Anaemia - IMPORTANT:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>How's your energy level?</strong> "I'm exhausted all the time. I used to be really active - I'd go for a run after work - but now I just come home and collapse on the couch. I don't have energy for anything" 🚨</li>
                <li><strong>Do you feel short of breath?</strong> "Yes, especially if I climb stairs or walk uphill. I get puffed quite easily now" 🚨</li>
                <li><strong>Any dizziness?</strong> "Sometimes, especially if I stand up quickly" 🚨</li>
                <li><strong>Do you look pale?</strong> "People have commented that I look pale. My mum said I look 'washed out'" 🚨</li>
                <li><strong>Any chest pain or palpitations?</strong> "Sometimes I notice my heart racing when I walk upstairs"</li>
            </ul>

            <p><em>(These symptoms strongly suggest iron-deficiency anaemia from chronic blood loss)</em></p>

            <h3>Impact on Quality of Life - CRITICAL TO ASSESS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>How is this affecting your daily life?</strong> "It's really impacting everything. I'm a high school teacher and I've had to take sick days because I can't risk being in front of a class when I might flood. I'm anxious about going out during my period. I've stopped going to the gym, stopped seeing friends as much. It's really getting me down"</li>
                <li><strong>Impact on work?</strong> "I've had to take 2 days off work each period for the past 3 months. I'm worried about my sick leave running out. I can't concentrate when I'm worried about bleeding through"</li>
                <li><strong>Impact on social life/relationships?</strong> "I've cancelled dinners, avoided travel. My partner is understanding but our sex life has suffered - I just feel too tired and too worried about the bleeding"</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional impact?</strong> "I'm feeling quite down about it. I used to be confident and active, now I feel like I'm constantly worrying about my periods"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Obstetric History</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gravida/Para:</strong> "I've had 2 children - both vaginal deliveries, no complications. My youngest is 16 now" (G2P2)</li>
                <li><strong>Any future pregnancy plans?</strong> "No, definitely not. My family is complete - I'm 48, my kids are teenagers"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Contraception & Sexual History</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contraception?</strong> "My husband had a vasectomy 10 years ago, so we don't need contraception"</li>
                <li><strong>Sexually active?</strong> "Yes, with my husband"</li>
                <li><strong>Any STI history?</strong> "No, never"</li>
                <li><strong>Last cervical screening test (CST)?</strong> "About 18 months ago - it was normal" (up to date with screening)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Past Gynaecological History</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Any previous gynaecological problems?</strong> "No, periods have always been fine until now"</li>
                <li><strong>Any previous surgery?</strong> "Just two caesarean... no wait, sorry, I had vaginal births. No surgery except wisdom teeth"</li>
                <li><strong>Any family history of fibroids or heavy bleeding?</strong> "Actually yes - my mother had fibroids and had a hysterectomy when she was 50" 🚨 (family history increases fibroid risk)</li>
                <li><strong>Any family history of bleeding disorders?</strong> "Not that I know of"</li>
                <li><strong>Any family history of gynaecological cancers?</strong> "No"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Past Medical History</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Any medical problems?</strong> "I have hypothyroidism - I take thyroxine 100 micrograms daily. That's been stable for years"</li>
                <li><strong>Any bleeding disorders?</strong> "No"</li>
                <li><strong>Easy bruising or bleeding?</strong> "No, I don't bruise easily, cuts stop bleeding normally"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Medications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Current medications?</strong> "Just thyroxine 100mcg daily for my thyroid. And I've been taking iron tablets that I bought from the pharmacy - ferrograd C - because I thought I might be anaemic"</li>
                <li><strong>Have you tried anything for the heavy bleeding?</strong> "I've tried taking ibuprofen during my period - someone said it might help reduce the bleeding. It helps with the pain but the bleeding is still really heavy"</li>
                <li><strong>Allergies?</strong> "No known allergies"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Social History</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Occupation?</strong> "High school teacher - I teach English"</li>
                <li><strong>Living situation?</strong> "I live with my husband and our two teenage children"</li>
                <li><strong>Smoking?</strong> "No, never smoked"</li>
                <li><strong>Alcohol?</strong> "Socially - a couple of glasses of wine on weekends"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Menopausal Status</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Any hot flushes, night sweats, mood changes?</strong> "Yes, actually - I've been getting occasional hot flushes over the past year. Maybe once or twice a week. I thought it might be the start of menopause"</li>
                <li><strong>When did you first start your periods?</strong> "Age 12"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Patient Concerns (ICE)</h3>

            <h4>If Asked "What do you think is causing this?"</h4>
            <p>"I've been googling and I'm worried about cancer. I know I'm getting to that age. But I also read about fibroids - my mum had those and had to have a hysterectomy. I'm hoping it's something treatable and not cancer."</p>

            <h4>If Asked "What are you most worried about?"</h4>
            <p>"Honestly, I'm worried about two things - one, that it might be cancer. And two, that I'll need a hysterectomy. I know I don't want more children, but the thought of having my womb removed is quite scary. Will I go into early menopause? Will I feel different?"</p>

            <h4>If Asked "What were you hoping we could do?"</h4>
            <p>"I want to know what's causing it and what my options are. If there's a treatment that doesn't involve major surgery, I'd prefer that. But mainly I just want my life back - I can't go on like this. It's affecting my work, my relationships, everything."</p>

            <h3>Emotional State</h3>
            <p>Patient appears tired and looks slightly pale. She's articulate and well-prepared (has been researching her symptoms). She's worried but cooperative. Becomes tearful when discussing impact on her quality of life. Clearly motivated to find a solution.</p>

        <div class="section examiner-instructions">
            <h2>🎓 Examiner Instructions</h2>

            <h3>Your Role</h3>
            <p>You are observing a history-taking station for heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia). The candidate should demonstrate:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Systematic menstrual history taking with quantification of bleeding severity</li>
                <li>Assessment of impact on quality of life</li>
                <li>Recognition that patient age (48) + abnormal bleeding = MUST investigate for endometrial cancer</li>
                <li>Identification of anaemia symptoms</li>
                <li>Appropriate differential diagnosis (fibroids vs polyps vs adenomyosis vs endometrial pathology)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Station Objectives</h3>
            <p>This station assesses the candidate's ability to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Take a systematic gynaecological history for abnormal uterine bleeding</li>
                <li>Quantify bleeding severity using objective measures (pad/tampon count, clot size, flooding)</li>
                <li>Assess quality of life impact (QOL - work, social, emotional)</li>
                <li>Recognize AGE >45 years as indication for endometrial sampling (cancer exclusion)</li>
                <li>Identify symptoms/signs of anaemia</li>
                <li>Formulate appropriate differential diagnosis and investigation plan</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Key Clinical Features</h3>
            <p><strong>This Patient Has:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>🚨 <strong>Age 48 years</strong> - perimenopausal, HIGH RISK for endometrial pathology</li>
                <li>🚨 <strong>Heavy menstrual bleeding</strong> - objective criteria met (>8 products/day, flooding, clots >2cm)</li>
                <li>🚨 <strong>Symptoms of anaemia</strong> - fatigue, dyspnoea, dizziness, pallor</li>
                <li><strong>Pelvic pressure symptoms</strong> - suggests structural pathology (fibroids/adenomyosis)</li>
                <li><strong>Urinary frequency</strong> - bladder compression from fibroids</li>
                <li><strong>Family history of fibroids</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Progressive worsening</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Significant QOL impact</strong> - work absence, social restriction, emotional distress</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="fail-criteria">
                <h4>🚨 CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (Failure to meet = automatic fail)</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>MUST recognize age >45 + abnormal bleeding = ENDOMETRIAL SAMPLING required</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>MUST quantify bleeding severity</strong> (ask about pad/tampon count, clots, flooding)</li>
                    <li><strong>MUST assess impact on quality of life</strong> (work, social, emotional impact)</li>
                    <li><strong>MUST ask about intermenstrual and postcoital bleeding</strong> (red flags for malignancy)</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h3>Timing Instructions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Allow 7 minutes for history taking</li>
                <li>Give 1-minute warning at 7 minutes</li>
                <li>Ask for summary, differential diagnosis, and investigation plan in final minute</li>
                <li>Total station time: 8 minutes</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Expected Summary</h3>
            <p>The candidate should provide a concise summary including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Patient demographics and presenting complaint</li>
                <li>Quantified bleeding severity</li>
                <li>Anaemia symptoms identified</li>
                <li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Heavy menstrual bleeding, likely secondary to fibroids, with iron-deficiency anaemia</li>
                <li><strong>Differential:</strong> Fibroids (most likely), adenomyosis, endometrial polyps, endometrial hyperplasia/cancer (MUST be excluded)</li>
                <li><strong>Investigations:</strong> 🚨 FBC (check Hb), 🚨 Endometrial sampling (pipelle biopsy or hysteroscopy - MANDATORY for age >45), Pelvic ultrasound (assess for fibroids/structural abnormalities)</li>
                <li><strong>Management options:</strong> Medical (tranexamic acid, Mirena IUD) vs surgical (hysteroscopy, endometrial ablation, hysterectomy)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Patient Summary</h3>
            <p><strong>"This is Jennifer Watson, a 48-year-old woman, G2P2, presenting with heavy menstrual bleeding for 18 months with progressive worsening. She has objective evidence of severe menorrhagia (flooding, large clots, >10 tampons/day), symptoms of iron-deficiency anaemia, pelvic pressure symptoms suggesting fibroids, and significant quality of life impact. Given her age (48 years) and abnormal bleeding, endometrial sampling is MANDATORY to exclude endometrial malignancy."</strong></p>

            <h3>Management - eTG & RANZCOG 2024 Guidelines</h3>

            <h4>IMMEDIATE Management:</h4>

            <p><strong>1. Treat Anaemia</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Oral iron supplementation:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ferrous sulfate 200mg PO daily (or BD-TDS if tolerated)</li>
                        <li>Take on empty stomach with vitamin C for better absorption</li>
                        <li>Common side effects: nausea, constipation, black stools (warn patient)</li>
                        <li>Recheck FBC in 4-6 weeks</li>
                        <li>Continue for 3 months after Hb normalizes (to replenish iron stores)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>IV iron (if severe anaemia <80 g/L OR oral iron not tolerated):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Iron polymaltose (Ferrinject) 1000mg IV infusion</li>
                        <li>Rapid Hb rise (usually within 2-4 weeks)</li>
                        <li>Better tolerated than oral iron</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>2. Acute Bleeding Control (Interim Measure While Awaiting Investigation)</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tranexamic acid (first-line medical treatment for HMB):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dose: 1g (two 500mg tablets) PO TDS during menstruation (days 1-5)</li>
                        <li>Mechanism: Anti-fibrinolytic, reduces bleeding by 40-50%</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>NSAIDs (adjunct):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mefenamic acid 500mg PO TDS during menstruation (days 1-5)</li>
                        <li>Reduces bleeding by 20-30% + provides pain relief</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>DEFINITIVE Management (After Investigation Results):</h4>

            <p><strong>Management depends on:</strong></p>

            <h3>Recommended Management Plan for This Patient:</h3>

            <p><strong>Step 1: URGENT investigations (next 2 weeks):</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>FBC today (assess anaemia)</li>
                <li>Start oral iron (ferrous sulfate 200mg daily)</li>
                <li>Start tranexamic acid 1g TDS during menstruation (symptom relief)</li>
                <li>Arrange pipelle endometrial biopsy within 2 weeks (MANDATORY - exclude cancer)</li>
                <li>Arrange pelvic ultrasound within 2 weeks (assess for fibroids/structural causes)</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Step 2: Review results (2-3 weeks):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>If endometrial biopsy = BENIGN + USS shows fibroids:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Discuss options: Mirena IUD (first-line) vs endometrial ablation vs hysterectomy</li>
                        <li>Recommended: Trial Mirena IUD first (least invasive, 90% effective)</li>
                        <li>If patient wants definitive cure: Laparoscopic hysterectomy (keep ovaries)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>If endometrial biopsy = HYPERPLASIA (without atypia):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>High-dose progestogen therapy (medroxyprogesterone 10-20mg daily for 12-14 days/month)</li>
                        <li>OR Mirena IUD (treats hyperplasia + reduces bleeding)</li>
                        <li>Repeat biopsy in 3-6 months to ensure regression</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>If endometrial biopsy = HYPERPLASIA with ATYPIA or CANCER:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>🚨 URGENT gynaecological oncology referral</li>
                        <li>Total hysterectomy + bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy</li>
                        <li>± Adjuvant radiotherapy/chemotherapy depending on staging</li>
                    </ul>

            </ul>

            <h3>Patient Counseling - Key Points</h3>

            <p><strong>What to tell Jennifer today:</strong></p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Acknowledge severity:</strong> "You're right to be concerned - what you're describing is heavy menstrual bleeding, and it's clearly having a major impact on your life. We take this seriously."</li>
                <li><strong>Explain investigations needed:</strong> "Because of your age (48) and the heavy bleeding, we need to do some tests to find the cause. The most important test is an endometrial biopsy - this takes a small sample from the lining of your womb to make sure there's nothing sinister like cancer. I know that sounds scary, but it's a routine test we do for all women over 45 with heavy bleeding."</li>
                <li><strong>Likely diagnosis:</strong> "Based on your symptoms - the heavy bleeding, pressure feeling, and your family history - I suspect you may have fibroids. These are very common benign growths in the womb. Your mum had them too. They're not cancer, but they can cause very heavy bleeding."</li>
                <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> "I'm going to organize blood tests today, and get you booked for the endometrial biopsy and ultrasound within the next 2 weeks. Once we have the results, we'll know exactly what we're dealing with and can discuss the best treatment options."</li>
                <li><strong>Immediate relief:</strong> "In the meantime, I'm going to start you on two things - iron tablets because I'm concerned you're anaemic from all the blood loss, and a medication called tranexamic acid that you take during your period to reduce the bleeding by about half."</li>
                <li><strong>Treatment options exist:</strong> "The good news is that there are very effective treatments for heavy bleeding - ranging from a hormone coil (Mirena) to minor procedures to hysterectomy if you want a definitive cure. We'll discuss all the options once we have your test results."</li>
                <li><strong>Address cancer concern:</strong> "I understand you're worried about cancer. That's exactly why we're doing the endometrial biopsy - to check for that. Most women with your symptoms have fibroids or hormonal changes, not cancer. But we always check to be safe."</li>
                <li><strong>Address hysterectomy concern:</strong> "I know you're worried about needing a hysterectomy. Hysterectomy is an option - and it's a very good one for many women - but it's not the only option. We have less invasive treatments we can try first, like the Mirena coil or endometrial ablation. And if you do end up having a hysterectomy, you won't go into menopause because we'd keep your ovaries. You'd just stop having periods - which might actually be a relief!"</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Red Flags to Warn Patient About (Safety Netting)</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>🚨 If bleeding becomes VERY heavy (soaking >2 pads/hour for 2+ hours) → present to ED</li>
                <li>🚨 If you pass large clots AND feel faint/dizzy → present to ED (significant blood loss)</li>
                <li>🚨 If bleeding between periods starts OR bleeding after sex → contact GP urgently (change in pattern)</li>
                <li>🚨 If severe pelvic pain develops → contact GP urgently (fibroid degeneration possible)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Australian-Specific Considerations</h3>

            <h2>⚠️ IMG Common Mistakes - Critical Errors to Avoid</h2>

            <p><strong>Heavy menstrual bleeding is the most common reason for gynaecological referral in Australia. Missing endometrial cancer in a woman >45 is a CRITICAL FAILURE. These 10 mistakes will lead to automatic failure in AMC OSCE.</strong></p>

            <div class="mistake">
                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #1: Not Recognizing Age >45 + Abnormal Bleeding = MANDATORY Endometrial Sampling</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> RANZCOG 2024 guideline states ALL women aged ≥45 years with abnormal uterine bleeding MUST have endometrial sampling to exclude endometrial cancer/hyperplasia. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE in Australian practice. Endometrial cancer peaks age 60-70, but 15-20% occur in women <50. Not recognizing this = patient safety failure.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> IMG candidates diagnose "likely fibroids" based on symptoms and suggest pelvic ultrasound only. They forget that ultrasound does NOT exclude endometrial cancer - you MUST sample the endometrium in women >45.
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: In ANY woman aged ≥45 with abnormal uterine bleeding, your investigation plan MUST include: (1) FBC, (2) ENDOMETRIAL SAMPLING (pipelle biopsy or hysteroscopy), (3) Pelvic ultrasound. You must state "Endometrial sampling is mandatory to exclude endometrial cancer given her age."
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #2: Not Quantifying Bleeding Severity</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> "Heavy periods" is subjective - one woman's "heavy" is another woman's "normal." You MUST quantify bleeding using objective measures: pad/tampon count per day, clot size, flooding episodes, duration of bleeding. Without quantification, you cannot assess severity or monitor treatment response.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> IMG candidates ask "How heavy is the bleeding?" and patient says "Very heavy." Candidate accepts this without follow-up. Australian OSCE expects systematic quantification.
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: Ask: (1) "How many pads or tampons do you use per day?" (>8 = severe), (2) "Do you pass clots? How big?" (>2cm = abnormal), (3) "Do you ever flood through onto your clothes?" (flooding = severe), (4) "How long does bleeding last?" (>7 days = prolonged), (5) "How often do periods come?" (<21 days = frequent).
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #3: Not Asking About Intermenstrual and Postcoital Bleeding</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> Intermenstrual bleeding (IMB - bleeding between periods) and postcoital bleeding (PCB - bleeding after sex) are RED FLAGS for malignancy (endometrial cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial polyps). Not asking = missing critical diagnostic clues.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> IMG candidates focus on heavy menstrual bleeding and forget to ask about bleeding at OTHER times. IMB/PCB significantly changes the differential and urgency of investigation.
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: ALWAYS ask: (1) "Do you have any bleeding between your periods?" (IMB), (2) "Do you have any bleeding after sex?" (PCB). If YES to either → higher suspicion for malignancy/polyps → more urgent investigation.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #4: Not Assessing Quality of Life Impact</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> Heavy menstrual bleeding profoundly affects women's lives - work absence, social restriction, anxiety, depression, relationship strain. QOL impact is a MAJOR factor in deciding treatment (e.g., surgical vs medical management). Not assessing QOL = incomplete holistic assessment.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> IMG candidates gather clinical facts but don't ask about the HUMAN impact: "How is this affecting your daily life? Work? Social activities? Relationships?" Australian medicine emphasizes patient-centered care.
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: Ask: (1) "How is this affecting your work?" (time off, concentration), (2) "Impact on social life?" (cancelled activities, restrictions), (3) "How do you feel emotionally?" (anxiety, low mood), (4) "Impact on relationships/sex life?" Women with severe QOL impact often prefer surgical management (hysterectomy/ablation) over medical.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #5: Not Screening for Anaemia Symptoms</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> Chronic heavy bleeding → iron-deficiency anaemia in 50-60% of women with menorrhagia. Severe anaemia can cause heart failure (high-output cardiac failure). Not recognizing anaemia symptoms means you don't treat it urgently.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> IMG candidates focus on the bleeding but don't ask: "Do you feel tired? Short of breath? Dizzy? Do you look pale?" Missing severe anaemia (Hb <70 g/L) could mean patient needs blood transfusion.
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: ALWAYS screen for anaemia symptoms in heavy menstrual bleeding: (1) "How's your energy level? Feeling tired?" (fatigue), (2) "Do you get short of breath easily?" (exertional dyspnoea), (3) "Any dizziness?" (postural hypotension), (4) "Has anyone said you look pale?" (pallor), (5) "Any palpitations or chest pain?" (cardiac compensation). Then check FBC urgently and start iron supplementation.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #6: Not Asking About Future Fertility Wishes</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> Treatment choices differ dramatically based on fertility wishes. Endometrial ablation and hysterectomy are CONTRAINDICATED if patient wants future pregnancy. Not asking = inappropriate treatment recommendation.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> IMG candidates assume woman aged 48 doesn't want more children and recommend ablation/hysterectomy without asking. Some women want to preserve fertility even at 48 (e.g., new relationship, previous pregnancy loss).
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: ALWAYS ask: (1) "Do you have children?" (obstetric history), (2) "Are you planning any future pregnancies?" or "Is your family complete?" If patient wants to preserve fertility → options limited to medical management (Mirena, tranexamic acid) or myomectomy. If family complete → endometrial ablation and hysterectomy are options.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #7: Not Asking About Last Cervical Screening Test</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> Cervical cancer can present with heavy bleeding (though more commonly IMB/PCB). If cervical screening is overdue, patient needs screening + speculum examination to exclude cervical pathology. Not asking = incomplete gynae assessment.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> IMG candidates assume heavy menstrual bleeding = uterine problem and don't consider cervical causes. Australian OSCE expects comprehensive gynae history including screening status.
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: Ask "When was your last cervical screening test (CST)?" Australia uses 5-yearly HPV-based screening. If overdue (>5 years) → arrange CST. If up-to-date and normal → cervical cancer unlikely. Document screening status in all gynae consultations.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #8: Not Asking About Pressure Symptoms (Missing Fibroids)</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> Fibroids cause heavy bleeding AND pressure/bulk symptoms: pelvic fullness, urinary frequency, constipation, abdominal distension. Not asking about pressure symptoms means you miss the clinical clue that suggests fibroids rather than other causes (adenomyosis, polyps, dysfunctional bleeding).
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> IMG candidates ask about bleeding but don't ask "Do you feel any pressure or fullness in your pelvis?" Large fibroids can be palpable abdominally - if candidate doesn't ask about pressure/bloating, they miss the diagnosis.
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: Ask about PRESSURE SYMPTOMS: (1) "Do you feel any pressure or heaviness in your lower tummy?" (pelvic mass), (2) "Have you noticed your abdomen getting bigger or clothes feeling tighter?" (enlarged uterus), (3) "How often do you pass urine?" (urinary frequency from bladder compression), (4) "Any constipation?" (rectal pressure). These symptoms point to STRUCTURAL cause (fibroids/adenomyosis) rather than functional bleeding.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #9: Using "Wait and See" Approach in Woman >45</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> In a woman <45 with heavy bleeding and no red flags, expectant management ("let's see if it settles") may be acceptable SHORT-TERM. But in woman ≥45, you CANNOT use "wait and see" - you MUST investigate to exclude malignancy. Suggesting "wait and see" in a 48-year-old = unsafe practice.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> IMG candidates think "She's perimenopausal, periods will stop soon, let's wait" - THIS IS WRONG. Perimenopause is a HIGH-RISK time for endometrial cancer (unopposed oestrogen from anovulatory cycles).
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: In woman ≥45 with abnormal bleeding, your plan MUST include: (1) FBC now, (2) Endometrial sampling within 2-4 weeks, (3) Pelvic USS within 2-4 weeks. Say "We need to investigate this to make sure there's nothing serious like cancer." Do NOT suggest "wait and see" - this is unsafe in this age group.

            </div>

            <div class="mistake">
                <div class="mistake-title">❌ MISTAKE #10: Not Showing Empathy for Significant QOL Impact</div>
                <div class="mistake-explanation">
                    <strong>Why this fails:</strong> This patient is flooding through clothes at work, missing work, too exhausted to exercise, anxious about bleeding, relationship strain. If candidate treats this as "routine heavy periods" without acknowledging the profound impact, they fail the communication/empathy domain.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>What happens:</strong> IMG candidates focus intensely on clinical facts and forget the patient is suffering. Patient becomes tearful when describing work embarrassment and candidate doesn't respond empathetically.
                </div>
                <div class="correct-approach">
                    ✅ CORRECT: Show empathy throughout: (1) "That sounds really distressing - flooding at work must be so embarrassing and stressful," (2) "I can see this is really affecting your quality of life - we're going to find the cause and get this sorted for you," (3) When patient becomes tearful: pause, offer tissue, acknowledge distress. Use phrases like "I can see this has been really difficult for you" and "You're right to seek help - this isn't something you should just put up with."

                <h4>🎯 IMG Success Tips for Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Stations:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Memorize the age cutoff:</strong> Age ≥45 + abnormal bleeding = ENDOMETRIAL SAMPLING mandatory. This is the single most important fact.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use a structured approach for bleeding assessment:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Frequency (cycle length)</li>
                            <li>Duration (days of bleeding)</li>
                            <li>Severity (pad count, clots, flooding) - QUANTIFY</li>
                            <li>Intermenstrual bleeding? (IMB)</li>
                            <li>Postcoital bleeding? (PCB)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Ask about the "3 Ps" for fibroids:</strong> Pressure (pelvic fullness), Pee (urinary frequency), Poo (constipation)</li>
                    <li><strong>Screen for anaemia EVERY TIME:</strong> Fatigue, dyspnoea, dizziness, pallor - then FBC + iron</li>
                    <li><strong>Assess QOL impact systematically:</strong> Work + Social + Emotional. This demonstrates patient-centered care.</li>
                    <li><strong>Know the management ladder (from least to most invasive):</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Tranexamic acid (non-hormonal, safe, 40-50% reduction)</li>
                            <li>Mirena IUD (hormonal, 90% reduction, gold standard medical)</li>
                            <li>Endometrial ablation (minimally invasive surgical, 90% reduction)</li>
                            <li>Hysterectomy (definitive surgical cure, 100%)</li>

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Practice your investigation plan:</strong> "I would arrange three things: (1) Blood test today to check for anaemia, (2) Endometrial biopsy within 2 weeks to exclude cancer - this is mandatory given your age, and (3) Pelvic ultrasound to look for fibroids or other structural causes."</li>
                    <li><strong>Remember Australian terminology:</strong> "Heavy menstrual bleeding" (HMB) or "menorrhagia," not "dysfunctional uterine bleeding" (DUB - outdated term). "Pipelle biopsy" not just "endometrial biopsy." "Cervical screening test" (CST) not "Pap smear."</li>
