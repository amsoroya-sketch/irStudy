## INTRODUCTION

### Why This Matters for AMC Clinical OSCE

**Examiners assess how you respond to emotion,not just how you deliver information**

Marks are awarded for:
- **Recognizing** the emotional response
- **Naming** the emotion (empathy statement)
- **Validating** the emotion as normal
- **Responding** appropriately with words and body language
- **Not rushing** past the emotion
- **Sitting with discomfort**

### The Universal Truth

**There is NO "correct" emotional response to bad news.**

Every reaction listed below is normal and valid. Your job is not to "fix" the emotion or make the patient feel better (you can't), but to:
1. Witness their pain
2. Acknowledge it
3. Sit with them in it
4. Provide information and support when they're ready

## FUNDAMENTAL RESPONSE PRINCIPLES

### The 5 Core Skills

**1. SILENCE**
- Most IMG candidates fear silence and rush to fill it
- Silence after bad news is essential
- Count to 10 slowly in your head before speaking again
- Patients need time to process

**2. NAMING THE EMOTION**
- "I can see you're feeling [angry/scared/overwhelmed]."
- "This is [devastating/shocking/frightening]."
- Naming validates

**3. NORMALIZING**
- "This is a completely normal reaction."
- "Anyone would feel this way."
- "There's no right or wrong way to feel."

**4. NON-VERBAL SUPPORT**
- Tissues within reach
- Lean forward slightly (engagement)
- Eye contact (but not staring)
- Open body language (uncrossed arms)
- Appropriate touch if culturally suitable (hand on shoulder - ask first: "May I?")

**5. PATIENCE**
- Don't rush to "next steps"
- Sit with the emotion first
- Information can wait

## REACTION-SPECIFIC GUIDES

---

### REACTION 1: CRYING (Most Common)

**Recognition**:
- Tears (may be silent or sobbing)
- Voice breaking
- Looking down
- Reaching for tissues

**Physiology**: Natural grief response, stress hormone release

**Your Response - Step by Step**:

1. **Stop talking immediately** (0-5 seconds)
   - Don't finish your sentence
   - Your words don't matter anymore - their emotion does

2. **Provide tissues** (5-10 seconds)
   - Place tissue box within reach or hand one tissue
   - If they're holding tissue already, just wait

3. **Silence** (10-60 seconds)
   - Allow crying without interruption
   - Don't say "don't cry" or "it's okay"
   - Your presence is the support

4. **Gentle validation** (after crying subsides slightly - 60-90 seconds)
   - "I can see this is very difficult for you."
   - "I'm so sorry."
   - "Take your time. There's no rush."

5. **Check readiness to continue** (90-120 seconds)
   - "Would you like a moment, or can I continue?"
   - "Is there anything I can get you? Some water?"

**What to Say**:
- ✅ "This is heartbreaking news." ✅ "I'm very sorry."
- ✅ "Take all the time you need."
- ✅ *Silence*

**What NOT to Say**:
- ❌ "Don't cry."
- ❌ "You need to be strong."
- ❌ "It's going to be okay." (You don't know that)
- ❌ "At least..." (Never minimize)

**Body Language**:
- Lean forward
- Hand tissue box or tissues
- If culturally appropriate and patient receptive: Hand on forearm (ask: "May I?")
- Don't look away - witness their pain

**Duration**: 60-90 seconds minimum before moving on

**OSCE Tip**: Examiners specifically watch for:
- ✅ Did candidate stop talking when patient cried?
- ✅ Did candidate provide tissues?
- ✅ Did candidate allow silence?
- ✅ Did candidate show empathy?

**Common IMG Mistake**:
- Continuing to talk through patient's crying
- Becoming visibly uncomfortable and rushing past the emotion
- Not providing tissues

---

### REACTION 2: SILENCE / SHOCK

**Recognition**:
- Patient goes completely still
- Blank stare
- Not blinking
- Pale
- No verbal response
- May look "frozen"

**Physiology**: Acute stress response, brain overwhelmed, emotional shutdown

**Your Response - Step by Step**:

1. **Immediate silence** (0-10 seconds)
   - Don't repeat yourself
   - Don't ask "are you okay?"
   - Just wait

2. **Extended silence** (10-30 seconds)
   - Count to 20 slowly in your head
   - Maintain gentle eye contact
   - Don't fidget

3. **Gentle check-in** (30-45 seconds)
   - "I know this is an enormous shock."
   - *Pause 5 seconds*
   - "Take your time."

4. **Offer water** (45-60 seconds)
   - "Can I get you some water?"
   - Physical action can help patient "re-enter"

5. **Don't force conversation** (60+ seconds)
   - "There's no rush. We can sit here as long as you need."
   - Some patients need minutes of silence

6. **Check understanding when ready** (variable)
   - "When you're ready, would it help if I explain anything?"

**What to Say**:
- ✅ "I know this is a lot to take in."
- ✅ "This is shocking news."
- ✅ "Take all the time you need."
- ✅ *Comfortable silence*

**What NOT to Say**:
- ❌ "Did you hear me?" (Yes, they heard - they're processing)
- ❌ "Do you understand?" (Not the issue)
- ❌ Repeating the diagnosis immediately

**Body Language**:
- Still, calm presence
- Gentle eye contact (but don't stare)
- Slight forward lean showing you're present
- Hands visible, relaxed

**Duration**: 30-60 seconds of silence; total 60-120 seconds before attempting to move forward

**OSCE Tip**:
- ✅ Can you sit in silence without fidgeting?
- ✅ Do you look comfortable with discomfort?
- ✅ Do you rush to fill silence? (Don't)

**Cultural Note**:
- Some cultures show emotion outwardly (crying, wailing)
- Others show emotion inwardly (silence, stillness)
- Both are equally valid grief responses

---

### REACTION 3: ANGER

**Recognition**:
- Raised voice
- Accusatory statements: "How could you let this happen?"
- Finger pointing
- Standing up
- Aggressive body language (arms crossed, leaning forward aggressively)
- Swearing
- "This is YOUR fault!"

**Physiology**: Anger is a secondary emotion - usually covering fear, helplessness, or grief

**Your Response - Step by Step**:

1. **Stay calm** (CRITICAL - 0-10 seconds)
   - Don't mirror anger
   - Lower your own voice
   - Slow your speech
   - Take a breath

2. **Don't take it personally** (0-60 seconds)
   - Patient is not angry at YOU (even if they say they are)
   - They're angry at the situation
   - Remind yourself: This is displacement

3. **Validate the anger** (10-30 seconds)
   - "I can see you're very angry."
   - "You have every right to be angry."
   - "This is devastating news."

4. **Listen without defending** (30-90 seconds)
   - Let them vent
   - Don't interrupt
   - Don't explain or justify
   - Just listen

5. **Acknowledge feeling** (90-120 seconds)
   - "I hear your anger. This is incredibly unfair."
   - "Anyone would be furious in your position."

6. **Set boundaries if needed** (only if abusive/threatening)
   - "I understand you're upset, but I need you to please not shout at me/swear at me."
   - "I want to help you, but I need us to communicate respectfully."

7. **Refocus on helping** (120+ seconds)
   - "I know you're angry. What can I do right now to help you?"

**What to Say**:
- ✅ "I can see you're very angry, and that's completely understandable."
- ✅ "This is unfair. Anyone would be furious."
- ✅ "I hear you."
- ✅ "I know you're not angry at me - you're angry at this situation."

**What NOT to Say**:
- ❌ "You need to calm down." (Will make them angrier)
- ❌ "Don't be angry." (Invalidating)
- ❌ "It's not that bad." (Minimizing)
- ❌ "There's no need to shout." (Defensive)
- ❌ Anything defensive about medical care

**Body Language**:
- Stay seated (don't stand unless safety concern)
- Open, non-defensive posture
- Don't cross arms
- Don't roll eyes or look exasperated
- Maintain calm eye contact
- Don't lean back (looks defensive)

**Voice**:
- Lower and slower than patient's
- Calm, steady tone
- Don't match their volume

**Duration**: 90-120 seconds; let them vent fully

**When to Set Boundaries**:

**If patient swears**:
- Mild swearing (e.g., "This is fucking unbelievable"): Allow it, ignore it
- Swearing AT you (e.g., "You're a fucking idiot"): Set boundary

**If patient threatens**:
- "I'm going to sue you/this hospital!"
  - Don't respond to threat
  - "I understand you're very upset right now."
- Physical threat: "I'm going to hit you!"
  - Stand up, move toward door
  - "I don't feel safe continuing this conversation. I'm going to step out and come back when you're calmer."
  - Leave, inform senior, consider security

**OSCE Tip**:
- ✅ Did you stay calm?
- ✅ Did you validate the anger?
- ✅ Did you avoid being defensive?
- ✅ Did you set appropriate boundaries if needed?

**Common IMG Mistake**:
- Becoming defensive: "I didn't cause this!"

### REACTION 4: DENIAL

**Recognition**:
- "You've made a mistake."
- "The test must be wrong."
- "I don't believe you."
- "This can't be true."
- Shaking head repeatedly
- "I feel fine, there's nothing wrong with me."

**Physiology**: Psychological defense mechanism; brain can't process reality yet

**Your Response - Step by Step**:

1. **Don't argue** (CRITICAL - 0-30 seconds)
   - You cannot logic someone out of denial
   - Arguing entrenches denial further
   - Denial is protective - respect it initially

2. **Acknowledge the disbelief** (10-30 seconds)
   - "I understand this is very hard to believe."
   - "This doesn't feel real."

3. **Gentle persistence** (30-60 seconds)
   - "I wish I had different news to give you."
   - "Unfortunately, the test results are definitive."

4. **Offer evidence calmly** (60-90 seconds)
   - "We did two separate tests to be certain."
   - "I've reviewed the results carefully."

5. **Don't insist they accept it NOW** (90+ seconds)
   - "I know this is overwhelming and hard to accept."
   - "It's okay to need time to process this."

6. **Offer support for when reality hits** (120+ seconds)
   - "When you're ready to talk about next steps, I'm here."

**What to Say**:
- ✅ "I understand you don't want this to be true."
- ✅ "I wish I were wrong, but unfortunately the results are clear."
- ✅ "It's normal to feel disbelief when you hear news like this."
- ✅ "Take your time processing this."

**What NOT to Say**:
- ❌ "You need to accept this." (Pushy)
- ❌ "It IS true whether you believe it or not." (Argumentative)
- ❌ "You're in denial." (Labeling, unhelpful)

**How to Handle Specific Denials**:

**"The test must be wrong"**:
- "I understand you want to be absolutely sure. We did [specific tests]. Both confirmed the diagnosis."
- If they insist: "You have the right to a second opinion if you'd like. I can facilitate that."

**"I feel fine, so I can't have [cancer/HIV/etc.]"**:
- "Many serious conditions don't have symptoms in the early stages."
- "That's actually why this test was important - to catch things before symptoms develop."

**"This happens to other people, not me"**:
- "I know this feels impossible to believe."
- "Unfortunately, this diagnosis affects 1 in [X] people. It can happen to anyone."

**Duration**: 60-90 seconds; don't force acceptance

**OSCE Tip**:
- ✅ Did you avoid arguing?
- ✅ Did you stay calm and empathetic?
- ✅ Did you gently persist with truth?
- ✅ Did you offer second opinion option?

**Follow-up**:
- Patients in denial often return 24-48 hours later, having processed
- "I've been thinking about what you said..."
- This is normal progression

   - "I understand you want to do everything possible."
   - "It's natural to want to have some control over this."

2. **Validate the question** (30-60 seconds)
   - "That's a good question."
   - "I'm glad you're thinking about what you can do."

3. **Be honest about what WILL help** (60-90 seconds)
   - "While we can't make this go away, there are things that will help:
     - Treatment (specify)
     - Lifestyle changes (if applicable)
     - Support systems"

4. **Be honest about what WON'T help** (90+ seconds)
   - "Unfortunately, [dieting alone/exercise alone/alternative medicine instead of treatment] won't cure this."
   - "But [diet/exercise] can help you feel better and cope with treatment."

**What to Say**:

**For cancer**: "If I change my diet, will the cancer go away?"
- ✅ "Diet alone can't cure cancer, but good nutrition helps your body cope with treatment and recover."
- ✅ "What WILL help is the chemotherapy/surgery we're planning."

**For chronic disease** (diabetes, heart disease): "If I exercise every day, can I reverse this?"
- ✅ "Exercise is really important and can improve your condition significantly."
- ✅ "Combined with medication and diet, we can control this well, though we can't completely reverse the damage already done."

**For genetic/unchangeable conditions**: "If I had done X differently, would this not have happened?"
- ✅ "No - this was not caused by anything you did or didn't do."
- ✅ "This was going to happen regardless."

**What NOT to Say**:

**Your Response - Step by Step**:

1. **Don't judge** (CRITICAL - 0-30 seconds)
   - Relief is a valid reaction
   - It doesn't mean they don't understand severity
   - They're relieved to have answers, not happy about diagnosis

- "What's the pathophysiology?"
- "What are the mutation rates?"
- "I've read about this condition - is it the XYZ subtype?"
- No visible emotion
- Wants statistics, studies, technical detail

**Physiology**: Coping mechanism - focusing on facts to avoid feeling emotions

**Your Response - Step by Step**:

1. **Don't judge** (0-30 seconds)
   - This is how some people process
   - Often healthcare workers, scientists, engineers
   - Knowledge gives them sense of control

- Self-directed anger

**Context**: Especially common in:
- Lifestyle-related diseases (lung cancer in smoker)
- Pregnancy loss
- STIs
- Preventable conditions

**Physiology**: Attempt to find meaning/cause in random events; need for control

**Your Response - Step by Step**:

1. **Direct, firm reassurance** (0-30 seconds)
   - Be clear and unambiguous
   - "This is not your fault."
   - Don't soften it

   - Simple explanation of real cause
   - Remove blame

**Context-Specific Responses**:

**Miscarriage**: "Did I cause this? I lifted something heavy / had a glass of wine / was stressed."
- ✅ "No. You absolutely did not cause this."
- ✅ "Lifting, one glass of wine before you knew, normal stress - none of these cause miscarriage."
- ✅ "Most miscarriages are due to random chromosomal abnormalities - nothing you did or didn't do."

**Lung cancer in smoker**: "This is my fault - I should have quit smoking."
- ✅ "Smoking is a risk factor, yes. But many smokers never get lung cancer, and some non-smokers do."
- ✅ "Blaming yourself doesn't help you now."
- ✅ "What matters is moving forward with treatment."

**HIV**: "I should have been more careful."
- ✅ "What matters now is your health and treatment."
- ✅ "Many people with HIV contracted it before they had full information about safe sex."
- ✅ "Let's focus on keeping you healthy going forward."

- ✅ "No. Childhood cancer is not caused by anything parents do or don't do."
- ✅ "These are random genetic changes."
- ✅ "You are not responsible for this."

**What to Say**:
- ✅ "This is not your fault." (Firm, clear, direct)
- ✅ "You didn't cause this."
- ✅ "Even if you had [done X], this would have happened."

**What NOT to Say**:
- ❌ "Well, smoking/drinking/etc. didn't help." (Blaming)
- ❌ "You should have..." (Unhelpful)
- ❌ Soft reassurance that leaves room for doubt: "It's probably not your fault."

**Duration**: 60 seconds; be firm and clear

**OSCE Tip**:
- ✅ Clear, direct reassurance
- ✅ Don't leave room for ambiguity
- ✅ Firm "no" to self-blame

**Common IMG Mistake**:
- Soft reassurance that doesn't land firmly enough
- Focusing on "lifestyle factors" at this time (can come later)

### REACTION 12: EUTHANASIA / ASSISTED DYING REQUEST

**Recognition**:
- "I want to die."
- "Can you help me end my life?"
- "I'd rather die than go through this."
- "Why should I suffer?"
- "Euthanasia is legal now, right?"

**CRITICAL CONTEXT - Australian Law**:
- **Legal in**: Victoria (2019), Western Australia (2021), Tasmania (2022), Queensland (2023), South Australia (2023), Northern Territory (2023)
- **Illegal in**: NSW, ACT
- **Requirements** (where legal): Terminal illness, <12 months prognosis, decision-making capacity, residency requirements, multi-step approval process
- **NOT available for**: Non-terminal chronic conditions, disability, depression, dementia

**Risk Assessment**: ALWAYS assess suicide risk

**Your Response - Step by Step**:

1. **Don't be shocked** (CRITICAL - 0-10 seconds)
   - This is a common thought when hearing devastating news
   - Your reaction matters

2. **Acknowledge the feeling** (10-30 seconds)
   - "I hear that you're feeling this is too much to bear."
   - "That's an understandable reaction to such difficult news."

3. **Assess suicide risk** (30-90 seconds)
   - "When you say you want to die, are you having thoughts of hurting yourself?"
   - "Do you have a plan?"
   - If yes → psychiatric assessment, safety plan

4. **Explore the statement** (90-120 seconds)
   - "Can you tell me more about what you're feeling?"
   - Often this is about:
     - Fear of suffering
     - Fear of loss of dignity/control
     - Fear of being a burden
     - Uncontrolled symptoms (pain, breathlessness)

5. **Address fears directly** (120-180 seconds)
   - "I hear that you're frightened of suffering."
   - "We have excellent pain and symptom management available."
   - "Palliative care focuses on keeping you comfortable."

6. **Legal position** (180+ seconds)
   - **If in NSW/ACT**: "Euthanasia is not legal in [NSW/ACT]."
   - **If in VIC/WA/TAS/QLD/SA/NT**: "Voluntary assisted dying is legal in [state], but it has specific requirements. It's for people with a terminal illness who are expected to die within 6-12 months and meet other criteria. If you'd like information about it, I can arrange that."

7. **Emphasize palliative care** (Throughout)
   - "Our focus is on keeping you comfortable and maintaining your quality of life."
   - "Modern palliative care means people don't have to suffer."

8. **Hope within honesty** (180+ seconds)
   - "I know right now this feels unbearable."
   - "Let's take this one step at a time."
   - "Many people who have these thoughts initially find that treatment and support help enormously."

**What to Say**:

**If acute suicidal ideation**:
- ✅ "I'm concerned about your safety right now."
- ✅ "I'd like to have a colleague from psychiatry come and talk with you."
- ✅ "We're going to keep you safe."

**If expressing fear of future suffering**:
- ✅ "I hear that you're frightened of suffering. That's a completely understandable fear."
- ✅ "We have excellent pain management and symptom control."
- ✅ "People don't have to suffer through terminal illness - that's what palliative care is for."

**If specifically asking about VAD in legal state**:
- ✅ "Voluntary assisted dying is legal in [state]. There's a formal process with multiple steps to ensure it's your informed, voluntary choice."
- ✅ "I can provide you with information about the process if you'd like."
- ✅ "I'd also like you to speak with palliative care, to understand all your options for staying comfortable."

**If asking about VAD in NSW/ACT**:
- ✅ "Euthanasia is not legal in [NSW/ACT] currently."
- ✅ "What I can offer you is excellent symptom management through our palliative care team."

**What NOT to Say**:
- ❌ "Don't talk like that." (Dismissive)
- ❌ "You have so much to live for." (Invalidating)
- ❌ "Suicide is wrong." (Judgment)
- ❌ Providing information on how to end life (unethical)
- ❌ "Let's not think about that now." (Avoidant)

**Duration**: 90-120 seconds minimum; this requires time

**OSCE Tip**:
- ✅ Assess suicide risk
- ✅ Empathy for suffering
- ✅ Explain palliative care
- ✅ Know legal position in your state
- ✅ Psychiatric referral if acute risk

**Follow-up**:
- Palliative care referral (same day if possible)

- "I want a second opinion."
- "These labs must be wrong."
- "I want to see another doctor."
- Questioning your competence

**Your Response - Step by Step**:

1. **Don't be defensive** (CRITICAL - 0-30 seconds)
   - This is not a personal attack
   - It's a coping mechanism
   - Patient has the right to second opinion

2. **Validate the right to second opinion** (30-60 seconds)
   - "You absolutely have the right to a second opinion."
   - "I can help facilitate that."

3. **Explain test accuracy** (60-90 seconds)
   - "I understand you want to be completely certain."
   - "We did [X test and Y test]. Both confirmed the diagnosis."
   - "Repeating the test will give the same result."

4. **Support decision without being offended** (90+ seconds)
   - "If you'd like a second opinion, I can refer you to another [oncologist/specialist]."
   - "Or you can seek one independently - that's your right."

5. **Timeframe consideration** (if urgent):
   - "I respect your wish for a second opinion."
   - "I do want you to know that [time is a factor / treatment should start within X weeks]."
   - "Perhaps we can arrange an urgent second opinion so you can start treatment soon?"

**What to Say**:
- ✅ "You have every right to a second opinion, and I support that."
- ✅ "I understand you want to be absolutely certain - that's wise."
- ✅ "Would you like me to refer you to another specialist?"
- ✅ "While you're getting a second opinion, can we discuss the treatment I'd recommend, so you have that information?"

**What NOT to Say**:
- ❌ "You're wasting time." (Dismissive)
- ❌ "The test is definitely right." (Defensive)

- ❌ Looking offended

**Duration**: 60 seconds

**OSCE Tip**:
- ✅ Support patient autonomy
- ✅ Not defensive
- ✅ Facilitate second opinion
- ✅ Respectful throughout

**Often**: Patient gets second opinion, which confirms diagnosis, and returns to you

### REACTION 14: FAINTING / PHYSICAL COLLAPSE

**Recognition**:
- Patient goes pale
- Swaying
- Eyes roll back
- Loses consciousness
- Slumps forward or falls

**This is a MEDICAL EMERGENCY, not just emotional reaction**

2. **Call for help** (2-5 seconds)
   - Press emergency button if in hospital
   - Call out: "I need help in here!"
   - If alone with patient, call 000 (or hospital emergency)

3. **Position safely** (5-30 seconds)
   - If breathing: Recovery position (on side)
   - If not breathing: Flat on back, start CPR
   - Elevate legs if simple faint

4. **Check ABC** (30-60 seconds)
   - Airway - open, clear
   - Breathing - look, listen, feel
   - Circulation - check pulse

5. **Monitor** (60+ seconds)
   - Usually wake within 60 seconds if simple vasovagal syncope
   - If not waking, this is not a simple faint - medical emergency

6. **Once awake** (After recovery)
   - "You fainted. You're safe now. Stay lying down for a moment."
   - "Can you hear me? Can you tell me your name?"
   - Check orientation

   - Determine cause

8. **When stable - resume conversation**  (Much later)
   - "That was a big shock. How are you feeling now?"
   - "I know this is overwhelming news. Would you like to continue our conversation, or would you like to rest first?"

**What to Say (Once conscious)**:
- ✅ "You fainted. You're okay now."
- ✅ "Stay lying down for a bit longer."
- ✅ "I'm going to check your blood pressure."
- ✅ "That was a big shock to your system."

**What NOT to Do**:
- ❌ Leave patient alone
- ❌ Continue talking about diagnosis while they're unconscious
- ❌ Panic

**Duration**: Medical response until stable; defer diagnosis discussion

**OSCE Tip**:
- ✅ Immediate action - safety first
- ✅ Call for help
- ✅ ABC assessment
- ✅ Defer conversation until medically stable

**Causes to Consider**:
- Vasovagal syncope (emotional shock) - most common

### REACTION 15: EXPLOSIVE GRIEF / WAILING

**Recognition**:
- Loud crying / screaming
- Wailing
- "No, no, no, no!"
- Rocking
- Pulling hair
- Dramatic physical expression of grief

**Cultural Context**:
- Normal grief expression in many cultures (Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, some Asian, Pacific Islander, African)
- NOT pathological
- NOT "hysterical"
- Healthy grief expression

**Western medical culture often views this as "excessive"** - it's not. It's cultural.

**Your Response - Step by Step**:

1. **Allow it** (CRITICAL - 0-60 seconds)
   - Don't try to "calm them down"
   - Don't try to quiet them
   - Don't shush them
   - This is normal grief

2. **Ensure physical safety** (0-60 seconds)
   - If they're at risk of hurting themselves (hitting head, pulling hair out), gentle physical intervention
   - "I'm going to move this table so you don't hurt yourself."

3. **Stay present** (60-180 seconds)
   - Sit with them
   - Your presence is the support
   - Hand tissues
   - Don't leave them alone

4. **Gentle touch if appropriate** (60+ seconds)
   - If culturally appropriate: Hand on shoulder or back
   - Ask first if unsure: "May I?" [gesture to shoulder]

5. **Wait for wave to pass** (Variable - can be 5-10 minutes)
   - Grief comes in waves
   - Don't interrupt the wave
   - Just be there

6. **Soft validation when it subsides** (After wave passes)
   - "I'm so, so sorry."
   - "This is devastating."

**What to Say**:
- ✅ *Silence* (mostly)
- ✅ "I'm so sorry." (quietly)

### REACTION 16: NUMBNESS / DETACHMENT / FLAT AFFECT

**Recognition**:
- "Okay."
- No visible emotion
- Flat voice
- "I understand."
- Looks calm, almost indifferent
- No tears, no anger, no fear
- May say they're "fine"

**Physiology**: Emotional shock, dissociation, protective numbness

**This is NOT the same as "handling it well"** - emotions will likely hit later

**Your Response - Step by Step**:

1. **Don't assume they're okay** (CRITICAL - Throughout)
   - Flat affect often means overwhelm, not acceptance
   - They're numb, not coping

2. **Acknowledge the news** (0-30 seconds)
   - Even if they look calm, name the severity
   - "I know this is very serious news."

3. **Normalize delayed reaction** (30-60 seconds)
   - "Sometimes when we hear shocking news, it doesn't feel real immediately."
   - "Emotions often come later - hours or days later."
   - "That's completely normal."

4. **Check in gently** (60-90 seconds)
   - "How are you feeling right now?"
   - They may say "I don't know" or "I feel numb" - both valid

5. **Warn about delayed reaction** (90-120 seconds)
   - "In the next few days, as this sinks in, you may experience a lot of emotions."
   - "That's normal and expected."

6. **Provide resources for later** (120+ seconds)
   - "Here's my number. When this hits you - and it will - please call."
   - "Counselling is available if you need it."

7. **Check safety** (Before they leave)
   - "Do you have someone at home with you?"
   - "Please don't be alone tonight."

**What to Say**:
- ✅ "This is very serious news, even if it doesn't feel real right now."
- ✅ "Sometimes our minds protect us from overwhelming news by numbing us."
- ✅ "Emotions often come in waves later."
- ✅ "Please don't be alone over the next few days."

**What NOT to Say**:
- ❌ "You're handling this very well!" (Misinterpretation)
- ❌ "You seem okay with this." (Assumption)
- ❌ Moving too quickly to practical matters

**Duration**: 60-90 seconds; acknowledge and warn

**OSCE Tip**:
- ✅ Don't mistake numbness for coping
- ✅ Warn about delayed reaction
- ✅ Provide resources for when emotions hit
- ✅ Check safety

**Follow-up**:
- Call patient next day to check in
- Delayed grief reactions can be intense
- Some patients need psychiatric support for complicated grief

## WHAT NEVER TO SAY

### Universal "Never Say" List

These phrases fail in ALL situations when breaking bad news:

❌ **"I know how you feel."**
- You don't. Everyone's experience is unique.
- ✅ Instead: "I can't imagine how difficult this is for you."

❌ **"Everything happens for a reason."**
- Meaningless platitude, often offensive
- Implies there's a "good reason" for cancer/death/suffering
- ✅ Instead: *Don't try to find meaning - just witness their pain*

❌ **"God doesn't give you more than you can handle."**
- Theological assumption (not all patients religious)
- Factually wrong (people do get overwhelmed)
- Implies if they're struggling, they're weak or lacking faith
- ✅ Instead: *Don't invoke God unless patient does*

❌ **"You're so strong." / "You have to be strong."**
- Implies they can't show weakness or emotion
- Invalidates their right to fall apart
- ✅ Instead: "It's okay to not be okay."

❌ **"At least..."**
- "At least you caught it early."
- "At least it's not [worse thing]."
- "At least you have other children." (after child's death)
- ALWAYS minimizes their pain
- ✅ Instead: Acknowledge the loss without comparison

❌ **"Don't cry."**
- Invalidates healthy emotional expression
- ✅ Instead: Allow crying, provide tissues, sit quietly

❌ **"It could be worse."**
- Minimizes their suffering
- ✅ Instead: Acknowledge that this IS bad

❌ **"You'll be fine." / "It'll be okay."**
- False reassurance
- You don't know if they'll be fine
- ✅ Instead: "We'll do everything we can."

❌ **"Time heals all wounds."**
- Platitude, unhelpful
- Not always true
- ✅ Instead: "This will be hard, but we'll support you."

❌ **"Stay positive!"**
- Toxic positivity
- Invalidates legitimate fear and sadness
- ✅ Instead: "It's okay to feel however you feel."

❌ **"My [aunt/friend/cousin] had this and..."**
- If story ends badly: terrifying to patient
- If story ends well: false hope, everyone's different
- Makes conversation about YOU, not them
- ✅ Instead: Keep focus on THEIR situation

❌ **"You're young, you'll have other children."** (after miscarriage)
- Invalidates grief for THIS baby
- ✅ Instead: "I'm so sorry for your loss."

❌ **"At least you had X years together."** (after death)
- Minimizes grief
- ✅ Instead: "I'm so sorry for your loss."

❌ **"Call me if you need anything."**
- Too vague, patient won't call
- ✅ Instead: "I'm going to call you in 2 days to check how you're doing."

## PRACTICE SCENARIOS

### Practice Exercise 1: Identify the Reaction

**Read each scenario. Name the emotional reaction and write your response.**

1. Patient receives cancer diagnosis. Goes completely still. Stares at you. Doesn't speak for 30 seconds.
   - Reaction: _______________
   - Your response: _______________

2. Patient receives HIV diagnosis. Immediately asks: "What's the CD4 count? What's the viral load? Which medications will I be on? What are the side effects? What's the 5-year survival rate?"
   - Reaction: _______________
   - Your response: _______________

3. You tell a mother her child has leukemia. She starts wailing loudly, rocking back and forth, crying "No, no, no!"
   - Reaction: _______________
   - Your response: _______________

4. You tell a patient they've had a miscarriage. Patient says: "Did I cause this by lifting that box? Is this my fault?"
   - Reaction: _______________
   - Your response: _______________

5. You tell a patient they have dementia. Patient says: "No, the test must be wrong. I want another test. You've made a mistake."
   - Reaction: _______________
   - Your response: _______________

**Answer Key**:
1. Silence/Shock → *Comfortable silence 10-30 seconds, then "I know this is an enormous shock. Take your time."*
2. Intellectualization → *Answer questions factually, gentle check-in: "I'm giving you a lot of information. How are you feeling about this?"*
3. Explosive grief → *Allow it, stay present, tissues, "I'm so, so sorry." Don't try to quiet her.*
4. Guilt/Self-blame → *Direct, firm: "No. You absolutely did not cause this. This was not your fault."*
5. Denial/Disbelief → *Don't argue. "I understand this is hard to believe. Unfortunately, the test results are definitive. You have the right to a second opinion if you'd like."*

---

### Practice Exercise 2: Role Play

**Practice with a partner. One person is doctor, one is patient.**

**Scenario**: Breaking news of terminal pancreatic cancer

**Patient instructions**: React with [anger / silence / crying / intellectualization - choose one]

**Doctor**: Deliver news, respond to emotion

**Observer** (if 3 people): Use checklist:
- □ Did doctor stop talking when patient showed emotion?
- □ Did doctor name the emotion?
- □ Did doctor validate the reaction as normal?
- □ Did doctor sit in silence when appropriate?
- □ Did doctor's body language show compassion?
- □ Did doctor avoid the "Never Say" phrases?

**Rotate roles and try different emotional reactions.**

---

### Practice Exercise 3: Video Recording

**Record yourself delivering bad news to a simulated patient.**

**Watch the video and self-assess**:
- How long did you allow silence after delivering the news?
- What was your body language like?
- Did you fidget?
- What was your facial expression?
- Did you rush?
- How was your voice - pace, tone, volume?

**Do this 10 times. You'll improve dramatically.**

---

## FINAL WORDS

**Breaking bad news is one of the hardest things you'll do as a doctor.**

No amount of reading prepares you fully. Experience teaches. But these principles will guide you:

1. **Slow down**
2. **Sit with discomfort**
3. **Witness their pain**
4. **Validate every emotion**
5. **Be human**

**You cannot make bad news "not bad."**
**Your job is not to fix their pain.**
**Your job is to deliver truth with compassion, sit with them in their worst moment, and help them find a path forward.**

**That is enough.**
