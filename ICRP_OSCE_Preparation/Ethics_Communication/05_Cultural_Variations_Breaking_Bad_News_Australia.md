## INTRODUCTION

### Why This Matters for AMC Clinical

**Australia is one of the world's most multicultural nations:**
- 30% of population born overseas
- 300+ languages spoken
- Every major world religion represented
- AMC Clinical OSCE specifically tests cultural competence

**Examiners assess**:
- Do you ask about cultural preferences?
- Do you adapt your approach?
- Do you involve family appropriately?
- Do you offer interpreter?
- Do you show cultural humility?
- Do you avoid stereotyping while being culturally aware?

### Cultural Safety Definition

**Cultural safety** means:
- Acknowledging power imbalances
- Recognizing your own cultural lens
- Providing care that doesn't diminish, demean, or disempower people from other cultures
- Understanding that culture shapes how people experience illness, death, and grief

---

## THE GOLDEN RULE

**NEVER ASSUME. ALWAYS ASK.**

❌ **Wrong**: "You're Chinese, so you probably want your family to make medical decisions."

✅ **Right**: "Different people have different preferences about family involvement in medical decisions. What's your preference?"

### The Key Questions to Ask EVERY Patient

**1. Family Involvement**:
- "Some people like to have family members involved in health decisions. Others prefer to receive information alone first. What's your preference?"

**2. Information Disclosure**:
- "Some people want to know all the details about their diagnosis. Others prefer to know just the basics. What feels right for you?"

**3. Decision-Making**:
- "Who would you like to be involved in making decisions about your treatment?"

**4. Spiritual/Cultural Needs**:
- "Do you have any cultural or religious needs we should know about?"
- "Is there anyone from your faith community you'd like us to contact?"

**5. Language**:
- "What language are you most comfortable speaking? Would you like an interpreter?"

**6. End-of-Life (if relevant)**:
- "Different cultures have different practices around death and dying. Are there any specific wishes you'd like us to know about?"

### Why This Approach Works

- ✅ Respects individual autonomy
- ✅ Avoids stereotyping
- ✅ Shows cultural humility
- ✅ Allows patient to guide you
- ✅ Meets AMC OSCE cultural safety criteria

## AUSTRALIAN ANGLO-CELTIC APPROACH

### The "Baseline" in Australian Healthcare

Western biomedical culture (dominant in Australia) has specific values:
- **Individualism**: Patient is decision-maker
- **Autonomy**: Patient's right to know and choose
- **Truth-telling**: Direct disclosure to patient
- **Patient-centered**: Focus on individual, not family
- **Privacy**: Medical information is private
- **Nuclear family**: Spouse and children, not extended family

**This is the approach taught in Australian medical school and assumed in OSCE.**

**HOWEVER**: This is NOT universal. Many cultures have different values.

### Typical Anglo-Australian Patient Preferences

**Information Disclosure**:
- Expects direct, honest disclosure
- "Tell it to me straight, doc"
- Wants details
- Wants to know prognosis, even if poor

**Decision-Making**:
- Individual decision-maker
- May consult spouse/partner
- Expects doctor to present options, patient chooses

**Family Involvement**:
- Often wants to tell family themselves
- May want partner present, but decides alone
- Nuclear family focus (spouse, children)

**Emotional Expression**:
- Generally moderate (crying common, wailing unusual)
- "Stiff upper lip" culture in older generation
- Younger generation more emotionally expressive

**Religion**:
- Declining religiosity
- May want chaplain, but many are secular
- Don't assume Christian

**Example Breaking Bad News**:
*"Mrs Smith, I'm afraid the test results show cancer. I know that's very difficult to hear. Let me explain what this means and what our treatment options are. You can take time to think about it and discuss with your family."*

## INDIGENOUS AUSTRALIAN PATIENTS

### Cultural Context

**Recognition**: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are the Traditional Owners of the land
**Population**: 3.8% of Australian population
**Cultural Diversity**: 250+ distinct language groups; not a monolith
**Historical Trauma**: Stolen Generations, institutional racism, ongoing health disparities
**Health Stats**: Life expectancy 8-10 years lower than non-Indigenous Australians

### Key Cultural Considerations in Breaking Bad News

#### 1. **HISTORICAL TRAUMA WITH HEALTHCARE SYSTEM**

**Context**:
- Ongoing institutional racism
- Medical experimentation on Indigenous people
- Forced removal of children
- Deep mistrust of institutions

**Your Approach**:
- Acknowledge this history implicitly through extra care, time, respect
- Never be dismissive
- Build trust first
- Don't rush

**What to Say**:
- ✅ "I want to make sure you have all the information and support you need. Please let me know if anything I say isn't clear."
- ✅ "Who would you like to have with you for this conversation?"

#### 2. **COLLECTIVE CULTURE - FAMILY-CENTERED**

**Preference**:
- Many Indigenous patients prefer family present
- Extended family (not just nuclear)
- Community involvement
- Family may want to protect patient from bad news

**Your Approach**:
- **ALWAYS ask**: "Who would you like to have with you when we discuss your test results?"
- Large family groups may attend - this is normal and should be accommodated
- Don't ask them to "choose just one person"

**Setting**:
- Larger room may be needed
- Family meeting approach
- Aunties, uncles, cousins may all be "immediate family"

#### 3. **ABORIGINAL LIAISON OFFICER**

**CRITICAL**: Offer Aboriginal Liaison Officer involvement

**What to Say**:
- "We have an Aboriginal Liaison Officer who can support you through this. Would you like me to contact them?"

**Role of ALO**:
- Cultural bridge
- Advocate
- Explains medical concepts in culturally appropriate way
- Helps navigate healthcare system
- Connects to community services

#### 4. **SORRY BUSINESS (Grief Protocols)**

**If breaking news of death**:
- "Sorry Business" = cultural protocols around death and mourning
- Complex, varies by nation/language group
- May include:
  - Not saying deceased's name
  - Not showing deceased's image
  - Community ceremonies
  - Extended family/community gathering
  - Specific burial requirements

**Your Approach**:
- "Are there any cultural protocols we should follow?"
- "Would you like to speak with the Aboriginal Liaison Officer about Sorry Business?"
- Defer to family and ALO on specific practices

**Practical**:
- Remove photos of deceased from room if family requests
- Don't say deceased's name after being told not to
- Allow large family gatherings
- Flexible visiting hours

#### 5. **COMMUNICATION STYLE**

**Indirect Communication**:
- Direct eye contact can be seen as disrespectful (especially to Elders)
- Silence is normal - don't rush to fill it
- Storytelling approach common
- May take time to get to the point

**Your Approach**:
- Soften eye contact - don't stare directly
- Allow long silences
- Don't rush
- Listen to stories - they're relevant even if indirect

#### 6. **CONCEPT OF ILLNESS AND HEALING**

**Holistic View**:
- Health is physical, emotional, spiritual, cultural, social
- Connection to Country (land) is health
- Traditional healing may be used alongside Western medicine

**Your Approach**:
- "Are you using any traditional medicines or seeing a traditional healer?"
- Don't dismiss traditional healing
- ✅ "You can do both - traditional healing and our treatment can work together."
- ❌ Don't say: "That traditional medicine doesn't work."

#### 7. **CONSENT AND DECISION-MAKING**

**Family/Community Decision-Making Common**:
- Patient may want to consult Elders, family, community
- Individual autonomy less emphasized
- Taking time to decide is important

**Your Approach**:
- "Take the time you need to discuss this with your family and community."
- "Would you like to have a family meeting where we can all discuss the options together?"
- Don't push for immediate decision

#### 8. **PRACTICAL BARRIERS**

**Common Issues**:
- May live in remote/regional areas - long distance to travel
- May have financial barriers
- May have large families to care for
- May have competing cultural obligations
- May have limited health literacy (not lack of intelligence - lack of access to education)

**Your Approach**:
- Social work referral essential
- Patient Transport Assistance Scheme (PTAS)
- Accommodation assistance
- Financial support
- Simple language, visual aids

### Example Breaking Bad News to Indigenous Patient

*"Thank you for coming in, [Name]. Before we talk about your test results, who would you like to have with you? Your family are welcome to join us."*

*[Family enters, or patient says they're okay alone]*

*"We have an Aboriginal Liaison Officer, [Name], who can support you through this. Would you like me to ask them to join us?"*

*"I need to talk to you about your test results. [Pause] The results show that you have [diagnosis]. [Pause] I know this is very hard to hear."*

*[Allow silence, observe reaction, involve family as appropriate]*

*"Do you have any cultural needs or practices that are important to you that we should know about?"*

*"There's no rush to make decisions today. You might want to talk to your family, your community, your Elders. Take the time you need."*

### OSCE Tips for Indigenous Patient Scenarios

**Examiner is assessing**:
- ✅ Did you offer Aboriginal Liaison Officer?
- ✅ Did you ask about family involvement?
- ✅ Did you show cultural safety and respect?
- ✅ Did you avoid stereotyping?
- ✅ Did you use appropriate communication style?
- ✅ Did you allow time and family decision-making?

## CHINESE AND EAST ASIAN CULTURES

### Cultural Context

**Populations in Australia**:
- Chinese: 1.4 million (5.6% of population)
- Includes: Mainland Chinese, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singaporean Chinese
- Plus Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese
- Wide diversity within "East Asian" category

**DO NOT assume all East Asians are the same.**

### Key Cultural Considerations

#### 1. **FAMILY PROTECTION / DISCLOSURE DILEMMA**

**Traditional Value**:
- Protecting patient from bad news
- Family may want to know diagnosis BEFORE patient
- "If we tell mother she has cancer, she will give up hope and die faster"
- Benevolent deception

**Australian Legal/Ethical Standard**:
- Patient has right to know their diagnosis
- Can't disclose to family without patient consent
- Patient autonomy is paramount

**THE CONFLICT**:

Family says: "Don't tell my mother she has cancer. We'll tell her it's an infection."

You must: Tell the patient (Australian law), but do so culturally sensitively

**How to Handle**:

**Step 1**: Listen to family concern
- "I understand you're concerned about how your mother will cope with this news."
- "In your culture, protecting family from bad news is a way of showing love."

**Step 2**: Explain Australian medical ethics
- "In Australia, doctors have a legal and ethical obligation to tell patients their diagnosis."
- "Your mother has the right to know what's happening in her own body."
- "We can't withhold her diagnosis from her."

**Step 3**: Offer compromise
- "What I can do is discuss WITH your mother how much information she wants."
- "Some patients want all the details. Others prefer to know just the basics."
- "We can let HER decide how much she wants to know."
- "Would you like to be present when I talk to her?"

**Step 4**: Gentle disclosure with family present
- *In consultation with patient AND family*:
- "Mrs Chen, your tests show an abnormality that needs treatment. How much detail would you like me to go into?"
- *Patient may say*: "Just tell my family, they'll decide."
- *You respond*: "I want to make sure you understand enough to be comfortable with the treatment plan. Let me explain the basics, and your family can help you with decisions."

**What to Say to Family Who Insist**:
- ✅ "I hear your concern for your mother. In Australia, I have a legal obligation to tell her the diagnosis. What I can do is involve you in the conversation and let her decide how much detail she wants."
- ❌ "It's Australian law, I have to tell her." (Too blunt, dismissive)

#### 2. **FAMILY-CENTERED DECISION-MAKING**

**Preference**:
- Collective decision-making
- Children make decisions for elderly parents
- Husband may speak for wife (especially older generation)
- Family consensus important

**Your Approach**:
- Include family (with patient consent)
- "Who would you like to be involved in making decisions about your treatment?"
- Family meetings common
- Allow time for family discussion

**Balance**:
- Ensure patient's voice is heard
- Private conversation with patient alone (make sure they agree, not just deferring)

#### 3. **EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION**

**Traditional Style**:
- Reserved emotional expression (especially older generation)
- Stoicism valued
- "Saving face" - maintaining dignity
- May not cry in front of doctor

**Your Approach**:
- Don't interpret lack of visible emotion as "not caring" or "not understanding"
- Respect reserve
- Offer privacy: "Would you like a moment alone?"

#### 4. **CONCEPT OF BALANCE AND HARMONY**

**Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**:
- Balance of yin/yang, hot/cold, qi
- May use TCM alongside Western medicine
- May want to consult TCM practitioner

**Your Approach**:
- "Are you using any traditional Chinese medicine?"
- ✅ "You can continue TCM alongside our treatment. Please let me know what you're taking so I can check for interactions."
- ❌ Don't dismiss: "That doesn't work."

#### 5. **NUMBERS AND SYMBOLISM**

**Cultural Belief**:
- Number 4 = bad luck (sounds like "death" in Mandarin)
- Some patients may refuse room number 4, bed 4
- Number 8 = good luck

**Your Approach**:
- If patient requests room change away from number 4, accommodate if possible
- Don't dismiss as "superstition"

#### 6. **END-OF-LIFE CARE**

**Traditional Beliefs**:
- Dying at home preferred
- May want to die with family present
- Ancestor worship - proper burial important
- Discussion of death may be taboo

**Your Approach**:
- Gentle approach to end-of-life discussions
- Involve family
- "What's important to you about end-of-life care?"

### Example Breaking Bad News to Chinese Patient

*"Mrs Wang, I've asked you to come in to discuss your test results. Would you like to have anyone with you - your husband or children?"*

*[Daughter says: "Doctor, I need to speak with you alone first."]* *[Outside room]: "Doctor, please don't tell my mother she has cancer. She's old, it will destroy her. Just tell us and we'll manage it."*

*"I understand you're trying to protect your mother - that shows how much you care for her. In Chinese culture, protecting family from bad news is important, and I respect that."*

*[Pause]*

*"In Australia, I have a legal obligation to tell your mother her diagnosis. But what I can do is discuss it with her in a gentle way, with you present, and let her tell me how much detail she wants to know. That way, she has information but you can support her. Would that be okay?"*

*[Back in room with patient and daughter]*:

*"Mrs Wang, your test results show something that needs treatment. I want to make sure you have the information you need. Some people want all the details, others prefer their family to know the details. What feels right for you?"*

*[Patient may say: "My daughter will handle everything." Or: "Tell me."]* *[Adapt accordingly, but ensure patient has basic understanding]*

## ISLAMIC / MIDDLE EASTERN CULTURES

### Cultural Context

**Populations in Australia**:
- 813,000 Muslims (3.2% of population)
- Includes: Lebanese, Turkish, Iranian, Iraqi, Afghan, Pakistani, Indonesian, Malaysian, Somali, Egyptian, etc.
- **Islam is a religion, not an ethnicity** - Muslims from 50+ countries
- Diverse interpretations and practices

### Key Cultural Considerations

#### 1. **ISLAMIC CONCEPT OF ILLNESS AND DEATH**

**Core Beliefs**:
- "Inshallah" (If God wills) - God's will is supreme
- Illness is a test from Allah
- Death is transition to afterlife
- Life and death are predetermined by Allah

**Implication for Breaking Bad News**:
- Patient may say "It is Allah's will" - not fatalism, but acceptance
- Faith provides comfort and framework for understanding suffering

**Your Approach**:
- Respect religious framework
- Don't dismiss as "fatalistic"
- ✅ "I understand your faith is important to you. Many people find strength in their faith during difficult times."
- Work within their framework: "While this is Allah's will, I also believe Allah works through medicine and doctors. Would you be willing to try treatment?"

#### 2. **FAMILY INVOLVEMENT**

**Preference**:
- Family-centered (not individual-centered)
- Husband/eldest son often spokesperson
- Large extended family involvement
- Community/mosque involvement

**Your Approach**:
- Ask patient: "Who would you like involved in this conversation?"
- Accommodate large family groups
- Respect family hierarchy

#### 3. **GENDER CONSIDERATIONS**

**Traditional Practice** (Varies by individual):
- Female patient may prefer female doctor
- Male patient may prefer male doctor
- Husband may need to be present for female patient consultation
- Physical examination by opposite sex may be uncomfortable

**Your Approach - ALWAYS ASK**:
- "Would you prefer a female doctor?" (if you're male and patient is female)
- "Are you comfortable with me examining you, or would you prefer a female doctor?" (**Chaperone essential**)
- If female patient's husband is present: *To patient directly*: "Are you comfortable discussing this with your husband present, or would you like privacy?"

#### 4. **MODESTY**

**Important**:
- Modesty highly valued in Islam
- Hijab (headscarf) should never be removed without permission and necessity
- Body should be covered as much as possible during examination
- Female patient may be uncomfortable with male doctor even for history-taking

**Your Approach**:
- Respect hijab - don't ask patient to remove unless medically necessary
- During physical examination: "I'll make sure you're covered as much as possible."
- Close door, draw curtain

#### 5. **RAMADAN CONSIDERATIONS**

**During Ramadan** (Islamic holy month):
- Fasting from dawn to sunset (no food, water, medications)
- Sick, pregnant, traveling are exempt - but may still choose to fast
- Medications during fasting hours may be refused

**Your Approach**:
- "I understand you may be observing Ramadan. We can adjust medication times if needed."
- "Islamic law says sick people don't have to fast. Would you like to discuss this with an imam?"
- Don't assume they'll break fast for medication - discuss options

#### 6. **END-OF-LIFE CARE**

**Islamic Practices**:
- Patient should face Mecca if possible
- Quran recitation at bedside
- Family should be present
- Confession of faith (Shahada) said before death
- Body should not be left alone after death
- Burial should be within 24 hours if possible
- No autopsy (unless legally required - e.g., coroner's case)
- No cremation (burial only)
- Body should be washed by family member of same sex

**Your Approach - If Patient Dying**:
- "Are there any religious practices important to you that we should know about?"
- "Would you like us to contact an imam?"
- "Would you like the bed positioned to face Mecca?"
- Allow family to stay overnight
- After death: "Are there any Islamic burial requirements we should follow?"

**Coroner Cases**:
- If autopsy required by law, explain this sensitively
- "I know in Islam, autopsy is not preferred. Unfortunately, because of [sudden death / unknown cause], the Coroner requires an autopsy by law. I'm very sorry."

#### 7. **CONCEPT OF HOPE**

**Never remove hope** - This is culturally important

- Even with terminal diagnosis, frame with hope
- ✅ "We will do everything possible. With treatment and Allah's will, we hope for the best."
- ❌ "There's no hope" (culturally inappropriate)

### Example Breaking Bad News to Muslim Patient

*"Assalamu alaykum (Peace be upon you), Mr Hassan. Thank you for coming in."*

*"I've received the results of your tests. Before we discuss them, who would you like to have with you? Your wife or family are welcome."*

*[Family present or patient alone, as they prefer]*

*"The tests show that you have [diagnosis]. I know this is difficult to hear."*

*[Patient may say: "It is Allah's will."]*

*"I understand your faith is important to you, and many people find strength in their faith during difficult times like this. While this is in Allah's hands, I also believe that Allah works through medicine and treatment. There are treatments available that we can try, Inshallah (God willing)."*

*"Would you like to speak with an imam for spiritual support?"*

*"Let's discuss the treatment options and make a plan, with Allah's help."*

### OSCE Tips

- ✅ Use Islamic greeting if you know it (shows respect)
- ✅ Offer imam/chaplain
- ✅ Respect modesty and gender preferences
- ✅ Work within "Inshallah" framework, don't fight it
- ✅ Chaperone for opposite-sex examination
- ✅ Never say "there's no hope"

## THE INDIVIDUAL VS THE COLLECTIVE

### Fundamental Cultural Difference

**Western/Anglo-Australian**:
- Individual is decision-making unit
- "Patient autonomy" is supreme value
- Privacy of medical information
- Patient decides, possibly consults family

**Many Other Cultures**:
- Family/community is decision-making unit
- Collective good > individual autonomy
- Medical information shared with family
- Family decides, patient accepts

### Australian Medical Law vs Cultural Values

**Australian Law**:
- Patient must consent to their own treatment
- Competent adult decides for themselves
- Can't disclose to family without patient permission
- Patient autonomy is legally protected

**Cultural Value**:
- Family should decide
- Patient may want to defer to family
- Family should protect patient from bad news

### How to Navigate This

**1. Start with patient's preference**:
- "Different people have different preferences. Some people like to make their own medical decisions. Others prefer family to be involved or even to make decisions. What feels right for you?"

**2. If patient says "My family will decide"**:
- ✅ Accept this as their choice
- But ensure patient has basic understanding
- "That's fine. I'll discuss options with your family. But I do need to make sure YOU understand the basics so you can feel comfortable with the plan. Is that okay?"

**3. Balance legal requirement with cultural sensitivity**:
- You must tell patient their diagnosis (law)
- You can do so gently, with family present, allowing family to be involved in decisions
- Patient can choose to have family make decisions (that's their autonomy)

**4. Private check-in with patient**:
- Ensure patient genuinely wants family involvement vs feeling pressured
- "I'd like to speak with you alone briefly, just to make sure you're comfortable with everything. Is that okay?"
- If patient is being coerced by family, this is opportunity to identify it

## INTERPRETER USE ACROSS CULTURES

### CRITICAL SKILL for AMC OSCE

**When to Use Interpreter**:
- ✅ ALWAYS offer if patient's English is limited
- Even if family speaks English, patient may not
- Professional interpreter (not family) for serious news

**How to Use Interpreter** (See main Communication document for full detail):

**1. SPEAK TO PATIENT, NOT INTERPRETER**:
- ❌ "Ask her where the pain is."
- ✅ "Where is your pain?" *[looking at patient]*

**2. USE FIRST PERSON**:
- ❌ "Tell him I'm going to examine him."
- ✅ "I'm going to examine you." *[to patient]*

**3. SHORT SENTENCES**:
- Pause after each sentence for interpretation
- Don't ramble

**4. CHECK UNDERSTANDING**:
- "Can you tell me what you've understood?"

**5. OBSERVE PATIENT**:
- Watch their body language, facial expression
- They're speaking, even if you don't understand words

**6. CULTURAL INTERPRETER**:
- Interpreter can provide cultural context
- "Is there a culturally appropriate way to explain this?"

### Family as Interpreter - When NOT to Use

**❌ Don't use family member as interpreter for**:
- Breaking bad news
- Terminal diagnosis
- Serious illness
- Sensitive topics (sexual health, mental health, domestic violence)

**Why**:
- Family may filter information (protect patient)
- Family may not translate accurately (emotional)
- Family's grief interferes
- Confidentiality issues

**✅ CAN use family for**:
- Minor issues
- If professional interpreter not available and issue is non-urgent
- If patient insists

## COMMON IMG MISTAKES IN CULTURAL SAFETY

### Mistakes that Fail OSCE

**❌ MISTAKE 1: Stereotyping**
- "You're Chinese, so you probably want your family to make decisions."
- "Muslims don't want female doctors."
- **Why it fails**: Assumes all people from culture are identical
- **Fix**: ASK individual patient their preference

**❌ MISTAKE 2: Not Asking About Cultural Needs**
- Delivering news without asking about family involvement, cultural practices
- **Why it fails**: Doesn't show cultural awareness
- **Fix**: ALWAYS ask: "Do you have any cultural or religious needs?"

**❌ MISTAKE 3: Not Offering Interpreter**
- Proceeding in English when patient clearly struggling
- **Why it fails**: Doesn't ensure informed consent
- **Fix**: "Would you like an interpreter?"

**❌ MISTAKE 4: Speaking to Interpreter Instead of Patient**
- Looking at interpreter, saying "Tell her..."
- **Why it fails**: Excludes patient from own conversation
- **Fix**: Speak TO patient, not about patient

**❌ MISTAKE 5: Dismissing Traditional Medicine**
- "That herbal medicine doesn't work."
- **Why it fails**: Disrespectful, damages rapport
- **Fix**: "You can use both. Please tell me what you're taking so I can check for interactions."

**❌ MISTAKE 6: Not Accommodating Large Families**
- "Only one visitor allowed."
- **Why it fails**: Culturally insensitive
- **Fix**: Accommodate large families when possible

**❌ MISTAKE 7: Pushing Individual Autonomy Culturally Inappropriately**
- "You need to make your own decision, not let your family decide."
- **Why it fails**: Imposes Western values
- **Fix**: Respect patient's choice to involve family

**❌ MISTAKE 8: Ignoring Gender Preferences**
- Male doctor examining female Muslim patient without asking
- **Why it fails**: Violates modesty/religious values
- **Fix**: "Are you comfortable with me, or would you prefer a female doctor?"

**❌ MISTAKE 9: Not Offering Chaplain/Religious Leader**
- **Why it fails**: Doesn't address spiritual needs
- **Fix**: "Would you like to speak with a chaplain/imam/priest?"

**❌ MISTAKE 10: Cultural Assumption Based on Appearance**
- Assuming someone is Muslim because they "look Middle Eastern"
- Assuming someone is Buddhist because they're Asian
- **Why it fails**: Stereotyping, often wrong
- **Fix**: ASK, don't assume

## FINAL SUMMARY

### The Universal Approach to Cultural Safety in Breaking Bad News

**1. ASK, Don't Assume**:
- "Who would you like involved in this conversation?"
- "How much detail would you like me to go into?"
- "Do you have any cultural or religious needs?"

**2. Respect Individual Within Culture**:
- Cultural awareness + individual flexibility
- Don't stereotype

**3. Offer Resources**:
- Interpreter (if needed)
- Chaplain/religious leader (all faiths)
- Aboriginal Liaison Officer (Indigenous patients)
- Social work (practical support)

**4. Adapt Your Approach**:
- Some patients want direct truth → give it
- Some patients want family involved → involve them
- Some patients want gentle approach → gentle
- Follow patient's lead

**5. Cultural Humility**:
- You don't know everything about every culture
- It's okay to say: "I want to be respectful of your culture. Please tell me if there's anything I should know."
- Learn from patient

**6. Balance Law and Culture**:
- Australian law requires patient be informed
- But HOW you inform can be culturally adapted
- Gentle disclosure with family present = respects both law and culture

---

**Remember: Cultural competence is a journey, not a destination. You'll make mistakes. Apologize, learn, adapt. What matters is respect, humility, and genuine effort to provide culturally safe care.**
