## Dr. Amir Soufi's Approach Applied to Capacity Assessment

### Core Principle: SYSTEMATIC ASSESSMENT with CLEAR DOCUMENTATION

**Traditional Approach (Inadequate)**:
- Vague statement: "Patient lacks capacity"
- No structured assessment
- Assumption that psychiatric diagnosis = lack of capacity
- Poor documentation

**Dr. Soufi's Systematic Approach**:

1. **DECISION-SPECIFIC**: Capacity is assessed for a **SPECIFIC decision** (not global)
   - Patient may have capacity for some decisions but not others
   - Example: Patient may have capacity to consent to blood test but not to discharge against medical advice

2. **TIME-SPECIFIC**: Capacity can **fluctuate**
   - Patient may lack capacity now (acute psychosis, intoxication, delirium) but regain it later
   - Reassess as clinical state changes

3. **FOUR-ELEMENT FRAMEWORK** (Structured Assessment):
   - **U**nderstand information relevant to decision
   - **R**etain information long enough to make decision
   - **U**se and **W**eigh information to make decision
   - **C**ommunicate decision
   - **Mnemonic: U-R-U-W-C**

4. **ASSUME CAPACITY** unless proven otherwise
   - Everyone (including psychiatric patients) assumed to have capacity until assessment demonstrates otherwise
   - Mental illness ≠ automatic lack of capacity

5. **MAXIMIZE CAPACITY**: Support patient to have capacity
   - Optimize timing (when patient not acutely unwell)
   - Optimize environment (quiet, supportive)
   - Optimize communication (simple language, visual aids, interpreter)
   - Optimize treatment (treat delirium, pain, anxiety)

6. **DOCUMENT THOROUGHLY**: Medicolegal protection
   - What decision is being assessed
   - All four elements assessed with specific evidence
   - Conclusion: Has capacity / Lacks capacity (with rationale)

**Example**:
- **Decision**: Consent to voluntary psychiatric admission
- **Assessment**:
  - Understand: "Can you tell me why we've recommended admission?" → Patient: "You think I'm depressed and might hurt myself"✓
  - Retain: Able to recall information after 5 minutes ✓
  - Use/Weigh: "What are the pros and cons of admission?" → Patient: "Pros: Get help, be safe. Cons: Miss work, worried about stigma. But I understand I need help." ✓
  - Communicate: Verbally communicates decision ✓
- **Conclusion**: Patient **HAS capacity** to consent to voluntary admission

## 1. MENTAL CAPACITY ASSESSMENT

### What is Mental Capacity?

**Capacity (Mental Capacity)**: The ability to make a decision

**Key Principles**:

1. **Assume capacity** unless proven otherwise
2. **Decision-specific**: Assessed for each specific decision (not global)
3. **Time-specific**: Can fluctuate (reassess as clinical state changes)
4. **Maximize capacity**: Take steps to support patient to have capacity
5. **Mental illness ≠ lack of capacity**: Many patients with psychiatric illness have capacity

---

### Four-Element Framework for Capacity Assessment

**U-R-U-W-C Mnemonic**:

1. **U**nderstand
2. **R**etain
3. **U**se and **W**eigh
4. **C**ommunicate

---

#### Element 1: UNDERSTAND

**Can the patient understand information relevant to the decision?**

**How to assess**:
- Explain the information (diagnosis, treatment options, risks/benefits, alternatives)
- Ask patient to explain back in their own words

**Questions**:
- "Can you tell me what I've just explained?"
- "What is your understanding of your condition?"
- "What is this treatment for?"

**Example**:
- Doctor: "You have pneumonia, a lung infection. We recommend antibiotics."
- Doctor: "Can you tell me what I've just said?"
- Patient: "I have an infection in my lungs. You want to give me antibiotics to treat it." ✓ Understands

**Factors that impair understanding**:
- Cognitive impairment (dementia, intellectual disability, delirium)
- Psychosis (if delusions interfere with understanding)
- Language barrier (needs interpreter)
- Poor explanation by doctor (use simple language, avoid jargon)

---

#### Element 2: RETAIN

**Can the patient retain information long enough to make a decision?**

**How to assess**:
- After explaining, wait a few minutes
- Ask patient to recall the information

**Questions**:
- "Can you tell me again what we discussed?"

**Note**:
- Patient does NOT need to retain information indefinitely
- Only needs to retain long enough to make the decision
- Severe memory impairment (advanced dementia, Korsakoff syndrome) may prevent retention

**Example**:
- Doctor explains treatment
- 5 minutes later: "Can you tell me what we discussed about your treatment?"
- Patient: "You said I need antibiotics for my lung infection." ✓ Retains

---

#### Element 3: USE and WEIGH

**Can the patient use and weigh information to make a decision?**

**This is the most complex element**:
- Can patient appreciate how information applies to them?
- Can patient weigh pros and cons?
- Can patient arrive at a decision using reasoning?

**How to assess**:
- Ask patient to discuss pros and cons of options
- Ask how information applies to their situation
- Observe reasoning process

**Questions**:
- "What are the benefits of this treatment?"
- "What are the risks or downsides?"
- "What might happen if you don't have this treatment?"
- "How do you feel about these options?"
- "How did you arrive at your decision?"

**Example**:
- Doctor: "What are the pros and cons of taking antidepressants?"
- Patient: "Pros: Might help my depression, improve my mood. Cons: Side effects like nausea, sexual dysfunction. But I think the benefits outweigh the risks because my depression is really affecting my life." ✓ Uses and weighs

**Factors that impair use/weigh**:
- **Severe depression** (hopelessness prevents weighing benefits: "Nothing will help")
- **Delusions** (patient bases decision on false belief)
- **Severe anxiety** (unable to process information rationally)
- **Mania** (impulsive, lacks consideration of consequences)

---

#### Element 4: COMMUNICATE

**Can the patient communicate their decision?**

**How to assess**:
- Can patient express choice by any means (verbal, written, gesture, communication aid)?

**Note**:
- Communication difficulty (aphasia, intubation, locked-in syndrome) ≠ lack of capacity
- Must provide alternative means of communication (writing, picture boards, eye blinks for yes/no)

**Example**:
- Patient with stroke and aphasia
- Uses picture board to point to "YES" for surgery ✓ Communicates

**RARELY the issue** in capacity assessment (unless severe impairment of consciousness)

---

### Capacity Assessment Documentation Template

**DECISION BEING ASSESSED**: [Specific decision, e.g., "Consent to voluntary psychiatric admission"]

**CAPACITY ASSESSMENT**:

**1. Understand**:
- Information provided: [Diagnosis, treatment options, risks/benefits]
- Assessment: Patient able to explain back: [Quote patient's words]
- **Conclusion**: Able ✓ / Unable to understand

**2. Retain**:
- Assessment: Patient able to recall information after [time interval]
- **Conclusion**: Able ✓ / Unable to retain

**3. Use and Weigh**:
- Assessment: Patient able to discuss pros/cons: [Quote patient's reasoning]
- Factors impairing use/weigh: [Delusions, severe depression, mania, etc.]
- **Conclusion**: Able ✓ / Unable to use and weigh

**4. Communicate**:
- Assessment: Patient able to communicate decision by [verbal/written/gesture]
- **Conclusion**: Able ✓ / Unable to communicate

**OVERALL CONCLUSION**:
- Patient **HAS capacity** / **LACKS capacity** for [specific decision]
- **Rationale**: [Brief summary of why, referencing specific elements]

**PLAN**:
- If has capacity: Respect patient's decision (even if you disagree)
- If lacks capacity: Proceed in patient's best interests, involve substitute decision-maker if available

**Reassessment**: [If capacity may fluctuate, plan for reassessment]

### Common Scenarios and Capacity

#### Scenario 1: Refusing Treatment in Depression

**Case**: 55-year-old woman with severe depression refuses antidepressants

**Capacity Assessment**:
- **Understand**: ✓ "You think I have depression and antidepressants might help"
- **Retain**: ✓ Able to recall
- **Use/Weigh**: ✗ "Nothing will help, I'm beyond help, there's no point" (Hopelessness from depression prevents weighing potential benefits)
- **Communicate**: ✓ "I don't want medication"

**Conclusion**: **LACKS capacity** for this decision (unable to use and weigh due to severe depression with hopelessness)

**Plan**: Treat in patient's best interests (start antidepressant), reassess capacity as depression improves

---

#### Scenario 2: Refusing Admission in Psychosis

**Case**: 28-year-old man with paranoid delusions refuses psychiatric admission

**Capacity Assessment**:
- **Understand**: ✗ "You're part of the conspiracy to imprison me. There's nothing wrong with me." (Delusions interfere with understanding that he is unwell)
- **Retain**: Cannot assess (doesn't understand information)
- **Use/Weigh**: ✗ Decision based on delusional beliefs (government conspiracy)
- **Communicate**: ✓ "I'm not staying here"

**Conclusion**: **LACKS capacity** for this decision (unable to understand due to delusions that he is unwell)

**Plan**: Involuntary admission under Mental Health Act (Schedule 1)

---

#### Scenario 3: Discharge Against Medical Advice - Has Capacity

**Case**: 35-year-old woman with mild depression wants to discharge against medical advice

**Capacity Assessment**:
- **Understand**: ✓ "I know you think I should stay, and I understand there's a risk I might get worse at home"
- **Retain**: ✓ Able to recall
- **Use/Weigh**: ✓ "I know the risks, but I have support at home from my husband. I'll see my GP tomorrow. I understand I can come back if I get worse. I just want to be at home with my kids."
- **Communicate**: ✓ "I want to leave"

**Conclusion**: **HAS capacity** for this decision (all four elements met)

**Plan**: **Respect patient's decision** even though you disagree. Document thoroughly. Provide safety plan (GP appointment, crisis numbers, return if worsens). Document "patient has capacity, declines admission, risks explained, safety plan provided, patient agrees to follow-up."

---

### Maximizing Capacity (Optimize Before Assessing)

**Before concluding patient lacks capacity, maximize their ability to have capacity**:

1. **Optimize timing**:
   - Avoid assessing when patient acutely unwell (delirium, intoxication, post-ictal)
   - Reassess when patient more settled
   - Consider time of day (some patients better in morning)

2. **Optimize environment**:
   - Quiet, private space (reduce distractions)
   - Familiar person present (family member for reassurance)
   - Remove stressors

3. **Optimize communication**:
   - **Simple language** (avoid medical jargon)
   - **Visual aids** (diagrams, pictures, written information)
   - **Interpreter** if language barrier
   - **Communication aids** if aphasia, hearing impairment
   - Check understanding regularly ("Can you tell me what I've just explained?")

4. **Optimize medical treatment**:
   - **Treat delirium** (common reversible cause of impaired capacity)
   - **Treat pain** (impairs concentration)
   - **Treat acute psychosis/mania** (if safe to do so, capacity may improve)

**Example**:
- Patient with delirium (UTI, new confusion) → Treat UTI, wait 24-48 hours → Reassess capacity when delirium resolved

## 2. MENTAL HEALTH ACT NSW 2007

### Overview

**Mental Health Act NSW 2007**: Legislation governing involuntary assessment and treatment of mental illness in New South Wales

**Key Principles**:
- Least restrictive care
- Voluntary treatment preferred
- Involuntary treatment only when criteria met
- Patients' rights protected
- Tribunal review

---

### Criteria for Involuntary Treatment (Schedule 1)

**ALL THREE criteria must be met**:

1. **Mental illness** (defined in Act)
2. **Risk of serious harm** to self or others, OR serious deterioration
3. **Involuntary treatment necessary** (no less restrictive alternative)

Let's explore each:

---

#### Criterion 1: Mental Illness (Defined in Mental Health Act)

**Mental illness** means:
- Condition that seriously impairs mental functioning
- Characterized by disturbance of:
  - Thought
  - Mood
  - Perception
  - Memory
  - **OR** behavior

**Includes**:
- Schizophrenia, psychotic disorders
- Major depressive disorder
- Bipolar disorder
- Severe anxiety disorders (if seriously impairing)

**EXCLUDES** (cannot use Mental Health Act for):
- **Substance intoxication alone** (cannot schedule someone purely for being intoxicated)
  - Exception: If intoxication reveals underlying mental illness
- **Personality disorder alone** (unless co-occurring mental illness)
- **Intellectual disability alone**
- **Developmental disorder alone**

---

#### Criterion 2: Risk of Serious Harm

**A. Risk of serious harm to self OR others**:
- **Suicide risk** (active ideation with plan/intent, previous attempts)
- **Self-harm risk** (severe, recurrent)
- **Violence risk** (to others)
- **Self-neglect** (not eating, drinking, placing self in danger)

**OR**

**B. Risk of serious deterioration** in patient's condition if not treated

**"Serious" = significant, not trivial**

---

#### Criterion 3: Involuntary Treatment Necessary

**No less restrictive alternative available**

**Considerations**:
- Voluntary admission not possible (patient refuses, lacks insight)
- Community treatment insufficient (patient too unwell)
- Risk cannot be managed otherwise

---

### Mental Health Act Forms

#### Form 1 (Medical Practitioner - 12 hours)

**Who can complete**: ANY medical practitioner (GP, ED doctor, psychiatrist)

**Criteria**: Reasonable grounds to believe person is mentally ill AND requires immediate assessment/treatment

**Duration**: Up to **12 hours** (patient can be detained for assessment)

**Purpose**: Allows time for psychiatric assessment

**Process**:
1. Medical officer completes Form 1
2. Patient detained in hospital (usually ED or psychiatric unit)
3. Psychiatrist must assess within 12 hours
4. Psychiatrist decides: Voluntary admission / Schedule 1 (involuntary) / Discharge

**Documentation**:
- Mental state examination
- Reason for Form 1 (mental illness, risk of serious harm)
- "Form 1 completed due to [psychotic symptoms, suicide risk, etc.]. Patient detained for psychiatric assessment."

---

#### Schedule 1 (Psychiatrist - up to 3 months)

**Who can complete**: **ONLY psychiatrist** (not other medical practitioners)

**Criteria**: ALL three criteria met (mental illness, risk of serious harm, involuntary treatment necessary)

**Duration**: Up to **3 months** initially (can be renewed)

**Process**:
1. Psychiatrist assesses patient (may be after Form 1, or directly)
2. If criteria met, completes Schedule 1
3. Patient becomes **involuntary patient**
4. **Mental Health Review Tribunal** must review within 21 days

**Involuntary patient**:
- Can be treated without consent (medication, ECT with Tribunal approval)
- Cannot leave hospital (can be detained, brought back if absconds)
- Rights: Access to legal representation, Tribunal review, second opinion

---

#### Community Treatment Order (CTO)

**Purpose**: Involuntary treatment in the **community** (not hospital)

**Who can make**: Psychiatrist (authorized or staff specialist)

**Duration**: Up to 6 months initially (renewable up to 12 months)

**Criteria**: Same as Schedule 1, but can be managed in community with conditions

**Conditions** (must be followed):
- Attend appointments with psychiatrist, GP
- Take prescribed medication
- Reside at specified address
- Abstain from drugs/alcohol (if relevant)

**If patient breaches CTO**: Can be brought to hospital for assessment, may be admitted involuntarily

**Benefit**: Less restrictive than hospital admission, supports community living with treatment adherence

---

### Mental Health Review Tribunal

**Independent statutory body** that reviews involuntary patients

**Reviews**:
- Every involuntary patient within **21 days** of Schedule 1
- Then at regular intervals (at least every 3 months)
- Patient can request review

**Tribunal panel**:
- Lawyer (presiding officer)
- Psychiatrist
- Lay person

**Tribunal powers**:
- Affirm order (patient remains involuntary)
- Revoke order (patient becomes voluntary or discharged)
- Make CTO

**Patient rights**:
- Legal representation
- Present evidence, call witnesses
- Appeal Tribunal decision

---

## 3. CONSENT IN PSYCHIATRY

### Voluntary Patients

**Voluntary patient** = Patient admitted to psychiatric unit **with consent**

**Rights**:
- Can **refuse treatment** (if has capacity)
- Can **discharge themselves** (unless converted to involuntary)
- **Same rights as any medical patient**

**Capacity assessment**:
- If patient has capacity → Consent required for treatment
- If patient lacks capacity → Treat in best interests (or substitute decision-maker consents)

**Can voluntary patient be converted to involuntary?**
- **YES**, if criteria met (mental illness, risk of serious harm, involuntary treatment necessary)
- Patient wants to leave, but you assess they meet criteria → Complete Form 1 (up to 12 hours), call psychiatry for Schedule 1 assessment

---

### Involuntary Patients

**Involuntary patient** = Patient on Schedule 1 or CTO

**Treatment without consent**:
- **Medication** for mental illness can be given without consent
- **Restraint** if necessary (physical, chemical) - must be proportionate, last resort
- **Seclusion** if necessary (locked room) - must be reviewed regularly, documented

**ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy)**:
- **Requires Mental Health Review Tribunal approval** (even for involuntary patients)
- Exception: Emergency (life-threatening, no time for Tribunal) - senior psychiatrist can authorize

**Physical health treatment** (non-psychiatric):
- **Still requires consent** (or capacity assessment if patient lacks capacity)
- Mental Health Act does NOT authorize treatment of physical illness without consent
- Example: Involuntary psychiatric patient needs appendectomy → Still need consent (or assess capacity)

---

### Consent for ECT

**ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy)**: Treatment involving electrical stimulation of brain under general anesthesia

**Indications**:
- Severe depression (especially with psychotic features, catatonia, treatment-resistant)
- Severe mania (treatment-resistant)
- Catatonia
- Schizophrenia (treatment-resistant)

**Consent**:
- **Voluntary patient with capacity** → Written informed consent required (same as for surgery)
- **Voluntary patient lacking capacity** → Substitute decision-maker can consent (or Tribunal if no substitute)
- **Involuntary patient** → **Mental Health Review Tribunal approval required** (even if patient consents)
  - Exception: Emergency (life-threatening) - senior psychiatrist can authorize without Tribunal

**Information to provide** (informed consent):
- What ECT involves (general anesthesia, electrical stimulation)
- Why recommended (indication)
- Benefits (high efficacy for severe depression)
- Risks: Memory loss (retrograde amnesia, usually temporary), confusion post-treatment, headache, rare risks (anesthesia complications)
- Alternatives (medication, no treatment)
- Can withdraw consent at any time

---

## 4. SUBSTITUTE DECISION-MAKING AND GUARDIANSHIP

### Hierarchy of Decision-Makers (When Patient Lacks Capacity)

**When patient lacks capacity and decision needs to be made**:

**1. Enduring Guardian** (if appointed):
- Person appointed by patient (when had capacity) to make decisions if they lose capacity
- Appointed via legal document
- Can make medical, lifestyle decisions (within scope of appointment)

**2. Person Responsible** (statutory hierarchy if no guardian appointed):
- **Spouse or de facto partner**
- **Carer** (unpaid)
- **Close friend or relative**

**3. NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal (NCAT)** (if no one above available, or disagreement):
- Can appoint guardian
- Can make specific decisions

**If URGENT and no substitute decision-maker available**:
- **Treat in patient's best interests** (emergency doctrine)
- Document: "Emergency treatment provided in patient's best interests. Patient lacks capacity for decision. No substitute decision-maker immediately available."

---

### Advance Care Directive (Advance Care Plan)

**Advance Care Directive**: Document prepared by person (when has capacity) stating treatment preferences if they lose capacity in future

**Not legally binding in NSW** (unlike some jurisdictions), but should be **strongly considered** in best interests decision-making

**May state**:
- Treatments patient would want / not want
- Values, beliefs (religious, cultural)
- Preferred decision-maker

**Example**:
- Patient with recurrent depression writes advance directive: "If I become severely depressed and lack capacity, I consent to ECT"
- Patient becomes severely depressed, lacks capacity
- Advance directive supports decision to proceed with ECT (with Tribunal approval if involuntary)

---

### Guardianship Tribunal (NCAT Guardianship Division)

**NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal (NCAT)** - Guardianship Division

**Functions**:
- Appoint guardians for adults who lack capacity (long-term)
- Make specific medical decisions
- Appoint financial managers

**When to involve**:
- Patient lacks capacity for important decision
- No substitute decision-maker available
- Disagreement among family members about treatment
- Concern about substitute decision-maker acting against patient's best interests

**Applications**:
- Family, doctors, social workers can apply
- Tribunal hears evidence, makes decision in patient's best interests

---

## 5. COMMON SCENARIOS IN OSCE

### Scenario 1: Patient Refusing Medication (Voluntary Patient with Capacity)

**Situation**: Voluntary psychiatric patient with depression refuses antidepressant

**Approach**:

1. **Explore reasons** for refusal:
   - "Can you tell me why you don't want to take the medication?"
   - Common reasons: Side effects, fear of addiction, stigma, prefer non-medication approach

2. **Assess capacity** (U-R-U-W-C):
   - Understand: "What is your understanding of why we've recommended medication?"
   - Use/weigh: "What are the pros and cons as you see them?"

3. **If HAS capacity**:
   - **Respect decision** (even if you disagree)
   - Explore alternatives: "I respect your decision. Would you consider psychological therapy? I can refer you to a psychologist through a Mental Health Plan."
   - Provide information: "If you change your mind, or if things get worse, please come back or call."
   - **Document**: "Patient has capacity, declines antidepressant, risks explained, psychological therapy offered, patient agrees to follow-up."

4. **If LACKS capacity** (e.g., severe depression with hopelessness preventing weighing benefits):
   - **Treat in best interests**
   - Involve substitute decision-maker if available
   - **Document**: "Patient lacks capacity for decision to refuse medication (unable to use and weigh information due to severe depression with hopelessness). Treatment commenced in patient's best interests."

**KEY**: **Capacity determines whether you respect refusal**
- Has capacity → Respect refusal
- Lacks capacity → Treat in best interests (may proceed despite refusal)

---

### Scenario 2: Patient Wants to Leave (Discharge Against Medical Advice)

**Situation**: Voluntary patient with mental illness wants to leave hospital

**Approach**:

1. **Explore reasons**:
   - "Can you tell me why you want to leave?"
   - Address concerns if possible (e.g., worried about children → facilitate contact)

2. **Explain risks**:
   - "I'm concerned that leaving now might put you at risk because [specific risks]. Can we talk about this?"

3. **Assess capacity** for decision to discharge:
   - Understand: "What is your understanding of your condition and our recommendations?"
   - Use/weigh: "What are the risks of leaving now? What might happen if you leave?"

4. **Does patient meet criteria for involuntary treatment?**
   - Mental illness? (Yes - e.g., depression, psychosis)
   - Risk of serious harm / serious deterioration? (Assess suicide risk, self-neglect risk)
   - Involuntary treatment necessary?

5. **Decision tree**:

   **A. Patient has capacity AND does NOT meet criteria for involuntary**:
   - **Allow to leave** (even if you disagree)
   - Provide safety plan: GP follow-up, crisis numbers (Lifeline 13 11 14), return if worsens
   - **Document**: "Patient has capacity, declines admission, does not meet criteria for involuntary treatment, risks explained, safety plan provided."

   **B. Patient has capacity BUT meets criteria for involuntary**:
   - **Example**: Patient with psychosis, high suicide risk, but can articulate decision
   - **Detain involuntarily** (Form 1 → Psychiatry for Schedule 1)
   - Explain: "I understand you want to leave, but I'm very concerned about your safety. I need to keep you here for a psychiatric assessment."
   - **Document**: "Patient meets criteria for involuntary treatment (psychotic, high suicide risk). Form 1 completed. Psychiatry notified."

   **C. Patient lacks capacity**:
   - **Detain** (Form 1 if meets criteria, or emergency doctrine)
   - Treat in best interests
   - **Document**: "Patient lacks capacity for decision to self-discharge (unable to use and weigh due to psychosis). Meets criteria for involuntary treatment. Form 1 completed."

**Common IMG Mistake**: Allowing high-risk patient to leave because "they want to" without assessing capacity or involuntary criteria

---

### Scenario 3: Family Requesting Involuntary Admission

**Situation**: Family brings patient to ED, requests psychiatric admission. Patient refuses.

**Approach**:

1. **Thank family** for bringing patient
2. **Assess patient** (history, MSE, risk assessment)
3. **Determine if criteria for involuntary treatment met**:
   - Mental illness?
   - Risk of serious harm / serious deterioration?
   - Involuntary treatment necessary?

4. **Decision tree**:

   **A. Criteria MET**:
   - Complete Form 1
   - Psychiatry assessment for Schedule 1
   - Explain to patient: "I understand you don't want to stay, but I'm concerned about your safety. I need to keep you here for assessment."
   - Explain to family: "I agree [patient] needs help. I'm going to arrange for assessment for admission."

   **B. Criteria NOT met**:
   - **Cannot admit involuntarily** (even if family requests)
   - Explain to patient: "You don't need to stay if you don't want to."
   - Explain to family: "I understand your concerns. However, [patient] does not meet the criteria for involuntary admission right now. This means they have the right to leave if they choose."
   - **Offer alternatives**:
     - Voluntary admission (if patient agrees)
     - Outpatient psychiatry/psychology referral
     - GP follow-up
     - Crisis team contact numbers
     - "If things worsen, please come back"

**KEY**: **Family request does NOT determine involuntary admission** - criteria must be met

**Common IMG Mistake**: Admitting patient involuntarily because "family requested" without proper criteria assessment

---

### Scenario 4: Assessing Capacity for Treatment Refusal in Psychosis

**Situation**: Patient with schizophrenia refuses antipsychotic medication

**Capacity Assessment**:

**1. Understand**:
- Doctor: "Can you tell me why we've recommended medication?"
- Patient: "You think I have schizophrenia and the medication will help the voices."
- **Assessment**: Patient can repeat information ✓

**2. Retain**:
- After 5 minutes: "Can you remind me what we discussed?"
- Patient: "You want me to take antipsychotic medication."
- **Assessment**: Retains ✓

**3. Use and Weigh** (CRITICAL):
- Doctor: "Do you think you have schizophrenia?"
- Patient: "No, I'm not sick. The voices are real - they're the FBI communicating with me. I don't need medication." (Delusion)
- Doctor: "What do you think will happen if you don't take medication?"
- Patient: "Nothing, because I'm not sick. The medication is poison to stop me from hearing the truth."
- **Assessment**: Patient's decision based on delusional belief that he is not ill, voices are real, medication is poison. **UNABLE to use and weigh** ✗

**4. Communicate**:
- Patient clearly states: "I refuse medication"
- **Assessment**: Communicates ✓

**Conclusion**: Patient **LACKS capacity** for decision to refuse medication (unable to use and weigh due to delusions)

**Management**:
- **If voluntary patient**: Treat in best interests (give medication), involve substitute decision-maker if available
- **If involuntary patient**: Can give medication under Mental Health Act
- **Document**: "Patient lacks capacity for decision re medication (unable to use and weigh - decision based on delusional belief that not ill, medication is poison). Medication commenced in patient's best interests / under Mental Health Act Schedule 1."

---

## 6. COMMON IMG MISTAKES - CAPACITY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK

### Mistake 1: Assuming Mental Illness = Lack of Capacity

**Wrong**: "Patient has schizophrenia, so lacks capacity"

**Correct**: "Patient has schizophrenia. I will assess capacity for the specific decision using the four-element framework."

**Principle**: Mental illness does NOT automatically mean lack of capacity. Many patients with psychiatric illness have capacity. **Always assess**.

---

### Mistake 2: Global Capacity Assessment

**Wrong**: "Patient lacks capacity" (vague, global statement)

**Correct**: "Patient lacks capacity **for decision to self-discharge** due to inability to use and weigh information (severe depression with hopelessness)."

**Principle**: Capacity is **decision-specific**. Patient may have capacity for some decisions but not others.

---

### Mistake 3: Poor Documentation

**Wrong**: "Patient lacks capacity. Treated."

**Correct**:
"**CAPACITY ASSESSMENT - Decision to consent to antidepressant**
- Understand: Patient able to explain back: 'You think I have depression, medication might help' ✓
- Retain: Able to recall after 5 minutes ✓
- Use/Weigh: Patient states 'Nothing will help, no point trying, I'm beyond help.' Unable to weigh potential benefits due to hopelessness (symptom of severe depression) ✗
- Communicate: Verbally communicates refusal ✓
- **Conclusion: Patient LACKS capacity** for this decision (unable to use and weigh)
- **Plan**: Commenced sertraline 50mg in patient's best interests. Will reassess capacity as depression improves."

**Principle**: Document **all four elements** with specific evidence. Medicolegal protection.

---

### Mistake 4: Not Maximizing Capacity

**Wrong**: Assessing capacity in patient with delirium, concluding lacks capacity, proceeding with treatment without attempting to optimize

**Correct**: Treat delirium (UTI, hydration, avoid sedatives), reassess capacity in 24-48 hours when delirium resolving

**Principle**: **Maximize capacity before concluding patient lacks capacity** (optimize timing, environment, communication, medical treatment)

---

### Mistake 5: Using Mental Health Act for Substance Intoxication Alone

**Wrong**: Patient intoxicated with alcohol, aggressive. Complete Form 1 / Schedule 1 for "substance use."

**Correct**:
- **Substance intoxication alone is NOT a mental illness** under Mental Health Act
- Manage intoxication medically (monitor, de-escalate, sedation if necessary for safety)
- **Reassess when sober** - if underlying mental illness evident (depression, psychosis), then consider Mental Health Act

**Exception**: Intoxication reveals underlying mental illness (e.g., psychosis triggered by methamphetamine in person with schizophrenia)

**Principle**: Cannot use Mental Health Act for substance intoxication alone

---

### Mistake 6: Admitting Involuntarily Because "Family Requested"

**Wrong**: Family brings patient, requests admission. Doctor admits involuntarily without assessing criteria.

**Correct**: Assess patient. Determine if **criteria met** (mental illness, risk of serious harm, involuntary treatment necessary). If criteria NOT met, cannot admit involuntarily (even if family requests).

**Principle**: **Criteria (not family request) determine involuntary admission**

---

### Mistake 7: Allowing High-Risk Patient to Leave Because "They Have Capacity"

**Wrong**: Patient with psychosis and high suicide risk wants to leave. Doctor assesses patient has capacity (can articulate decision), allows to leave.

**Correct**: **Having capacity does NOT prevent involuntary admission** if criteria met.
- Patient may have capacity BUT meet criteria for involuntary treatment (mental illness + risk of serious harm)
- Complete Form 1, psychiatry for Schedule 1

**Principle**: Involuntary admission based on **criteria** (mental illness, risk, necessity), NOT on capacity. Patient can have capacity AND still be detained if criteria met.

---

### Mistake 8: Treating Physical Illness Without Consent in Involuntary Patient

**Wrong**: Patient on Schedule 1 (involuntary psychiatric patient) needs appendectomy. Doctor proceeds without consent because "patient is involuntary."

**Correct**:
- Mental Health Act authorizes treatment of **mental illness** without consent
- **Does NOT authorize treatment of physical illness**
- Must still obtain consent for appendectomy (or assess capacity if patient refuses)

**Principle**: Mental Health Act applies to treatment of mental illness, NOT physical illness

---

### Mistake 9: Giving ECT to Involuntary Patient Without Tribunal Approval

**Wrong**: Involuntary patient, doctor recommends ECT, proceeds without Tribunal

**Correct**:
- ECT for involuntary patient requires **Mental Health Review Tribunal approval** (even if patient consents)
- Exception: Emergency (life-threatening, no time for Tribunal) - senior psychiatrist can authorize

**Principle**: ECT for involuntary patient = Tribunal approval required

---

### Mistake 10: Not Reassessing Capacity

**Wrong**: Patient assessed to lack capacity when acutely psychotic. Never reassessed. Continues to be treated without consent despite clinical improvement.

**Correct**: Capacity is **time-specific** - can fluctuate. Reassess regularly as clinical state changes. If patient regains capacity, must obtain consent for ongoing treatment.

**Principle**: **Reassess capacity** as clinical state changes

## OSCE PRACTICE STATIONS

### OSCE Station 1: Capacity Assessment - Treatment Refusal in Depression

**Scenario**:
You are the medical officer in the psychiatric ward. A 48-year-old woman, Margaret, has been admitted voluntarily with severe depression. She has been refusing antidepressant medication. The nursing staff have asked you to assess her capacity to refuse treatment and determine the next steps.

**Task (8 minutes)**:
- Assess Margaret's capacity to make decision about refusing antidepressant medication
- Determine whether she has capacity
- Explain management plan to nursing staff (examiner)

---

**Model Performance**:

**Opening (30 sec)**:
"Hello Margaret, I'm Dr. [Name]. The nurses mentioned you've decided not to take the antidepressant medication. I'd like to understand your decision better. Is that okay?"

**Explain the treatment (provide information for capacity assessment) (1 min)**:
"Let me first explain what we've recommended and why. We believe you have severe depression - a medical condition affecting the chemicals in your brain. We've recommended an antidepressant called sertraline. The medication takes about 2-4 weeks to work, and it can help improve your mood, sleep, energy, and the other symptoms of depression. Without treatment, there's a risk your depression may worsen. Common side effects include nausea and headaches initially, but these usually settle. Does that make sense so far?"

**Element 1: UNDERSTAND (1 min)**:
"Can you tell me in your own words what I've just explained?"

**Patient**: "You think I have depression. You want me to take medication that might help my mood."

**Assessment**: Patient able to repeat back information ✓ **UNDERSTANDS**

---

**Element 2: RETAIN (30 sec)**:
[After 2-3 minutes of discussion]
"Can you remind me what we discussed about the medication?"

**Patient**: "You said it's an antidepressant that takes a few weeks to work."

**Assessment**: Patient able to recall information ✓ **RETAINS**

---

**Element 3: USE and WEIGH (2 min - MOST IMPORTANT)**:
"What are your thoughts about taking the medication?"

**Patient**: "I don't want to take it."

"Can you help me understand why?"

**Patient**: "There's no point. Nothing will help me. I'm beyond help. I'm a burden to everyone."

"What do you think the benefits of the medication might be?"

**Patient**: "You say it might help my mood, but I don't think anything can help. I'm too far gone."

"What about the risks of not taking medication - what might happen?"

**Patient**: "I don't know. It doesn't matter anyway. Nothing matters."

"It sounds like you feel very hopeless. Do you think there's any chance the medication might help?"

**Patient**: "No. I'm worthless. There's no hope for me."

**Assessment**:
- Patient unable to weigh potential benefits of medication
- Decision based on hopelessness, worthlessness (symptoms of severe depression)
- Patient cannot consider that medication might help because depression prevents her from seeing any hope
- **UNABLE to use and weigh information** ✗

---

**Element 4: COMMUNICATE (30 sec)**:
"You've clearly told me you don't want the medication."

**Assessment**: Patient able to communicate decision verbally ✓ **COMMUNICATES**

---

**Conclusion and Explanation to Patient (1 min)**:
"Thank you for talking with me, Margaret. I can hear that you feel very hopeless and like nothing will help. That feeling of hopelessness is actually a symptom of your depression - it's the illness making you feel that way, not reality. Because of how severe your depression is, and because the hopelessness is preventing you from considering that treatment might help, I believe you're not able to make this decision right now. This means we will start the medication because it's in your best interests - it's the right treatment for you, and it may help you feel better. As your depression improves, we'll talk about this again. Do you have any questions?"

**Address concerns empathetically**:
"I know this is difficult, and I'm sorry you're feeling this way. We're here to help you."

---

**Explain to Nursing Staff / Examiner (2 min)**:

"I've completed a capacity assessment for Margaret regarding her decision to refuse antidepressant medication.

**Capacity Assessment**:
- **Understand**: ✓ Margaret can understand and repeat back the information about her diagnosis and treatment
- **Retain**: ✓ She can recall the information
- **Use and Weigh**: ✗ Margaret is **unable to use and weigh** the information. Her decision is based on hopelessness and worthlessness, which are symptoms of her severe depression. She cannot consider that medication might help because the depression makes her believe 'nothing will help, I'm beyond help, there's no point.'
- **Communicate**: ✓ She can clearly communicate her refusal

**Conclusion**: Margaret **LACKS capacity** for this decision. Specifically, she lacks the ability to use and weigh information due to severe depression with hopelessness.

**Management Plan**:
- We will **commence sertraline 50mg daily** in her **best interests**
- This is the appropriate treatment for severe depression
- Document thoroughly in notes: capacity assessment, rationale, best interests decision
- **Reassess capacity** regularly as her depression improves - if she regains capacity, we'll need her consent for ongoing treatment
- Continue supportive care, psychologist involvement
- Monitor response, side effects
- Explain to Margaret sensitively what we're doing and why

**I've documented the full capacity assessment in the notes for medicolegal protection.**"

---

**Summary**:
Clear, systematic capacity assessment using four-element framework. Identified specific element patient lacks (use and weigh). Linked impairment to symptoms of depression (hopelessness). Appropriate management (treat in best interests with plan for reassessment). Thorough documentation emphasized.

---

### OSCE Station 2: Involuntary Admission - Psychosis and Risk

**Scenario**:
You are the medical officer in the Emergency Department. A 25-year-old man, David, has been brought in by his family. They report he has not been sleeping, believes he can communicate with aliens, and has been making threats to harm his neighbors whom he believes are part of a conspiracy. David wants to leave. You need to assess whether he meets criteria for involuntary admission under the Mental Health Act.

**Task (8 minutes)**:
- Take focused history and perform mental state examination
- Assess if criteria for involuntary treatment met
- Explain to David that he needs to stay for assessment (if criteria met)
- Explain to examiner your reasoning and complete Form 1 documentation

---

**Model Performance**:

**Opening (30 sec)**:
"Hello David, I'm Dr. [Name], one of the doctors here in Emergency. I understand your family brought you in because they're concerned about you. I'd like to understand what's been happening. Is that okay?"

**Presenting complaint (1 min)**:
"How have you been feeling?"

**Patient**: "I'm fine. I don't know why I'm here. My family doesn't understand."

"Can you tell me what's been going on recently?"

**Patient**: "I've been receiving messages from a higher intelligence - aliens. They've chosen me to help protect humanity from the conspiracy."

"When did this start?"

**Patient**: "About a month ago."

---

**Assess psychotic symptoms (2 min)**:

**Delusions**:
"You mentioned a conspiracy. Can you tell me more?"

**Patient**: "My neighbors are part of it. They're working with the government. They're monitoring me, trying to stop my mission."

"What is your mission?"

**Patient**: "To expose the truth. The aliens have given me special knowledge."

**Hallucinations**:
"Do you hear the aliens speaking to you?"

**Patient**: "Yes, I can hear their communications. They guide me."

"What do they tell you?"

**Patient**: "They tell me who to trust, who is part of the conspiracy. Sometimes they tell me to take action."

---

**Violence risk (1.5 min - CRITICAL)**:

"You mentioned your neighbors. Have you thought about harming them?"

**Patient**: "They're dangerous. I need to protect myself. I have a plan to deal with them."

"What is your plan?"

**Patient**: "I can't tell you - you might be part of it too."

"Have you done anything to harm them?"

**Patient**: "Not yet. But I will if I need to."

**Assessment**: **HIGH VIOLENCE RISK** - paranoid delusions about neighbors, command hallucinations ("take action"), intent to harm, vague plan, actively psychotic

---

**Insight (30 sec)**:

"Do you think you might be unwell?"

**Patient**: "I'm not sick. I'm enlightened. You don't understand. I need to leave."

**Assessment**: **NO insight**

---

**Functional impairment (30 sec)**:

"Are you working? How are you managing day-to-day?"

**Patient**: "I stopped working - they were monitoring me there too. I spend my time preparing for the mission."

---

**Mental State Examination Summary** (observe throughout):
- **Appearance**: 25-year-old man, disheveled, poor hygiene, agitated
- **Behavior**: Restless, suspicious, poor eye contact
- **Speech**: Pressured at times
- **Mood**: "Focused" (subjective)
- **Affect**: Suspicious, guarded
- **Thought Content**: Paranoid delusions (conspiracy, neighbors, government monitoring), grandiose delusions (chosen by aliens, special mission). **Command hallucinations** from "aliens" to "take action." Intent to harm neighbors.
- **Perception**: Auditory hallucinations (aliens communicating)
- **Cognition**: Oriented
- **Insight**: None - does not believe he is unwell

---

**Explain to David (need to stay for assessment) (1.5 min)**:

"David, I understand you want to leave, but I'm very concerned about your safety and the safety of others. Based on what you've told me, I believe you're experiencing some mental health symptoms - the beliefs about aliens and the conspiracy, and hearing voices. I'm particularly concerned about your thoughts of harming your neighbors. Because of these concerns, I need to keep you here so a psychiatrist can assess you properly. I know this isn't what you want, but it's important for your safety and the safety of others."

**If patient becomes agitated**:
"I understand you're frustrated. We're here to help you. Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable while you wait for the assessment?" (Offer water, food, quiet room)

---

**Explain to Examiner / Complete Form 1 (2 min)**:

"I believe David meets criteria for involuntary assessment and treatment under the Mental Health Act.

**Criterion 1: Mental Illness** ✓
- David is experiencing **psychotic disorder** (likely schizophrenia or drug-induced psychosis)
- Evidence: Paranoid delusions (neighbors part of conspiracy, government monitoring), grandiose delusions (chosen by aliens for mission), auditory hallucinations (aliens communicating, command hallucinations to "take action")
- Duration: 1 month
- Functional impairment: Stopped working, preoccupied with delusional beliefs

**Criterion 2: Risk of Serious Harm** ✓
- **HIGH risk of violence to others** (neighbors)
- Evidence:
  - Paranoid delusions about neighbors ("they're dangerous")
  - Intent to harm ("I need to deal with them", "I will if I need to")
  - Vague plan
  - Command hallucinations to "take action"
  - Actively psychotic, no insight
  - **Risk is IMMINENT**

**Criterion 3: Involuntary Treatment Necessary** ✓
- David refuses voluntary admission, wants to leave
- No insight (does not believe he is unwell)
- Community treatment insufficient (high risk, needs immediate containment and treatment)
- No less restrictive alternative

**ALL THREE criteria met** → **Form 1 completed**

**Immediate Management**:
1. **Form 1** (detain for up to 12 hours for psychiatric assessment)
2. **Psychiatry consult URGENT** for Schedule 1 assessment
3. **Safety**:
   - 1:1 nursing observation (high risk - violence, absconding)
   - Inform security (potential for aggression)
   - Remove sharps, potential weapons
   - Quiet, low-stimulation environment
4. **Investigations** (first-episode psychosis protocol):
   - Urine drug screen (cannabis, methamphetamine - can cause psychosis)
   - Bloods: FBC, UEC, LFTs, glucose, calcium, TSH, B12, HIV, syphilis
   - CT brain (rule out organic cause)
5. **Pharmacological**:
   - Offer oral antipsychotic: Risperidone 2mg or Olanzapine 10mg
   - PRN available for agitation: Olanzapine wafer 10mg, Lorazepam 1-2mg PO
   - If refuses oral and severely agitated: Olanzapine 10mg IM or Haloperidol 5mg IM + Lorazepam 2mg IM
6. **Police involvement**: If patient tries to leave before psychiatry assessment, police may need to bring back (Form 1 allows detention)
7. **Collateral from family**: Get more history (timeline, previous episodes, drug use, family history)
8. **Risk to neighbors**: If specific, identifiable threat and patient likely to be released, consider **duty to warn** (Tarasoff principle - duty to protect third party). Discuss with senior, psychiatry, legal. May need to notify police.

**Expected outcome**: Psychiatry will likely place on **Schedule 1** (involuntary admission) given high risk and psychosis.

**Documentation**:
'25-year-old man presenting with psychotic symptoms (paranoid and grandiose delusions, auditory hallucinations including command hallucinations) and **HIGH violence risk** (intent to harm neighbors based on paranoid delusions). No insight, refuses admission. **Meets criteria for involuntary treatment**: mental illness (psychosis), risk of serious harm (violence to others - imminent), involuntary treatment necessary (refuses voluntary, no insight, high risk requires containment). **Form 1 completed**. Psychiatry notified for urgent assessment. 1:1 observation. Safety measures in place.'
"

---

**Summary**:
Systematic assessment of psychosis and risk. Clear identification that all three criteria for involuntary treatment met. Appropriate immediate management including Form 1, safety measures, investigations, and psychiatry referral. Consideration of duty to warn regarding specific threat. Thorough documentation.

## SUMMARY: KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR ICRP

### Capacity Assessment Framework

**U-R-U-W-C Mnemonic**:
1. **Understand** information
2. **Retain** information
3. **Use and Weigh** information (most complex - can they appreciate consequences, weigh pros/cons?)
4. **Communicate** decision

**Principles**:
- **Assume capacity** unless proven otherwise
- **Decision-specific** (not global)
- **Time-specific** (can fluctuate - reassess)
- **Maximize capacity** before concluding patient lacks it (optimize timing, environment, communication, treatment)
- **Document thoroughly** (all four elements, specific evidence)

**Key Point**: **Mental illness ≠ lack of capacity** (always assess)

---

### Mental Health Act NSW 2007

**Criteria for Involuntary Treatment** (ALL THREE required):
1. **Mental illness** (excludes substance intoxication alone, personality disorder alone)
2. **Risk of serious harm** to self/others OR serious deterioration
3. **Involuntary treatment necessary** (no less restrictive alternative)

**Forms**:
- **Form 1**: Any doctor, 12 hours, allows detention for assessment
- **Schedule 1**: Psychiatrist only, up to 3 months, involuntary admission
- **CTO**: Community Treatment Order (involuntary treatment in community)

**Key Points**:
- Mental Health Act authorizes treatment of **mental illness** (NOT physical illness)
- ECT for involuntary patient requires **Tribunal approval**
- Involuntary patients reviewed by **Mental Health Review Tribunal** within 21 days

---

### Decision Trees for Common Scenarios

**Patient Refusing Treatment**:
1. Assess capacity (U-R-U-W-C)
2. If **HAS capacity** → Respect decision (even if you disagree)
3. If **LACKS capacity** → Treat in best interests (involve substitute decision-maker if available)

**Patient Wants to Leave**:
1. Explore reasons, explain risks
2. Assess capacity for decision to self-discharge
3. Assess if meets criteria for involuntary treatment (mental illness, risk, necessity)
4. Decision:
   - Has capacity + does NOT meet involuntary criteria → **Allow to leave** (safety plan)
   - Has capacity + meets involuntary criteria → **Detain** (Form 1 → Schedule 1)
   - Lacks capacity → **Detain** (treat in best interests, or involuntary if criteria met)

**Key Point**: **Having capacity does NOT prevent involuntary admission** if criteria met

---

### Substitute Decision-Making

**Hierarchy** (when patient lacks capacity):
1. **Enduring Guardian** (if appointed)
2. **Person Responsible**: Spouse/partner → Carer → Close friend/relative
3. **NCAT** (if no one above, or disagreement)
4. **Emergency**: Treat in patient's best interests if urgent and no substitute available

**Advance Care Directive**: Not legally binding in NSW, but strongly consider in best interests decision-making

---

### Common IMG Mistakes to AVOID

1. **Mental illness = lack of capacity** → WRONG (always assess)
2. **Global capacity statement** → WRONG (must be decision-specific)
3. **Poor documentation** → WRONG (document all four elements with evidence)
4. **Not maximizing capacity** → WRONG (optimize before concluding lacks capacity)
5. **Using Mental Health Act for substance intoxication alone** → WRONG (not a mental illness)
6. **Admitting involuntarily because family requested** → WRONG (criteria must be met)
7. **Allowing high-risk patient to leave because "they have capacity"** → WRONG (can have capacity AND meet involuntary criteria)
8. **Treating physical illness without consent in involuntary patient** → WRONG (Mental Health Act only covers mental illness treatment)
9. **ECT without Tribunal approval in involuntary patient** → WRONG (Tribunal required except emergency)
10. **Not reassessing capacity** → WRONG (capacity can change - reassess regularly)
