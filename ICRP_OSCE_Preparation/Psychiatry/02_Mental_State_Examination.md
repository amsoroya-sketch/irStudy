## Dr. Amir Soufi's Principle Applied to Mental State Examination

> **"MSE is a SNAPSHOT of the patient's mental state RIGHT NOW - it's the psychiatric equivalent of physical examination. MSE findings CONFIRM your differential from history: If history suggests depression, MSE should show low mood, psychomotor retardation, poor eye contact. If history suggests psychosis, MSE should show hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder. MSE findings that DON'T match history = Red flag (patient hiding symptoms, delirium, malingering, or you've misunderstood the history)."**

### The MSE Mindset

**Mental State Examination (MSE)** = Assessment of patient's CURRENT mental state during interview

**vs**

**Psychiatric History** = Longitudinal account of patient's symptoms over time

**Example**:
- **History**: "Patient reports hearing voices for the past 2 months, telling him he's worthless"
- **MSE**: "Patient appeared to be responding to internal stimuli (pausing mid-sentence, looking to left, tilting head as if listening). When asked, confirmed currently hearing male voice saying 'You're useless'."

**Dr. Amir's Pattern Recognition**:

**Depression MSE pattern**:
- Appearance: Poor self-care, unkempt
- Behavior: Reduced eye contact, psychomotor retardation
- Speech: Slow, quiet, reduced quantity, increased latency
- Mood: "Low", "Terrible", "Empty"
- Affect: Congruent low mood, restricted range
- Thought: Themes of guilt, worthlessness, hopelessness; no psychosis
- Perception: Usually normal (unless severe depression with psychotic features)
- Cognition: Impaired concentration, may have pseudodementia
- Insight: Usually good (knows they're depressed)

**Psychosis (Schizophrenia) MSE pattern**:
- Appearance: May be disheveled, bizarre clothing
- Behavior: Responding to internal stimuli, guarded, poor eye contact
- Speech: May have thought disorder (tangential, loosening of associations)
- Mood: May be blunted, incongruent
- Affect: Flat or incongruent (laughing when discussing sad topic)
- Thought: Delusions (persecutory, grandiose, referential), thought insertion/withdrawal/broadcasting
- Perception: Auditory hallucinations (running commentary, third-person, command), may have visual
- Cognition: May be impaired
- Insight: Poor (doesn't believe they're ill)

**Mania MSE pattern**:
- Appearance: Brightly colored clothing, overly groomed or disheveled, makeup/jewelry excessive
- Behavior: Distractible, overactive, overfamiliar, intrusive
- Speech: Pressured (rapid, loud, difficult to interrupt), may have flight of ideas
- Mood: "Fantastic!", "Incredible!", "Never been better!"
- Affect: Elevated, euphoric, or irritable if challenged; labile (rapid changes)
- Thought: Grandiose delusions, racing thoughts
- Perception: May have mood-congruent hallucinations (God speaking to them)
- Cognition: Poor concentration (distractible)
- Insight: Poor (doesn't see problem)

## The MSE Framework: ABC STAMP

**A - Appearance and Behavior**
**B - Behavior (Motor)**
**C - Cognitive Function**
**S - Speech**
**T - Thought (Form and Content)**
**A - Affect and Mood**
**M - Perception**
**P - Plus Insight and Judgment**

*Note: Different frameworks exist (some use "ASEPTIC"), but ABC STAMP is comprehensive and easy to remember*

---

## 1. APPEARANCE

**What you observe**: Physical appearance, grooming, hygiene, clothing, physical health indicators

### Systematic Assessment

**Apparent Age**:
- Does patient look their stated age?
- "45-year-old woman appearing stated age" vs "appearing older than stated age" (chronic illness, poor self-care, substance use)

**Body Habitus**:
- Thin, average, overweight, obese, cachectic (severe weight loss/wasting)
- "Thin build" (eating disorder?), "Obese" (atypical depression, antipsychotic side effect)

**Grooming and Hygiene**:
- Well-groomed vs unkempt, clean vs dirty
- Hair: Combed, styled, or disheveled, matted
- Nails: Clean, dirty, bitten (anxiety)
- Facial hair: Shaved (men) or unshaven
- Body odor: Present or absent
- **Examples**:
  - "Well-groomed, clean, no body odor" (normal, or high-functioning despite illness)
  - "Poor hygiene, disheveled hair, body odor present, appearing not to have washed recently" (severe depression, psychosis, dementia, substance use, homelessness)

**Clothing**:
- Appropriate for weather, season, setting?
- Clean, torn, mismatched, bizarre
- **Examples**:
  - "Casually dressed, clothing clean and appropriate for setting" (normal)
  - "Wearing winter coat in summer, multiple layers" (homelessness, poverty, psychosis)
  - "Brightly colored mismatched clothing, excessive jewelry" (mania)
  - "Wearing sunglasses indoors, hood up" (paranoia, photophobia in migraine/mania)

**Physical Health Indicators**:
- Scars (self-harm: linear scars on forearms, wrists)
- Tattoos, piercings
- Signs of substance use:
  - Track marks (IV drug use)
  - Nasal septum perforation (cocaine insufflation)
  - Poor dentition (methamphetamine "meth mouth", bulimia - erosion of enamel from vomiting)
  - Jaundice (alcohol-related liver disease)
  - Spider naevi, palmar erythema (chronic liver disease)
- Tremor: Fine (anxiety, hyperthyroidism, alcohol withdrawal, lithium), coarse (Parkinson's, antipsychotic side effect)
- Abnormal movements: Tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements of face/tongue - antipsychotic side effect), akathisia (restlessness - antipsychotic side effect)

**Distinguishing Features**:
- Glasses, hearing aids, walking aids (cane, walker)

## 2. BEHAVIOR (Motor Activity and Interaction)

**What you observe**: How patient interacts with you and environment, motor activity level, eye contact, rapport

### Eye Contact

**Normal**: Maintains appropriate eye contact, looks at you when speaking/listening

**Abnormal**:
- **Reduced/Avoidant**: Depression, social anxiety, autism, cultural (in some cultures, direct eye contact is disrespectful)
- **Intense/Staring**: Psychosis (paranoia), mania, autism
- **Darting/Suspicious**: Paranoia, anxiety

**Documentation**:
- "Maintained good eye contact throughout" (normal)
- "Minimal eye contact, gaze averted" (depression, anxiety, cultural)
- "Intense, unwavering eye contact" (mania, paranoia)

---

### Rapport

**Normal**: Cooperative, engaged, responsive to questions

**Abnormal**:
- **Guarded**: Suspicious, reluctant to answer questions (paranoia, personality disorder)

- **Hostile**: Angry, aggressive (mania - if challenged, paranoia, antisocial personality disorder, intoxication)
- **Withdrawn**: Minimal interaction (severe depression, negative symptoms of schizophrenia, autism)

**Documentation**:
- "Cooperative and engaged throughout interview" (normal)
- "Guarded, reluctant to answer questions, appeared suspicious of interviewer" (paranoia)
- "Overfamiliar, addressed interviewer by first name unsolicited, invaded personal space" (mania, disinhibition)

---

### Motor Activity (Psychomotor)

**Normal**: Appropriate movement, settled

**Abnormal**:

**Psychomotor Retardation** (slowed):
- Slow movements, reduced spontaneous movement
- Long pauses before responding
- Reduced facial expression
- **Severe**: Stupor (motionless, mute, but conscious)
- **Seen in**: Depression, Parkinson's disease, antipsychotic side effects, hypothyroidism

**Psychomotor Agitation** (increased):
- Restlessness, fidgeting, unable to sit still
- Pacing, hand-wringing, picking at skin/clothing
- **Akathisia** (antipsychotic-induced restlessness - patient feels compelled to move)
- **Seen in**: Anxiety, agitated depression, mania, delirium, akathisia, alcohol/benzodiazepine withdrawal

**Abnormal Movements**:
- **Tremor**: Fine (anxiety, withdrawal, thyrotoxicosis, lithium) vs coarse (Parkinson's, essential tremor)
- **Tardive dyskinesia**: Involuntary repetitive movements (lip smacking, chewing, tongue protrusion, grimacing) - late complication of antipsychotics
- **Dystonia**: Sustained muscle contractions (torticollis, oculogyric crisis) - acute antipsychotic side effect
- **Tics**: Sudden, rapid, recurrent movements or vocalizations (Tourette syndrome, stimulant use)
- **Catatonia**: Motor immobility (stupor), excessive motor activity (excitement), posturing, waxy flexibility, echolalia, echopraxia - seen in schizophrenia, mood disorders, medical conditions

**Responding to Internal Stimuli**:

**Documentation**:
- "Normal psychomotor activity" (normal)
- "Psychomotor retardation noted - slow movements, long latency before responses, reduced spontaneous movement" (depression)
- "Psychomotor agitation - restless, fidgeting, pacing around room" (anxiety, mania)
- "Appeared to be responding to internal stimuli - paused mid-sentence, looked to left, tilted head as if listening" (auditory hallucinations)

---

## 3. SPEECH

**What you observe**: Rate, volume, quantity, tone, spontaneity

**Speech is the WINDOW into thought** - speech abnormalities often reflect thought disorder

### Rate

**Normal**: Conversational pace

**Abnormal**:
- **Slow**: Depression, hypothyroidism, sedation (medications, substances)
- **Rapid**: Mania, anxiety, hyperthyroidism, stimulant use
- **Pressured** (extreme rapid): Mania - rapid, loud, difficult to interrupt, feels driven to speak

### Volume

**Normal**: Conversational volume

**Abnormal**:
- **Quiet/Soft**: Depression, anxiety, paranoia (doesn't want to be overheard)
- **Loud**: Mania, deafness, psychosis

### Quantity (Amount)

**Normal**: Appropriate responses, not overly verbose or monosyllabic

**Abnormal**:
- **Reduced** (poverty of speech): Depression, negative symptoms of schizophrenia, selective mutism
- **Increased** (logorrhoea): Mania, anxiety, some personality disorders

### Tone

**Normal**: Varied intonation (prosody)

**Abnormal**:
- **Monotone**: Depression, Parkinson's disease, negative symptoms of schizophrenia, autism
- **Overly animated**: Mania

### Fluency

**Normal**: Fluent, no difficulty finding words

**Abnormal**:
- **Dysarthria**: Difficulty articulating (slurred speech) - neurological cause (stroke, alcohol intoxication, sedative medication)
- **Dysphasia**: Difficulty with language (expressive: can't find words; receptive: can't understand) - neurological cause (stroke, dementia)
- **Stutter**: Repetition of sounds or syllables - developmental or onset with anxiety

### Spontaneity

**Normal**: Spontaneous responses, initiates conversation

**Abnormal**:
- **Reduced spontaneity**: Answers only when asked, doesn't elaborate, doesn't initiate - depression, autism, intellectual disability
- **Excessive spontaneity**: Interrupts, speaks before being asked - mania, ADHD

### Latency (Delay Before Response)

**Normal**: Answers promptly

**Abnormal**:
- **Increased latency**: Long pause before answering - depression, thought blocking (schizophrenia), cognitive impairment
- **Reduced latency**: Answers before question finished - mania, ADHD

### Documentation Examples

- "Speech: Normal rate, volume, and quantity. Spontaneous and fluent." (Normal)
- "Speech: Slow rate, reduced volume and quantity. Increased latency before responses. Monotone." (Depression)
- "Speech: Pressured (rapid, loud, difficult to interrupt). Increased quantity, spontaneous." (Mania)

---

## 4. MOOD and AFFECT

**Critical distinction**:
- **Mood** = Patient's SUBJECTIVE description of emotional state (how patient FEELS)
- **Affect** = Examiner's OBJECTIVE observation of emotional expression (how patient APPEARS)

### MOOD (Subjective)

**How to assess**:
- Ask directly: "How would you describe your mood?" "How are you feeling?"
- Use patient's OWN WORDS in documentation

**Examples**:
- Depression: "Low", "Sad", "Empty", "Numb", "Terrible", "Black"
- Anxiety: "Anxious", "Worried", "On edge", "Scared"
- Mania: "Fantastic", "Amazing", "On top of the world", "Never been better"
- Euthymic (normal): "Good", "Okay", "Alright", "Not too bad"
- Irritable: "Angry", "Frustrated", "Irritable"

**Document as**: Mood: "Low" (patient's words in quotes)

**If patient can't describe mood**:
- Rate on scale: "On a scale of 0-10, where 0 is the worst you've ever felt and 10 is the best, where would you put yourself now?" (Mood: 3/10)

---

### AFFECT (Objective)

**Affect** = Observable expression of emotion through facial expression, body language, tone of voice

Describe affect using 4 parameters:

#### 1. Type/Quality

**Normal**:
- **Euthymic**: Normal mood

**Abnormal**:
- **Depressed/Low**: Sad facial expression, tearful, downturned mouth
- **Elevated/Euphoric**: Excessively happy, smiling, laughing
- **Anxious**: Worried facial expression, tense
- **Irritable**: Annoyed, frustrated expression
- **Angry**: Hostile expression
- **Flat**: No emotional expression, blank face (negative symptom of schizophrenia, severe depression)
- **Blunted**: Reduced but not absent emotional expression (less severe than flat)

#### 2. Range

**Normal**:
- **Full range**: Expresses variety of emotions during interview (can be happy, sad, worried appropriately)

**Abnormal**:
- **Restricted/Limited range**: Few emotional expressions (depression, negative symptoms of schizophrenia)
- **Blunted**: Markedly reduced range
- **Flat**: No range, no emotional expression

#### 3. Congruence (Does affect match mood and content of thought?)

**Congruent**:
- Affect matches mood (patient says "I'm sad" and looks sad)
- Affect matches thought content (patient discusses sad topic and looks sad)

**Incongruent**:
- Affect doesn't match mood (patient says "I'm sad" but is smiling)
- Affect doesn't match thought content (patient discusses death of parent while laughing)
- **Seen in**: Schizophrenia, frontal lobe pathology, some personality disorders

#### 4. Reactivity/Mobility (Does affect change during interview?)

**Reactive**:
- Affect changes appropriately in response to topics discussed

**Non-reactive/Fixed**:
- Affect doesn't change regardless of topic
- **Seen in**: Severe depression, negative symptoms of schizophrenia

### Documentation Examples

- "Affect: Euthymic, full range, congruent with mood and thought content, reactive." (Normal)
- "Affect: Low mood, restricted range, congruent with mood and thought content." (Depression)
- "Affect: Elevated, full range, congruent with mood." (Mania)
- "Affect: Flat (no emotional expression observed), incongruent (smiled when discussing death of mother)." (Schizophrenia)
- "Affect: Anxious, full range, reactive, congruent." (Anxiety)

## 5. THOUGHT

Assess **two** aspects:
1. **Form** (How patient thinks - structure of thought)
2. **Content** (What patient thinks - topics, delusions, obsessions, suicidal ideation)

### THOUGHT FORM (How Patient Thinks)

**Assessed through SPEECH** - abnormalities in speech reflect thought disorder

**Normal**:
- **Linear/Logical**: Thoughts follow logical sequence, goal-directed

**Abnormal**:

**Circumstantial**:
- Provides excessive unnecessary detail before eventually reaching point
- "Roundabout" - gets there in the end
- **Example**: Asked "How did you get here today?" Patient: "Well, I woke up this morning and had breakfast, which was cereal, corn flakes actually, with milk, and then I brushed my teeth, and then I got dressed and put on my blue shirt, and then I walked to the bus stop and waited for the bus, which was 5 minutes late, and then I caught the bus here."
- **Seen in**: Obsessive traits, anxiety, intellectual disability, dementia

**Tangential**:
- Goes off-topic, never returns to original point
- **Example**: Asked "How did you get here?" Patient: "I came by bus. Buses are very unreliable these days. The government should invest more in public transport. I used to work for the government, you know..."
- **Seen in**: Mania, schizophrenia, ADHD

**Flight of Ideas**:
- Rapid jumping between topics, with DISCERNIBLE connections (rhyming, punning, clang associations)
- **Example**: "I came by bus, the driver was very gruff, I've had enough, I need some snuff, it's very tough, living rough..." (rhyming - clang association)
- **Seen in**: Mania

**Loosening of Associations** (Derailment):
- Jumping between topics with NO discernible connection ("knight's move thinking")
- **Example**: "I came by bus. My mother had blue eyes. Trains are made of metal."
- **Seen in**: Schizophrenia

**Word Salad**:
- Completely incoherent speech, words strung together with no meaning
- **Example**: "Bus the walking mother sky today elephant purple question."
- **Seen in**: Severe schizophrenia

**Thought Blocking**:
- Sudden interruption in train of thought, mid-sentence
- Patient stops speaking, appears to lose train of thought, can't continue
- **Seen in**: Schizophrenia

**Perseveration**:
- Repeating same word or phrase over and over
- **Example**: Asked "How are you today?" "I'm fine." "What brings you here?" "I'm fine." "What's your name?" "I'm fine."
- **Seen in**: Schizophrenia, dementia, brain injury

**Neologisms**:
- Made-up words with no meaning
- **Example**: "I came here on the blargship" (blargship = made-up word)
- **Seen in**: Schizophrenia

**Clang Associations**:
- Words chosen based on sound (rhyming) rather than meaning
- **Example**: "I'm feeling fine, drinking wine, it's time to dine, reading a sign..."
- **Seen in**: Mania, schizophrenia

### Documentation Examples

- "Thought form: Linear and goal-directed." (Normal)
- "Thought form: Circumstantial - provides excessive detail but eventually reaches point." (Anxiety, obsessive traits)
- "Thought form: Tangential - goes off-topic, doesn't return to original point." (Mania)
- "Thought form: Loosening of associations noted - jumps between unrelated topics. Evidence of thought blocking mid-sentence." (Schizophrenia)

---

### THOUGHT CONTENT (What Patient Thinks)

**Normal**:
- Age-appropriate concerns (work, family, health, finances)
- No pathological preoccupations

**Abnormal**:

#### Delusions

**Delusion** = Fixed, false belief, not shared by patient's culture/religion, held with strong conviction despite evidence to contrary

**Types**:

**Persecutory** (most common):
- Belief that others are trying to harm, follow, poison, plot against patient
- **Example**: "The CIA is following me", "My neighbors are poisoning my water"

**Grandiose**:
- Inflated sense of worth, power, knowledge, identity
- **Example**: "I am God's messenger", "I have special powers", "I'm a billionaire" (when not true)

**Referential** (Ideas of Reference):
- Belief that neutral events have special personal significance
- **Example**: "The TV news is about me", "People on the street are talking about me", "Songs on the radio contain messages for me"

**Erotomanic**:
- False belief that someone (usually higher status) is in love with patient
- **Example**: "Brad Pitt is in love with me and sends me secret messages"

**Jealous** (Othello syndrome):
- Unfounded belief that partner is unfaithful

**Somatic**:
- False belief about bodily functions or sensations
- **Example**: "I have cancer" (when medical tests show no cancer), "Worms are eating my brain"

**Nihilistic**:
- Belief that self, others, or world doesn't exist or is about to end
- **Example**: "I'm dead", "The world has ended"

**Bizarre** (First-Rank Symptoms of Schizophrenia):
- **Thought insertion**: Belief that thoughts are being put into one's mind by external force
- **Thought withdrawal**: Belief that thoughts are being removed from one's mind
- **Thought broadcasting**: Belief that one's thoughts are being broadcast so others can hear them
- **Passivity phenomena**: Belief that one's actions, feelings, impulses are controlled by external force
- **Example**: "The government is inserting thoughts into my brain via satellite"

**Assessing Delusions**:
- Don't challenge directly (damages rapport)
- Ask exploratory questions: "Tell me more about that", "How do you know?", "What evidence do you have?"
- Assess conviction: "How certain are you about this?" (0-100%)
- Assess impact: "How does this affect your life?"

---

#### Obsessions

**Obsession** = Recurrent, intrusive, unwanted thoughts, images, or urges that cause anxiety

**Common themes**: Contamination, harm, symmetry, sexual/religious

**Example**: "I have constant thoughts that I've left the stove on and the house will burn down. I know it's irrational, but I can't stop thinking it."

**Differentiate from delusions**: Patient with obsessions has INSIGHT (knows thoughts are irrational), patient with delusions has NO insight (believes delusion is real)

---

#### Suicidal Ideation

**See Risk Assessment section** - always assess in depression, psychosis, substance use

**Document**:
- "Denies suicidal ideation" (if absent)
- "Passive suicidal ideation present ('wishes could go to sleep and not wake up'), no active suicidal ideation, no plan, no intent" (if passive)
- "Active suicidal ideation with plan (overdose on saved medications), high intent, minimal protective factors identified" (if active - requires urgent action)

---

#### Homicidal/Violent Ideation

**Assess if**: History of violence, anger/irritability, paranoid delusions, command hallucinations

**Document**:
- "Denies homicidal ideation" (if absent)
- "Expresses anger toward ex-partner but denies homicidal ideation or intent" (angry but not violent ideation)
- "Expresses intent to harm ex-partner ('I'm going to kill him'), has plan (knife), has access to victim. High risk of violence." (requires urgent action)

---

### Documentation Examples - Thought Content

- "Thought content: No delusions, obsessions, or suicidal/homicidal ideation elicited. Preoccupied with work stress." (Normal)
- "Thought content: Persecutory delusions ('neighbors are poisoning my food'), grandiose delusions ('I have special powers from God'). Denies suicidal ideation." (Schizophrenia with psychosis)
- "Thought content: Themes of guilt and worthlessness. Passive suicidal ideation present, no active ideation or plan." (Depression)
- "Thought content: Obsessive thoughts about contamination, causing significant distress. Insight preserved (recognizes thoughts are excessive)." (OCD)

---

## 6. PERCEPTION

**Perception** = How patient experiences the world through senses

**Abnormalities**:
1. Hallucinations
2. Illusions
3. Depersonalization
4. Derealization

### Hallucinations

**Hallucination** = Perception in absence of external stimulus (perceiving something that isn't there)

#### Auditory Hallucinations (Most Common in Schizophrenia)

**Types**:

**Second-Person** (voices speaking TO patient):
- "You're useless", "Kill yourself", "Everyone hates you"
- Command hallucinations → RISK ASSESSMENT needed

**Third-Person** (voices speaking ABOUT patient):
- "She's stupid", "He's going to hurt himself"
- **First-rank symptom of schizophrenia** if voices argue about patient or provide running commentary

**Running Commentary**:
- Voices narrating patient's actions: "He's walking now", "She's opening the door"

**Thought Echo**:
- Hearing one's own thoughts spoken aloud

**Assessing Auditory Hallucinations**:
- "Do you hear voices when no one is around?"
- **If yes**:
  - "How many voices?" (One, several)
  - "Male or female?"
  - "Do you recognize the voices?" (God, devil, deceased relative, stranger)
  - "What do they say?" (Content)
  - "Do they talk to you or about you?" (Second-person vs third-person)
  - "Do they tell you to do things?" (Command hallucinations)
  - "Do you feel you have to obey them?" (Compulsion to obey = higher risk)

---

#### Visual Hallucinations

**RED FLAG**: Visual hallucinations are MORE common in ORGANIC psychosis than functional psychosis

**Causes**:
- **Organic**: Delirium, dementia (Lewy body dementia), Charles Bonnet syndrome (visual loss), seizures (occipital lobe), migraine aura, hypnagogic/hypnopompic (falling asleep/waking - normal)
- **Substances**: LSD, psilocybin (magic mushrooms), alcohol withdrawal (delirium tremens)
- **Psychiatric**: Schizophrenia (less common than auditory), severe depression with psychotic features

**Examples**:
- "Seeing spiders crawling on walls" (delirium tremens, stimulant use)
- "Seeing deceased relatives" (grief hallucinations - common in bereavement, not pathological if limited to first few weeks)

---

#### Other Hallucinations

**Olfactory** (smell):
- **Causes**: Temporal lobe epilepsy, brain tumor, schizophrenia
- **Example**: "Smelling burning when nothing is burning"

**Gustatory** (taste):
- **Causes**: Temporal lobe epilepsy
- **Example**: "Metallic taste in mouth"

**Tactile** (touch):
- **Causes**: Delirium tremens, stimulant use (formication - sensation of bugs crawling on skin), schizophrenia
- **Example**: "Feeling bugs crawling under skin" (cocaine, methamphetamine use)

**Somatic** (bodily sensations):
- **Example**: "Feeling internal organs moving", "Feeling electricity flowing through body"

---

### Illusions

**Illusion** = Misperception of REAL external stimulus (perceiving something that IS there, but incorrectly)

**Example**: Seeing coat hanging on door and perceiving it as a person

**Causes**: Normal (in poor lighting, when tired), delirium, anxiety

**Differentiate from hallucination**: Illusion has REAL stimulus (coat), hallucination has NO stimulus

---

### Depersonalization

**Depersonalization** = Feeling detached from oneself, observing oneself from outside

**Example**: "I feel like I'm watching myself from above", "I don't feel real", "I feel like a robot"

**Causes**: Anxiety, panic attacks, depression, dissociative disorders, PTSD, substances (cannabis, ketamine)

---

### Derealization

**Derealization** = Feeling that world is unreal, dreamlike, distant

**Example**: "Everything feels like a dream", "The world doesn't feel real"

**Causes**: Similar to depersonalization

---

### Documentation Examples - Perception

- "Perception: No hallucinations, illusions, depersonalization, or derealization elicited." (Normal)
- "Perception: Auditory hallucinations present - hears male voice saying 'You're useless, you should die' (second-person, command hallucinations). Denies visual hallucinations." (Depression with psychotic features, schizophrenia)
- "Perception: Visual hallucinations - seeing spiders crawling on walls. Denies auditory hallucinations." (Delirium, substance withdrawal)
- "Perception: Depersonalization - 'I feel detached from myself, like I'm watching myself from outside'. No hallucinations." (Anxiety, dissociative disorder)

---

## 7. COGNITION

**Cognitive function** = Memory, attention, orientation, concentration

**Screening tools**:
- **MMSE** (Mini-Mental State Examination) - 30 points, <24 suggests cognitive impairment
- **MoCA** (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) - 30 points, more sensitive for mild cognitive impairment, <26 abnormal
- **AMT** (Abbreviated Mental Test) - 10 points, quick screen

**When to assess formally**: Suspected dementia, delirium, cognitive impairment

### Orientation

**Assess orientation to**:
1. **Time**: "What's the date today?" (day, month, year)
2. **Place**: "Where are you now?" (building, suburb, city)
3. **Person**: "What's your name?" (own name - rarely impaired unless severe dementia, delirium)

**Scoring**:
- Fully oriented to time, place, and person (normal)
- Disoriented to time (mild - common in hospital admission)
- Disoriented to place (moderate - delirium, dementia)
- Disoriented to person (severe - severe dementia, delirium)

---

### Attention and Concentration

**Tests**:

**Serial 7s**:
- "Starting from 100, subtract 7, and keep subtracting 7."
- 100, 93, 86, 79, 72, 65 (correct sequence)
- **Impaired**: Multiple errors, can't complete task
- **Confounders**: Poor education, dyscalculia, anxiety

**Spell WORLD backwards**:
- D-L-R-O-W (correct)
- Less dependent on education than serial 7s

**Months backwards**:
- December, November, October, September, August... (correct)

**Digit Span**:
- Repeat increasing sequences of numbers (forward: 2-4-7, backward: 9-5-1)
- Normal: ≥5 digits forward, ≥3 digits backward

**Impaired in**: Delirium, dementia, depression (pseudodementia - impaired concentration, not memory), ADHD, anxiety (poor concentration when anxious)

---

### Memory

**Types**:

**Immediate Recall** (registration):
- "I'm going to say 3 words. Please repeat them: Apple, Table, Penny"
- Patient repeats immediately
- **Impaired**: Severe dementia, delirium, inattention

**Short-Term Memory** (recent):
- After 5 minutes: "Can you recall those 3 words I asked you to remember?"
- Normal: Recalls 3/3
- **Impaired**: Dementia (especially Alzheimer's - hallmark is short-term memory loss), delirium, depression (pseudodementia)

**Long-Term Memory** (remote):
- "Where were you born? What was your first job? What significant historical events do you remember?"
- **Impaired**: Severe dementia (remote memory usually preserved until late), Korsakoff syndrome (alcohol-related brain damage)

---

### Executive Function

**Executive function** = Planning, abstract thinking, problem-solving

**Tests**:

**Similarities** (abstract thinking):
- "How are an apple and orange alike?" (Both fruits - correct, abstract)
- Concrete answer: "Both round, both edible" (concrete thinking - seen in dementia, schizophrenia, intellectual disability)

**Proverb Interpretation**:
- "What does 'people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones' mean?"
- Abstract: "Don't criticize others if you have faults yourself"
- Concrete: "Glass would break"
- **Impaired**: Schizophrenia, dementia, intellectual disability

**Judgment**:
- "If you found a stamped addressed envelope on the street, what would you do?"
- Good judgment: "Post it" or "Hand it to post office"
- Poor judgment: "Keep it", "Throw it away"

---

### Documentation Examples - Cognition

- "Cognition: Fully oriented to time, place, and person. Attention and concentration intact (serial 7s correct). Memory grossly intact (recalls 3/3 objects after 5 minutes). Formal cognitive testing not performed." (Normal - screening suggests no impairment)
- "Cognition: Disoriented to time and place (thought he was in a hotel, couldn't state date). Attention impaired (unable to complete serial 7s). Short-term memory impaired (recalled 0/3 objects after 5 minutes). Suggests delirium/dementia - formal testing with MMSE indicated." (Delirium, dementia)
- "Cognition: Oriented. Concentration impaired (serial 7s multiple errors) in context of low mood. Memory intact. Consistent with pseudodementia." (Depression)

---

## 8. INSIGHT and JUDGMENT

### Insight

**Insight** = Patient's awareness of having mental illness and need for treatment

**Levels**:

**Full Insight**:
- Recognizes having mental illness
- Understands symptoms are due to illness
- Agrees treatment is needed
- **Example**: "I know I'm depressed and need medication and therapy to get better"

**Partial Insight**:
- Acknowledges something is wrong, but doesn't fully accept mental illness OR doesn't agree with need for treatment
- **Example**: "I'm having a hard time, but I don't think I have depression. I think it's just stress and I'll be fine without medication."

**No Insight**:
- Doesn't believe anything is wrong
- **Example**: "There's nothing wrong with me. The voices are real. I don't need help."
- **Common in**: Psychosis, mania, some personality disorders

**Assessing Insight**:
- "What do you think is causing how you're feeling?"
- "Do you think you have a mental health condition?"
- "Do you think you need treatment?"

---

### Judgment

**Judgment** = Ability to make sound decisions

**Assess through**:
- History: Recent decisions patient has made (risky sexual behavior, spending sprees, illegal activity)
- Hypothetical scenarios: "If you found a stamped addressed envelope, what would you do?"

**Impaired in**: Mania (poor judgment → risky behavior), dementia, substance use, psychosis, frontal lobe pathology, intellectual disability

---

### Documentation Examples

- "Insight: Full - patient recognizes having depression and agrees with need for treatment. Judgment: Intact." (Good insight, likely to engage with treatment)
- "Insight: Partial - patient acknowledges low mood but doesn't believe needs medication. Judgment: Intact." (May be reluctant to take medication)
- "Insight: Poor - patient doesn't believe he is unwell, states voices are real and doesn't need treatment. Judgment: Impaired (recent risky behavior including aggressive confrontation with police)." (Psychosis - may need involuntary treatment)

## Putting It All Together: MSE Documentation Examples

### Example 1: Major Depressive Disorder

**MSE**:
- **Appearance**: 45-year-old woman appearing stated age, casually dressed, poor grooming (hair unkempt), no eye contact.
- **Behavior**: Minimal eye contact, psychomotor retardation noted (slow movements, long pauses). Cooperative but withdrawn. No abnormal movements observed.
- **Speech**: Reduced rate, volume, and quantity. Increased latency before responses. Monotone.
- **Mood**: "Terrible" (patient's words).
- **Affect**: Low mood, restricted range, congruent with mood and thought content.
- **Thought Form**: Linear and goal-directed, no formal thought disorder.
- **Thought Content**: Themes of guilt and worthlessness. Passive suicidal ideation present ("wish I could go to sleep and not wake up"), no active plan or intent. No delusions or obsessions.
- **Perception**: No hallucinations, illusions, depersonalization, or derealization elicited.
- **Cognition**: Oriented. Concentration impaired (serial 7s multiple errors). Memory grossly intact. Consistent with depression-related pseudodementia.
- **Insight**: Full - recognizes depression, agrees with need for treatment.

### Example 2: Schizophrenia (Psychosis)

**MSE**:
- **Appearance**: 28-year-old male appearing older than stated age, disheveled, poor hygiene (body odor present, appeared not to have washed recently), wearing sunglasses indoors.
- **Behavior**: Minimal eye contact, guarded and suspicious. Appeared to be responding to internal stimuli (paused mid-sentence, looked to side, tilted head as if listening). Poor rapport.
- **Speech**: Normal rate and volume. Reduced quantity, guarded responses.
- **Mood**: "Fine" (incongruent with presentation).
- **Affect**: Flat (minimal emotional expression), incongruent (smiled when discussing distressing topic).
- **Thought Form**: Loosening of associations (jumps between unrelated topics). Evidence of thought blocking mid-sentence.
- **Thought Content**: Persecutory delusions ("police are following me, listening to my thoughts"). Thought broadcasting ("everyone can hear my thoughts on the radio"). Denies suicidal ideation.
- **Perception**: Auditory hallucinations - reports hearing two male voices providing running commentary on his actions ("he's walking now"). Denies visual hallucinations.
- **Cognition**: Oriented. Attention impaired (could not complete serial 7s). Memory grossly intact.
- **Insight**: Poor - doesn't believe he is unwell, states voices and delusions are real.

---

### Example 3: Mania (Bipolar Disorder Type I)

**MSE**:
- **Appearance**: 35-year-old male appearing stated age, wearing brightly colored mismatched clothing, excessive jewelry. Well-groomed but flamboyant presentation.
- **Behavior**: Overfamiliar (addressed examiner by first name, invaded personal space). Distractible (attention drawn to objects in room). Overactive, restless, pacing.
- **Speech**: Pressured (rapid, loud, difficult to interrupt). Increased quantity.
- **Mood**: "Fantastic! Never been better! I feel amazing!" (patient's words).
- **Affect**: Elevated and euphoric. Full range but predominantly elevated. Labile (rapidly shifted to irritability when challenged). Congruent with mood.
- **Thought Form**: Flight of ideas (rapid jumping between topics with discernible connections - rhyming, punning).
- **Thought Content**: Grandiose delusions ("I have special powers, I can communicate with God"). Denies suicidal ideation (but mixed episodes can have suicidal ideation - assess carefully).
- **Perception**: Mood-congruent auditory hallucinations (hears God speaking to him). No visual hallucinations.
- **Cognition**: Oriented. Concentration impaired due to distractibility. Memory intact.
- **Insight**: Poor - doesn't believe he is unwell, states he feels "better than ever" and doesn't need treatment.

## Common IMG Mistakes in MSE

### Mistake 1: Confusing Mood and Affect

**Problem**: Documenting "Mood: Appears low" (incorrect - this is affect, not mood)

**Why It's Wrong**:
- **Mood** = Subjective (patient's words)
- **Affect** = Objective (your observation)

**Correct Approach**:
- **Mood**: "Low" (patient's words in quotes) OR "3/10" (if rated on scale)
- **Affect**: Low mood, restricted range, congruent

---

### Mistake 2: Not Documenting Absence of Findings

**Problem**: Only documenting positive findings, not stating what was absent

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Medicolegal risk - did you assess for hallucinations, suicidal ideation, or just didn't document?

**Correct Approach**:
- Document negative findings: "No hallucinations, delusions, or suicidal ideation elicited"
- Especially important: Suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, hallucinations, delusions

---

### Mistake 3: Not Integrating MSE with History

**Problem**: MSE findings don't match history (history suggests depression, but MSE shows normal mood)

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Inconsistent findings = Red flag (patient hiding symptoms, malingering, or history incorrect)

**Correct Approach**:
- MSE should SUPPORT history
- If inconsistent, explore: "You mentioned feeling depressed for weeks, but today you seem in good spirits. Can you tell me more?"

---

### Mistake 4: Using Vague Descriptions

**Problem**: "Patient appears sad" (too vague)

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Not descriptive enough for another clinician to understand presentation

**Correct Approach**:
- Be specific: "Affect: Low mood, reduced eye contact, tearful at times, restricted range, psychomotor retardation noted"

---

### Mistake 5: Not Assessing Cognition When Indicated

**Problem**: Patient disoriented, confused, but no formal cognitive assessment documented

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Cognitive impairment (delirium, dementia) needs formal assessment
- Medicolegal risk

**Correct Approach**:
- If ANY cognitive concern (disorientation, memory complaint, older adult with new psychiatric symptoms) → Formal cognitive testing (MMSE, MoCA, AMT)

---

### Mistake 6: Challenging Delusions

**Problem**: "That's not true, the CIA isn't following you"

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Damages rapport
- Patient becomes defensive, guarded, won't disclose further

**Correct Approach**:
- **Don't challenge, don't collude**
- Explore: "Tell me more about that", "How do you know the CIA is following you?"
- Empathize with distress: "That sounds very frightening"

## OSCE Practice Stations

### Station 1: Perform MSE on Patient with Depression

**Scenario**: You are in the Emergency Department. Perform a Mental State Examination on this patient who has presented with low mood. (8 minutes)

**Actor Instructions**: You are 45-year-old woman, depressed. Appear: Unkempt, poor eye contact, speak slowly and quietly, long pauses before answering. Mood: "Terrible". Content: Themes of guilt ("I'm a burden"), passive suicidal ideation ("I wish I could go to sleep and not wake up"). No hallucinations.

**Model Performance**:

**Minutes 0-1: Introduction + Consent**
- "Hello, I'm Dr [Name]. I'd like to assess your current mental state, which involves asking you some questions and observing how you're doing. Is that okay?"

**Minutes 1-2: Appearance, Behavior, Speech (Observe)**
- **Observe**: Unkempt, poor eye contact, slow movements
- **Engage**: "How are you feeling today?" (assess speech: slow, quiet, long latency)

**Minutes 2-3: Mood and Affect**
- "How would you describe your mood?" [Patient: "Terrible"]
- Observe affect: Low, restricted range, congruent

**Minutes 3-5: Thought Form and Content**
- "What's been on your mind recently?" [Patient: "I feel like a burden to everyone, I've let everyone down"]
- "Do you ever feel life isn't worth living?" [Patient: "Yes, I wish I could go to sleep and not wake up"]
- "Do you have thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life?" [Patient: "I think about it, but I wouldn't do it"]
- "Have you ever tried to harm yourself?" [No]

**Minutes 5-6: Perception**
- "Do you ever hear things others don't hear, like voices?" [No]
- "Do you ever see things others don't see?" [No]

**Minutes 6-7: Cognition**
- "Do you know what day it is today?" [Yes, correct]
- "Do you know where you are?" [Yes, hospital]
- "I'm going to say 3 words - apple, table, penny. Please repeat them." [Repeats correctly]
- "Can you subtract 7 from 100, and keep subtracting?" [Attempts, makes errors - poor concentration]
- [After 5 minutes]: "Can you recall those 3 words?" [Recalls 3/3 - memory intact]

**Minutes 7-8: Insight**
- "What do you think is causing how you're feeling?" [Patient: "I think I'm depressed"]
- "Do you think you need help?" [Yes]

**Document MSE** (as shown in Example 1 above)

## Summary: Key Takeaways for MSE

### 1. MSE = Snapshot of Current Mental State
- Objective assessment during interview
- Different from history (longitudinal account)

### 2. Systematic Framework: ABC STAMP
- Appearance, Behavior, Cognition, Speech, Thought, Affect/Mood, Perception, Plus Insight

### 3. Mood vs Affect
- Mood = Subjective (patient's words)
- Affect = Objective (your observation: type, range, congruence, reactivity)

### 4. Thought: Form and Content
- Form = HOW patient thinks (linear, tangential, flight of ideas, loosening of associations)
- Content = WHAT patient thinks (delusions, obsessions, suicidal ideation)

### 5. Visual Hallucinations = Organic Until Proven Otherwise
- Delirium, dementia, substances more likely than schizophrenia

### 6. Assess Cognition Formally if Any Concern
- Orientation, attention, memory
- MMSE, MoCA, AMT

### 7. MSE Should Match History
- If depression history → Expect low mood, psychomotor retardation, poor concentration
- If psychosis history → Expect hallucinations, delusions, flat affect
- Inconsistency = Red flag

### 8. Always Document Negative Findings
- "No hallucinations, delusions, or suicidal ideation" (medicolegal protection)

### 9. Don't Challenge Delusions
- Explore, empathize with distress, don't collude or confront

### 10. Common IMG Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Confusing mood and affect
- ❌ Not documenting negative findings
- ❌ MSE not matching history
- ❌ Vague descriptions
- ❌ Not assessing cognition when indicated
- ❌ Challenging delusions
