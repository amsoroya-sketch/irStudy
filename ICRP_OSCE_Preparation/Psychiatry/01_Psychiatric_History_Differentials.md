## Dr. Amir Soufi's Principle Applied to Psychiatry

> **"In psychiatry, your differential forms from the FIRST symptom: Low mood = Depression vs bipolar (depressed phase) vs adjustment disorder vs grief vs organic (hypothyroid, medication). Anxiety = GAD vs panic disorder vs PTSD vs substance withdrawal vs cardiac (MI, arrhythmia). Psychosis = Schizophrenia vs drug-induced vs affective psychosis (bipolar, depression with psychotic features) vs delirium vs organic (brain tumor, encephalitis). ALWAYS rule out ORGANIC causes and SUBSTANCE use FIRST - medical illnesses and drugs can mimic ANY psychiatric disorder."**

### The Psychiatric Differential Mindset

**Traditional Approach**:
- Take full psychiatric history systematically
- Perform mental state examination
- At end, formulate diagnosis
- **Problem**: Misses medical causes (hypothyroidism presenting as depression, delirium presenting as psychosis), delays treatment, fails to integrate risk assessment

**Dr. Amir's Differential-Driven Approach**:

1. **From First Symptom: Generate Differential**
   - **Low mood** → Think immediately: Major depression, bipolar depression, adjustment disorder, grief, hypothyroidism, medications (beta-blockers, steroids), chronic illness
   - **Anxiety** → Think immediately: GAD, panic disorder, PTSD, substance withdrawal (alcohol, benzodiazepines), hyperthyroidism, cardiac (MI, arrhythmia), caffeine excess
   - **Psychosis** (hallucinations, delusions) → Think immediately: Schizophrenia, drug-induced (amphetamines, cannabis, steroids), affective psychosis (bipolar mania with psychosis, depression with psychotic features), delirium, organic (brain tumor, encephalitis, SLE)
   - **Mania** (elevated mood, increased energy) → Think immediately: Bipolar disorder type I, drug-induced (amphetamines, steroids, antidepressants), hyperthyroidism, organic (frontal lobe tumor)

2. **Rule Out Organic FIRST**
   - Medical illnesses can present with psychiatric symptoms
   - **ALWAYS ask**: Physical health, medications, substance use, recent medical investigations
   - **Red flags for organic cause**:
     - New-onset psychiatric symptoms in older adult (>65 years)
     - Acute onset (hours-days)
     - Fluctuating course (delirium)
     - Visual hallucinations (organic until proven otherwise)
     - Neurological signs (confusion, disorientation, memory impairment, seizures)
     - No psychiatric history

3. **Integrate Risk Assessment Throughout**
   - Risk assessment is NOT a separate section at the end
   - Ask about suicidal thoughts when discussing low mood
   - Ask about violence/aggression when discussing anger/irritability
   - Ask about self-neglect when discussing functional impairment

4. **Collateral History is ESSENTIAL**
   - Patient may have poor insight (psychosis, mania, dementia)
   - Patient may minimize symptoms (substance use, eating disorder)
   - Patient may be unable to provide history (severe depression, psychosis, confusion)
   - **ALWAYS seek collateral** (family, friends, GP, previous treating team)

---

## The PSYCHIATRIC Framework for History-Taking

**P - Presenting complaint** (in patient's own words)

**S - Symptom exploration** (detailed, using screening tools)

**Y - Years of symptoms** (onset, course, triggers)

**C - Collateral history** (family, friends, previous medical records)

**H - History of psychiatric illness** (diagnoses, hospitalizations, treatments)

**I - Impact on function** (work, relationships, self-care, activities of daily living)

**A - Associated substance use** (alcohol, illicit drugs, prescribed medications, caffeine, nicotine)

**T - Treatment history** (medications, psychotherapy, ECT, admissions)

**R - Risk assessment** (suicide, violence, self-neglect, vulnerability)

**I - Insight and understanding** (patient's view of illness, willingness to engage with treatment)

**C - Co-morbid medical illness** (physical health, medications that may affect mental health)

---

## Opening the Psychiatric Consultation

### Creating a Safe Environment

**Setting**:
- **Private room**, door closed (but not locked - patient should feel they can leave)
- **Seating**: Chairs at 90° angle (not directly opposite - less confrontational), equal height
- **No barriers**: Don't sit behind desk
- **Safety**: Sit nearest to door (your exit route), remove potential weapons from room
- **Time**: Adequate time (minimum 30-45 minutes for initial assessment)

**Introduction** (1-2 minutes):
- "Hello, I'm Dr [Name], one of the doctors here. What should I call you?" [Use patient's preferred name]
- **Explain purpose**: "I'd like to talk with you today about how you've been feeling and what's been going on. This will take about 30-45 minutes. Is that okay?"
- **Confidentiality**: "What we discuss is confidential, but I need to let you know that if I'm concerned about your safety or someone else's safety, I may need to share information with the team."
- **Rapport building**: Open body language, empathic tone, active listening

---

## Step 1: Presenting Complaint

**Open question**:
- "What's brought you in today?"
- "How can I help you?"
- "Tell me what's been happening."

**Listen without interrupting** (1-2 minutes) - let patient tell their story

**Reflect back** (show you're listening):
- "So it sounds like you've been feeling very low in mood for the past few weeks?"
- "You mentioned you've been hearing voices - tell me more about that."

**Document in patient's own words**:
- PC: "I've been feeling really down and I can't see a way out. I just want it to stop." (45-year-old male)

---

## Step 2: Symptom Exploration (Based on Presenting Complaint)

**From the presenting complaint, generate differential and explore symptoms systematically**

---

### LOW MOOD / DEPRESSION

**Immediate Differential**:
1. **Major Depressive Disorder** (MDD)
2. **Bipolar Disorder** (depressive episode)
3. **Adjustment Disorder** (in response to stressor within 3 months)
4. **Persistent Depressive Disorder** (Dysthymia - chronic low mood >2 years)
5. **Grief / Bereavement**
6. **Organic**:
   - Hypothyroidism
   - Medications (beta-blockers, steroids, isotretinoin, interferon)
   - Chronic illnesses (cancer, chronic pain, heart failure)
   - Neurological (stroke, Parkinson's disease, dementia)
7. **Substance-induced**: Alcohol, cannabis withdrawal

---

#### Screening for Depression (DSM-5 Criteria)

**Use the 9 symptoms of depression** (mnemonic: **SIG E CAPS** + depressed mood)

Ask: "Over the past 2 weeks, have you noticed any of the following?"

**S - Sleep disturbance**
- "How's your sleep?"
- **Insomnia**: Difficulty falling asleep (initial insomnia), waking during night (middle insomnia), early morning waking (terminal insomnia - classic in depression)
- **Hypersomnia**: Sleeping excessively (atypical depression)

**I - Interest (loss of) / Anhedonia**
- "Have you lost interest in things you used to enjoy?"
- "Do you still get pleasure from activities?"
- **Anhedonia** = core symptom of depression

**G - Guilt / Worthlessness**
- "Do you feel guilty about things?"
- "How do you feel about yourself?"
- "Do you feel you've let people down?"
- **Pathological guilt** (out of proportion, delusional guilt in severe depression)

**E - Energy (decreased) / Fatigue**
- "How are your energy levels?"
- "Do you feel tired all the time, even after rest?"

**C - Concentration (impaired)**
- "How's your concentration?"
- "Can you focus when reading or watching TV?"
- "Are you able to make decisions?"

**A - Appetite / Weight change**
- "How's your appetite?"
- "Have you lost or gained weight recently?" (>5% body weight in 1 month)
- **Decreased appetite** (typical depression), **increased appetite** (atypical depression)

**P - Psychomotor changes**
- **Agitation**: "Do you feel restless, unable to sit still?"
- **Retardation**: Observe slowness of movement, speech, thought (ask: "Do you feel everything has slowed down?")

**S - Suicidal thoughts** (CRITICAL - ask EVERY patient with low mood)
- See Risk Assessment section below

**Plus: Depressed mood**
- "How would you describe your mood?"
- "Do you feel sad, down, empty, hopeless most of the day, nearly every day?"

---

**DSM-5 Diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder**:
- **5 or more** symptoms present during same 2-week period
- **Must include** (1) depressed mood OR (2) loss of interest/pleasure (anhedonia)
- Symptoms cause significant distress or functional impairment
- Not attributable to substance or medical condition

**Severity**:
- **Mild**: Few symptoms, minor functional impairment
- **Moderate**: Symptoms/functional impairment between mild and severe
- **Severe**: Most symptoms, marked functional impairment, may have psychotic features

---

#### Differentiating Diagnoses

**Bipolar Depression vs Unipolar Depression**:
- **ALWAYS ask about mania/hypomania** in ANY patient presenting with depression
- "Have you ever had periods where your mood was the opposite - where you felt very high, energized, needed less sleep?"
- "Have you ever had periods where you felt 'too good', more confident than usual, spent more money than you should, or got into trouble?"
- **If yes** → Screen for mania (see below)
- **Why this matters**: Antidepressants alone can trigger mania in bipolar disorder → Need mood stabilizer

**Adjustment Disorder**:
- Clear stressor within past 3 months (job loss, relationship breakdown, bereavement)
- Symptoms out of proportion to stressor OR causing significant functional impairment
- Duration: Symptoms resolve within 6 months of stressor ending
- Doesn't meet criteria for MDD

**Grief / Bereavement**:
- Recent loss (death of loved one)
- **Normal grief**: Waves of sadness triggered by reminders, able to experience positive emotions, no pervasive worthlessness/suicidal ideation
- **Complicated grief / MDD**: Persistent, pervasive low mood, anhedonia, guilt/worthlessness not related to deceased, suicidal ideation, functional impairment >2 months
- Can have grief AND depression concurrently

---

6. **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder** (OCD)
7. **Substance-induced**: Caffeine excess, alcohol/benzodiazepine withdrawal, amphetamines, cannabis
8. **Organic**:
   - **Hyperthyroidism** (tremor, heat intolerance, weight loss, palpitations)
   - **Cardiac**: MI, arrhythmias, valvular disease

- "Do you avoid situations where panic attacks have occurred?"

**Panic Disorder** = Recurrent unexpected panic attacks + ≥1 month of:
- Persistent worry about having another panic attack
- Maladaptive change in behavior to avoid attacks (agoraphobia)

---

#### Screening for PTSD

**Ask about trauma** (be sensitive):
- "Have you experienced or witnessed any traumatic events?" (life-threatening, serious injury, sexual violence)

**If yes, screen for PTSD symptoms** (≥1 month duration):

**1. Intrusion symptoms** (re-experiencing):
- "Do you have distressing memories or nightmares about the event?"
- "Do you feel like it's happening again (flashbacks)?"
- "Do you get very upset when reminded of the event?"

**2. Avoidance**:
- "Do you avoid thinking or talking about the event?"
- "Do you avoid places, people, or activities that remind you of it?"

**3. Negative alterations in cognition/mood**:
- "Do you have trouble remembering parts of the event?"
- "Do you blame yourself or others for what happened?"
- "Do you feel detached from others?"
- "Have you lost interest in activities?"

**4. Hyperarousal**:
- "Are you more irritable or angry than before?"
- "Do you feel on guard or easily startled?"
- "Do you have trouble concentrating or sleeping?"

---

#### Differentiating Anxiety Disorders

| Disorder | Key Discriminator |
|----------|------------------|
| **GAD** | Excessive worry about MULTIPLE domains, ≥6 months, difficult to control |
| **Panic Disorder** | Recurrent UNEXPECTED panic attacks, worry about future attacks, avoidance |
| **Social Anxiety** | Fear/anxiety specific to SOCIAL situations (public speaking, eating in public, meeting new people), fear of negative evaluation |
| **Specific Phobia** | Fear/anxiety specific to ONE object/situation (heights, spiders, flying, blood/needles) |
| **PTSD** | Trauma history, intrusion symptoms (flashbacks, nightmares), avoidance, hyperarousal ≥1 month |
| **OCD** | Obsessions (intrusive thoughts) + Compulsions (repetitive behaviors to reduce anxiety) |

---

### PSYCHOSIS (Hallucinations, Delusions, Disorganized Thinking)

**Immediate Differential**:
1. **Schizophrenia** (chronic, >6 months)
2. **Schizophreniform Disorder** (1-6 months)
3. **Brief Psychotic Disorder** (<1 month)
4. **Drug-Induced Psychosis**: Amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine, synthetic cannabinoids ("spice"), steroids, L-DOPA
5. **Affective Psychosis**:
   - Bipolar disorder with psychotic features (mania or depression)
   - Major depression with psychotic features
6. **Delirium** (acute confusional state - fluctuating consciousness, inattention, disorientation)
7. **Organic**:
   - Brain tumor, stroke, encephalitis, SLE, HIV, syphilis (neurosyphilis)
   - Temporal lobe epilepsy (complex partial seizures - may have olfactory/gustatory hallucinations)
   - Dementia (Lewy body dementia - visual hallucinations)

---

#### Screening for Psychotic Symptoms

**Hallucinations** (perception without external stimulus):

**Auditory** (most common in schizophrenia):
- "Do you ever hear things that other people don't hear?"
- "Do you hear voices when no one is around?"
- **If yes**: "How many voices? Male or female? What do they say?"
  - **Running commentary**: Voices commenting on patient's actions
  - **Third-person**: Voices talking about patient ("He's stupid", "She's going to hurt herself")
  - **Command hallucinations**: Voices telling patient to do things → **Risk assessment needed** (What do they tell you to do? Do you feel compelled to obey?)

**Visual** (more common in organic psychosis, delirium, Lewy body dementia):
- "Do you see things that others don't see?"
- **Red flag**: New-onset visual hallucinations → Think organic cause, delirium

**Olfactory/Gustatory** (smell/taste - temporal lobe epilepsy, brain tumor):
- "Do you smell or taste unusual things that others don't?"

**Tactile** (touch - formication in cocaine/amphetamine use, alcohol withdrawal):
- "Do you feel sensations on your skin like bugs crawling?"

**Delusions** (fixed, false beliefs not shared by cultural/religious group):

**Screening questions**:
- "Do you have any beliefs that others find unusual?"
- "Do you feel people are trying to harm you or plot against you?" (Persecutory delusion)
- "Do you feel you have special powers or abilities?" (Grandiose delusion)
- "Do you feel people are sending you special messages through TV/radio/internet?" (Ideas of reference)
- "Do you feel your thoughts are being controlled by an outside force?" (Thought insertion, withdrawal, broadcasting - first-rank symptoms of schizophrenia)

**Types of delusions**:
- **Persecutory**: Being followed, spied on, poisoned, plotted against (most common)
- **Grandiose**: Special powers, wealth, identity (e.g., "I'm the son of God")
- **Referential**: Events have special personal significance (e.g., "TV news is about me")
- **Erotomanic**: False belief that someone (usually higher status) is in love with patient
- **Nihilistic**: Belief that self, others, or world doesn't exist or is about to end
- **Somatic**: Belief about body (e.g., "I have cancer", "Worms are eating my brain")

**Disorganized thinking** (assess through speech):
- Tangential (goes off-topic, doesn't return)
- Circumstantial (eventually gets to point, but very indirect)
- Loose associations (knight's move thinking - jumps between unrelated topics)
- Word salad (incomprehensible speech)
- Neologisms (made-up words)

---

#### Differentiating Psychotic Disorders

**Schizophrenia** (DSM-5 criteria):
- **≥2 symptoms** (for significant portion of 1 month), at least one must be (1), (2), or (3):
  1. Delusions
  2. Hallucinations
  3. Disorganized speech
  4. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior
  5. Negative symptoms (flat affect, avolition, alogia, anhedonia)
- **Duration**: ≥6 months (including prodrome, residual symptoms)
- **Functional decline**: Work, relationships, self-care
- Rule out substance, medical condition

**Drug-Induced Psychosis**:
- Clear temporal relationship to substance use (within hours-days of use)
- Resolves within days-weeks of stopping substance
- Common drugs: Amphetamines, cannabis (esp. high-THC strains), cocaine, synthetic cannabinoids, steroids

**Delirium** (vs psychosis):
- **Acute onset** (hours-days)
- **Fluctuating consciousness**, worse at night (sundowning)
- **Inattention** (cannot focus, easily distracted)
- **Disorientation** (time, place, person)
- **Reversible** (treat underlying cause)

---

### MANIA (Elevated Mood, Increased Energy)

**Immediate Differential**:
1. **Bipolar Disorder Type I** (mania)
2. **Bipolar Disorder Type II** (hypomania)
3. **Drug-Induced**: Amphetamines, cocaine, steroids, antidepressants (can trigger mania in bipolar)
4. **Organic**: Hyperthyroidism, frontal lobe tumor/stroke, SLE, HIV

---

#### Screening for Mania

**Core symptoms**: Elevated, expansive, or irritable mood + increased energy/activity for ≥1 week (mania) or ≥4 days (hypomania)

**DIG FAST** mnemonic (≥3 needed):

**D - Distractibility**
- "Do you find your thoughts jumping from one thing to another?"

**I - Irresponsibility / Indiscretion**
- Excessive involvement in pleasurable activities with potential for painful consequences
- "Have you done things recently that are out of character? Spent money you don't have? Had risky sexual encounters?"

**G - Grandiosity**
- "Do you feel more confident than usual?"
- "Do you feel you have special powers or abilities?"

**F - Flight of ideas**
- Racing thoughts
- "Do your thoughts race? Do you have so many ideas you can't keep up?"

**A - Activity increase / Agitation**
- Increased goal-directed activity (work, social, sexual)
- Psychomotor agitation

**S - Sleep (decreased need)**
- "How much sleep are you getting?"
- "Do you feel rested after only a few hours of sleep?" (not insomnia - genuinely need less sleep)

**T - Talkativeness**
- Pressured speech (rapid, difficult to interrupt)
- Observe: Is patient talking excessively, rapidly, loudly?

---

**Mania vs Hypomania**:
| Feature | Mania | Hypomania |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Duration | ≥7 days | ≥4 days |
| Severity | Marked impairment in function, may require hospitalization, may have psychotic features | No marked impairment, no psychotic features, no hospitalization |
| Diagnosis | Bipolar I | Bipolar II |

**Mixed Episode**: Features of both mania AND depression simultaneously (e.g., elevated mood + suicidal thoughts, or depressed mood + racing thoughts, increased energy)

---

## Step 3: Years of Symptoms (Onset, Course, Triggers)

**Onset**:
- "When did you first notice these symptoms?"
- "Was there anything happening in your life at that time?" (Triggers: stressors, life events, trauma)

**Course**:
- **First episode** vs **Recurrent**
- **Continuous** vs **Episodic** (periods of wellness between episodes)
- **Getting better, worse, or staying the same?**

**Triggers**:
- Life events (job loss, relationship breakdown, bereavement, trauma)
- Seasonal pattern (seasonal affective disorder - depression in winter)
- Menstrual cycle (premenstrual dysphoric disorder)

**Previous similar episodes**:
- "Have you felt like this before?"
- **If yes**: "How many times? What helped? What didn't help?"

---

## Step 4: Collateral History

**Why Essential in Psychiatry**:
- Patient may lack insight (psychosis, mania, dementia)
- Patient may minimize (substance use, eating disorder)
- Patient may be unable to provide history (severe depression, psychosis, confusion)

**Sources**:
- Family, friends, partner
- GP (previous medical records, medications)
- Previous treating psychiatrist/psychologist
- Hospital records (previous admissions)

**How to Obtain**:
- **With patient's consent** (if patient has capacity)
- **Without consent** if patient lacks capacity OR safety concern (risk to self/others)

**What to Ask Collateral**:
- "What changes have you noticed in [patient's] behavior/mood?"
- "How long have you noticed these changes?"
- "Have you noticed any triggers?"
- "Any substance use you're aware of?"
- "Any concerns about safety (suicide, violence, self-neglect)?"
- "What was [patient] like before this episode?" (Baseline functioning)

---

## Step 5: History of Psychiatric Illness

**Previous diagnoses**:
- "Have you been diagnosed with any mental health conditions before?"
- "Depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, PTSD, eating disorder?"

**Previous hospitalizations**:
- "Have you been admitted to a psychiatric unit before?"
- **If yes**: "How many times? When was the most recent? How long? Voluntary or involuntary?"

**Previous treatments**:
- See Step 7 below

---

## Step 6: Impact on Function (Work, Relationships, Self-care)

**Work/Study**:
- "Are you working/studying?"
- "How have your symptoms affected your work/study?"
- "Have you had time off? Lost your job?"

**Relationships**:
- "How are your relationships with family/friends/partner?"
- "Have your symptoms affected these relationships?"

**Self-care**:
- "How are you managing day-to-day tasks?"
- "Are you eating regularly? Showering? Leaving the house?"
- **Severe depression**: Patient may be bed-bound, not eating, not washing

**Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)**:
- "Can you cook, clean, manage finances, shop for groceries?"

**Social activities**:
- "What do you do for fun?"
- "Have you withdrawn from activities you used to enjoy?"

---

## Step 7: Associated Substance Use

**CRITICAL**: Substance use can CAUSE or EXACERBATE psychiatric symptoms

**Alcohol**:
- "Do you drink alcohol? How much per week?"
- **AUDIT-C** (quick screen):
  1. "How often do you have a drink containing alcohol?" (0 = Never to 4 = 4+ times/week)
  2. "How many standard drinks do you have on a typical day?" (0 = 1-2 to 4 = 10+)
  3. "How often do you have 6 or more standard drinks on one occasion?" (0 = Never to 4 = Daily)
  - Score ≥4 (men) or ≥3 (women) = Possible alcohol use disorder
- **Standard drink in Australia**: 10g alcohol = 100mL wine, 30mL spirits, 285mL beer

**Illicit drugs**:
- "Do you use any recreational drugs?"
- **Non-judgmental tone**, normalize: "Many people use substances to cope with stress. I need to ask to give you the best care."
- Ask specifically: Cannabis, amphetamines (ice, speed), cocaine, MDMA (ecstasy), heroin, synthetic drugs

**Prescription medications**:
- "Are you taking any medications prescribed by a doctor?"
- **Benzodiazepines** (diazepam, alprazolam): Dependence, withdrawal
- **Opioids** (oxycodone, codeine): Dependence, misuse
- **Stimulants** (dexamphetamine for ADHD): Misuse potential

**Caffeine**:
- "How much coffee/energy drinks do you have per day?"
- Excessive caffeine (>400mg/day = 4 cups coffee) → Anxiety, palpitations, insomnia

**Nicotine**:
- "Do you smoke? How many per day?"
- Smoking rates higher in psychiatric patients

**Dependence screen** (if substance use identified):
- "Have you tried to cut down but couldn't?"
- "Do you need more to get the same effect?" (Tolerance)
- "Do you get withdrawal symptoms when you stop?" (Withdrawal)
- "Does it interfere with your life?" (Work, relationships, legal problems)

---

## Step 8: Treatment History

**Medications**:
- "Have you tried any medications for your mental health?"
- **If yes**: "Which ones? What dose? How long? Did they help? Any side effects? Why did you stop?"
- **Document**: Previous antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, MAOIs), antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines

**Psychotherapy**:
- "Have you seen a psychologist or counselor?"
- **If yes**: "What type of therapy? (CBT, DBT, psychodynamic) How long? Was it helpful?"

**ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy)**:
- "Have you ever had ECT?"
- **Used for**: Severe depression (especially with psychotic features), catatonia, treatment-resistant mania

**Hospitalizations**:
- Number, duration, voluntary vs involuntary (Mental Health Act)

**Current treatment**:
- "Are you taking any medications currently?"
- "Are you seeing a psychiatrist, psychologist, or counselor?"

---

## Step 9: Risk Assessment (Integrated Throughout History)

**CRITICAL**: Risk assessment is NOT a separate section at the end - integrate throughout consultation

### Suicide Risk

**Screen ALL patients with depression, anxiety, psychosis, substance use**

**Graduated approach** (start gently, become more specific):

**Level 1: Hopelessness**
- "How do you see the future?"
- "Do you feel hopeless?" (Strong predictor of suicide)

**Level 2: Passive suicidal ideation**
- "Do you ever feel life isn't worth living?"
- "Do you ever wish you could go to sleep and not wake up?"

**Level 3: Active suicidal ideation**
- "Do you have thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life?"
- **If yes** → Assess severity:
  - **Frequency**: "How often do you have these thoughts?"
  - **Intent**: "Do you intend to act on these thoughts?"
  - **Plan**: "Have you thought about how you would do it?" (Specific plan = higher risk)
  - **Access to means**: "Do you have access to [method]?" (e.g., tablets, rope, firearms)
  - **Timeline**: "When are you planning to do this?"
  - **Protective factors**: "What's stopped you so far?" (Family, pets, religious beliefs, fear of pain)

**Level 4: Suicide attempts**
- "Have you ever tried to harm yourself or attempt suicide?"
- **If yes**: "When? How? What happened? Did you receive medical treatment?"
- **Recent attempt** = HIGH RISK

**Level 5: Self-harm (non-suicidal)**
- "Do you harm yourself in other ways?" (Cutting, burning, head-banging)
- Differentiate: **Non-suicidal self-harm** (to relieve emotional pain, no intent to die) vs **Suicide attempt** (intent to die)

---

**Risk Factors for Suicide** (SAD PERSONS):

**S - Sex** (Male > Female for completed suicide, though females have higher attempt rate)
**A - Age** (<25 or >65)
**D - Depression** (especially severe, with hopelessness, psychotic features)
**P - Previous attempts** (strongest predictor)
**E - Ethanol/substance use**
**R - Rational thinking loss** (psychosis, impulsivity)
**S - Social support lacking** (isolated, divorced, bereaved)
**O - Organized plan** (specific, lethal method, access to means)
**N - No spouse** (single, divorced, widowed)
**S - Sickness** (chronic illness, chronic pain, terminal illness)

**Immediate risk (requires urgent intervention)**:
- Current suicidal ideation + intent + plan + access to means
- Recent suicide attempt
- Command hallucinations telling patient to harm self
- Severe hopelessness, agitation
- Intoxication
- No protective factors

**Management of immediate risk**:
- **Do not leave patient alone**
- **Remove means** (medications, sharps, ligature points)
- **Psychiatric assessment** urgently (psychiatry team, Crisis Assessment Team)
- **Consider involuntary admission** (Mental Health Act - see later)

---

### Violence Risk

**Screen if**: History of violence, forensic history, current anger/irritability, paranoid delusions, command hallucinations

**Questions**:
- "Do you ever feel angry or aggressive?"
- "Have you ever hurt someone else?"
- "Do you have thoughts of harming anyone?"
- **If yes**: "Who? Why? Do you have a plan? Access to weapons?"

**Risk factors**:
- Previous violence (strongest predictor)
- Substance use (alcohol, amphetamines)
- Psychosis (especially paranoid delusions, command hallucinations)
- Antisocial personality disorder
- Male gender
- Young age

**Management**:
- Ensure safety (staff, other patients, self)
- **De-escalation** (calm tone, non-threatening posture, offer food/drink, negotiate)
- **Medications** (IM antipsychotic, benzodiazepine if needed)
- **Seclusion/restraint** (last resort, documented, reviewed regularly)

---

### Self-Neglect / Vulnerability

**Screen if**: Severe depression, psychosis, dementia, eating disorder, homelessness

**Questions**:
- "Are you eating regularly?"
- "Are you taking care of yourself - showering, changing clothes?"
- "Where are you living? Do you have stable housing?"

**Risk factors**:
- Severe mental illness (catatonia, severe depression, dementia)
- Homelessness
- Financial exploitation
- Physical health problems (diabetes, wounds)

**Management**:
- **Social work referral**
- **Community mental health team** (home visits, medication supervision)
- **Guardian** (if lacks capacity for self-care)

---

## Step 10: Insight and Understanding

**Insight** = Patient's awareness of having mental illness and need for treatment

**Ask**:
- "What do you think is causing how you're feeling?"
- "Do you think you have a mental health condition?"
- "Do you think you need treatment?"

**Levels of insight**:
- **Full insight**: "I have depression and need treatment"
- **Partial insight**: "I'm not well but I don't think it's mental illness / I don't think I need medication"
- **No insight**: "There's nothing wrong with me, I don't need help" (common in psychosis, mania)

**Capacity to consent to treatment**:
- Can patient understand information, retain it, weigh options, communicate decision?
- **If lacks capacity** → May need involuntary treatment (Mental Health Act)

---

## Step 11: Co-morbid Medical Illness

**ALWAYS ask about physical health**:
- "Do you have any medical conditions?"
- Chronic illnesses: Diabetes, heart disease, cancer, chronic pain, HIV, hepatitis C
- **Bidirectional relationship**: Physical illness → depression; depression → poor medical outcomes

**Medications**:
- "What medications do you take?" (including over-the-counter, herbal)
- **Medications that can cause/worsen psychiatric symptoms**:
  - **Depression**: Beta-blockers, steroids, isotretinoin, interferon, some anticonvulsants
  - **Anxiety**: Stimulants, bronchodilators (salbutamol), thyroid hormones
  - **Psychosis**: Steroids, L-DOPA, high-dose steroids
  - **Mania**: Steroids, antidepressants (in bipolar)

**Recent medical investigations**:
- "Have you had any blood tests or scans recently?"
- Especially if new-onset psychiatric symptoms → May need investigations to rule out organic cause

---

## Organic Causes of Psychiatric Symptoms (Red Flags)

**When to suspect organic cause**:
- **New-onset psychiatric symptoms** in older adult (>65 years)
- **Acute onset** (hours-days)
- **Fluctuating course**
- **Visual hallucinations** (more common in organic than functional psychosis)
- **Neurological signs** (confusion, disorientation, memory impairment, seizures, focal neurology)
- **No psychiatric history**
- **Treatment-resistant** (doesn't respond to standard psychiatric treatment)

---

**Investigations to Consider** (if organic cause suspected):

**Bedside**:
- **Blood glucose** (hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia)
- **Urine drug screen** (amphetamines, cannabis, benzodiazepines, opioids)

**Blood tests**:
- **FBC** (anemia, infection)
- **U&E** (hyponatremia → confusion, psychosis)
- **LFTs** (hepatic encephalopathy)
- **TFTs** (hyperthyroidism → anxiety, mania; hypothyroidism → depression)
- **Calcium** (hypercalcemia → confusion, depression)
- **Vitamin B12, folate** (deficiency → depression, cognitive impairment)
- **CRP** (infection, inflammation)
- **Syphilis serology** (neurosyphilis)
- **HIV** (HIV encephalopathy)

**Imaging**:
- **CT head** (stroke, tumor, bleed)
- **MRI brain** (more sensitive - encephalitis, dementia, MS, tumor)

**Other**:
- **EEG** (seizures - temporal lobe epilepsy can present with psychosis)
- **Lumbar puncture** (if encephalitis, meningitis suspected)

**Voluntary vs Involuntary**:
- Most psychiatric admissions are **voluntary** (patient consents)
- Involuntary only if meets criteria above

---

## Common IMG Mistakes in Psychiatric History-Taking

### Mistake 1: Not Ruling Out Organic Causes

**Problem**: Assuming all psychiatric symptoms are functional (primary psychiatric illness), not asking about physical health, medications, substance use

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Medical illnesses can present with psychiatric symptoms (hypothyroidism → depression, hyperthyroidism → anxiety, brain tumor → psychosis)
- Medications can cause symptoms (steroids → psychosis/mania)
- Substance use can mimic psychiatric disorders (amphetamines → psychosis, alcohol withdrawal → anxiety/seizures)
- Missing organic cause → Delays appropriate treatment, medicolegal risk

**Correct Approach**:
- **ALWAYS ask**: "Do you have any medical conditions? What medications do you take? Do you use alcohol or drugs?"
- **Red flags for organic**: New-onset in older adult, acute onset, visual hallucinations, neurological signs
- **Investigate if suspected**: Bloods (FBC, U&E, TFTs, B12, glucose), imaging (CT/MRI brain)

---

### Mistake 2: Not Asking About Suicidal Thoughts

**Problem**: Afraid to ask about suicide, worry it will "plant the idea"

**Why It's Wrong**:
- **Asking about suicide does NOT increase risk** - research shows it REDUCES distress
- **Suicide is leading cause of death** in young adults in Australia
- Failing to ask → Miss high-risk patient → Preventable death
- **Medicolegal risk**: If patient dies by suicide and you didn't ask/document

**Correct Approach**:
- **ALWAYS screen for suicidal thoughts** in patients with depression, anxiety, psychosis, substance use
- Use graduated approach (hopelessness → passive → active → plan → attempt)
- **Document thoroughly**: "Denies current suicidal ideation, no plan, no recent attempts. Identified protective factors: supportive family, religious beliefs."

---

### Mistake 3: Not Seeking Collateral History

**Problem**: Relying solely on patient's account, not contacting family/GP/previous treating team

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Patient may lack insight (psychosis, mania), minimize (substance use), or be unable to provide history (severe depression, confusion)
- Collateral provides crucial information (baseline functioning, triggers, previous treatments, substance use)
- Missing information → Inaccurate diagnosis, inappropriate treatment

**Correct Approach**:
- **ALWAYS seek collateral** in psychiatric presentations
- With patient's consent (or without if lacks capacity/safety concern)
- Ask family: "What changes have you noticed? How long? Any substance use? Safety concerns?"

---

### Mistake 4: Not Screening for Bipolar in Depression

**Problem**: Patient presents with depression, you diagnose MDD without asking about mania/hypomania

**Why It's Wrong**:
- **~20% of patients with depression have bipolar disorder**
- Antidepressants alone in bipolar → Can trigger mania/rapid cycling
- Need mood stabilizer (lithium, valproate, antipsychotic) not just antidepressant

**Correct Approach**:
- **ALWAYS ask about mania/hypomania** in ANY patient with depression:
  - "Have you ever had periods where your mood was the opposite - very high, energized, needed less sleep?"
- Screen with DIG FAST if yes

---

### Mistake 5: Using Medical Jargon

**Problem**: "You have anhedonia with neurovegetative symptoms and psychomotor retardation"

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Patient doesn't understand
- Damages rapport, reduces engagement with treatment

**Correct Approach**:
- **Plain language**: "You've lost interest in things you used to enjoy, you're sleeping poorly, and everything feels slowed down"
- Check understanding: "Does that make sense?"

---

### Mistake 6: Not Assessing Functional Impairment

**Problem**: Documenting symptoms without asking how they affect patient's life

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Functional impairment is KEY to diagnosis (DSM-5 requires symptoms cause "significant distress or impairment")
- Severity assessment guides treatment (mild depression → psychological therapy first; severe depression → medication + therapy)
- Monitoring: Functional improvement = treatment working

**Correct Approach**:
- **ALWAYS ask**: "How have these symptoms affected your work/study/relationships/self-care?"
- Document: "Patient reports symptoms significantly impair function - unable to work for past 4 weeks, withdrawn from friends, struggling with self-care."

---

### Mistake 7: Being Judgmental About Substance Use

**Problem**: "Why are you using drugs?" (judgmental tone)

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Patient feels judged, shamed → Stops disclosing → Inaccurate history
- Substance use is often coping mechanism for mental illness (self-medication)

**Correct Approach**:
- **Non-judgmental, normalize**: "Many people use substances to cope with stress. I need to ask so I can give you the best care."
- "Do you use any recreational drugs or alcohol? If so, what and how much?"
- **Harm minimization approach**, not abstinence-only (meet patient where they are)

  - [James: "I don't know, maybe the weed? But everyone can really hear my thoughts."] → Partial insight
- "Is there family or friends I can speak with?" [Can call my dad]

**Formulation**:
"James is a 22-year-old male presenting with first episode psychosis (auditory hallucinations, paranoid delusions, thought broadcasting, 2-month duration) with significant functional decline. Differential: 1) Drug-induced psychosis (cannabis, amphetamine use), 2) Schizophrenia (family history, gradual onset, negative symptoms - social withdrawal). Risk: MODERATE (command hallucinations present, though not acting on them; self-neglect). Plan: Admit to psychiatric unit (voluntary or involuntary if refuses), cease substances, antipsychotic medication (olanzapine/risperidone), urine drug screen, investigate organic causes (FBC, U&E, TFTs, CT head), collateral from father, Early Psychosis Intervention Program referral."

## Summary: Key Takeaways for Psychiatric History-Taking

### 1. Differential from First Symptom
- Low mood → Depression, bipolar, adjustment disorder, grief, organic
- Anxiety → GAD, panic, PTSD, substance, cardiac, thyroid
- Psychosis → Schizophrenia, drug-induced, affective, delirium, organic
- Mania → Bipolar, drug-induced, organic

### 2. ALWAYS Rule Out Organic and Substance
- Ask about medical conditions, medications, substance use
- Red flags: New-onset in older adult, acute onset, visual hallucinations, neurological signs
- Investigate if suspected

### 3. Integrated Risk Assessment
- Screen ALL patients with depression/anxiety for suicide
- Use graduated approach (hopelessness → passive → active → plan)
- Assess violence risk if history, paranoia, command hallucinations
- Document thoroughly

### 4. Collateral History is Essential
- Patient may lack insight, minimize, or be unable to provide history
- Contact family, GP, previous treating team (with consent or if safety concern)

### 5. Screen for Bipolar in Depression
- ALWAYS ask about mania/hypomania in depression
- Antidepressants alone in bipolar → Can trigger mania

### 6. Functional Impairment = Severity
- Ask: "How have symptoms affected work/relationships/self-care?"
- Guides treatment intensity

### 7. Non-Judgmental About Substance Use
- Normalize: "Many people use substances to cope"
- Harm minimization approach

### 8. Australian Mental Health Services
- GP Mental Health Plan → 10 subsidized psychology sessions
- Crisis: Lifeline 13 11 14, Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636
- Mental Health Act: Involuntary only if mental illness + risk + no less restrictive option

### 9. Common IMG Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Not ruling out organic causes
- ❌ Not asking about suicidal thoughts
- ❌ Not seeking collateral history
- ❌ Not screening for bipolar in depression
- ❌ Using medical jargon
- ❌ Not assessing functional impairment
- ❌ Being judgmental about substance use

### 10. Documentation
- Document risk assessment thoroughly
- Use patient's own words for presenting complaint
- Clear formulation: Diagnosis, differential, risk level, plan
