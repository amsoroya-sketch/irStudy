## Dr. Amir Soufi's Core Principle Applied to Obstetric History

### The Differential-Driven Mindset for Pregnancy Presentations

**Traditional Approach (WRONG for OSCE)**:
1. Pregnant patient presents with complaint
2. Take full obstetric history mechanically
3. Think about diagnosis at the end

**Dr. Amir's Approach (CORRECT for OSCE)**:
1. **Immediately think based on gestational age + symptom**:
   - "20 weeks pregnant with bleeding" → Think: Miscarriage (if <20w), Placenta praevia, Placental abruption, Cervical causes
   - "32 weeks with abdominal pain" → Think: Labour (preterm), Placental abruption, Uterine rupture (if previous C-section), Non-obstetric (appendicitis, cholecystitis)
   - "36 weeks with reduced movements" → Think: Placental insufficiency, Fetal distress, Cord accident
2. **Gestational age determines differential** - this is CRITICAL
3. **Your questions are DRIVEN by differential and urgency**
4. **Risk stratification from the first question**

**Example**:
- Patient: "I'm 12 weeks pregnant and bleeding"
- **Think immediately**: "Miscarriage (most common <12w), Ectopic (though should have presented earlier), Molar pregnancy, Cervical causes"
- **Your next questions**: "How much bleeding? Any pain? Any tissue passed? Previous ultrasound confirming intrauterine pregnancy?"
- **Urgency assessment**: "Any dizziness, shoulder tip pain?" (ruptured ectopic)

**This gestational age-based differential thinking is essential for obstetric OSCE success.**

## Part 1: Essential Obstetric Calculations and Terminology

### Calculating Gestational Age and EDD

**Last Menstrual Period (LMP)**:
- **First day** of last normal menstrual period
- Used to calculate gestational age and EDD

**Naegele's Rule** (calculating EDD):
- **EDD = LMP + 1 year - 3 months + 7 days**
- Example: LMP = 1st March 2024 → EDD = 8th December 2024

**Alternative**: Use pregnancy wheel or ultrasound dating

**Gestational Age**:
- Expressed in **weeks + days** (e.g., 28+4 means 28 weeks and 4 days)
- **Dating ultrasound** (most accurate):
  - **First trimester** (before 14 weeks): Crown-rump length (CRL) - accurate to ±5 days
  - **Second trimester** (14-20 weeks): Biparietal diameter, femur length - accurate to ±7-10 days
  - If discrepancy >7 days between LMP and ultrasound → Use **ultrasound dating**

**Trimesters**:
- **First trimester**: 0-13+6 weeks
- **Second trimester**: 14-27+6 weeks
- **Third trimester**: 28 weeks to delivery

**Viability**: ~24 weeks (survival possible with intensive care, but outcomes improve significantly after 28 weeks)

**Term pregnancy**:
- **Early term**: 37-38+6 weeks
- **Full term**: 39-40+6 weeks
- **Late term**: 41-41+6 weeks
- **Post-term**: ≥42 weeks

---

### Obstetric Terminology (GTPAL System)

**Gravida (G)**: Total number of pregnancies (including current)
**Para (P)**: Described using TPAL:
- **T**: Term deliveries (≥37 weeks)
- **P**: Preterm deliveries (20-36+6 weeks)
- **A**: Abortions/miscarriages (<20 weeks) including ectopic and molar
- **L**: Living children

**Examples**:
- **G1 P0**: First pregnancy, no previous deliveries (primigravida)
- **G3 P1+0+1+1**: 3rd pregnancy, 1 term delivery, 0 preterm, 1 miscarriage, 1 living child
- **G4 P2+1+0+3**: 4th pregnancy, 2 term, 1 preterm, 0 miscarriages, 3 living children

**Alternative Australian notation**: G3 P2 (gravida 3, para 2 - simpler, just counts deliveries)

**Other Terms**:
- **Primigravida**: First pregnancy
- **Multigravida**: ≥2 pregnancies
- **Nullipara**: Never delivered beyond 20 weeks
- **Primipara**: Delivered once beyond 20 weeks
- **Multipara**: Delivered ≥2 times beyond 20 weeks
- **Grand multipara**: ≥5 deliveries (higher risk complications)

---

## Part 2: Antenatal Booking History (First Visit)

### Framework: "PREGNANT" + Differential Risk Stratification

This is typically a **longer OSCE station** (often 10-12 minutes for booking history).

---

#### P - **PRESENTING PREGNANCY** (Current Pregnancy Details)

**Opening**:
"Congratulations on your pregnancy. I'd like to take a detailed history today to ensure we provide you with the best care throughout your pregnancy. Is that alright?"

**Key Questions**:

1. **"When was the first day of your last menstrual period?"**
   - Calculate gestational age and EDD (use Naegele's rule or wheel)
   - "Based on that, you're currently [X] weeks pregnant, with an expected delivery date of [date]. Does that sound right?"

2. **"Were you trying to conceive, or was this pregnancy a surprise?"**
   - Planned pregnancy (may have been taking folate already)
   - Unplanned (need to assess feelings, support)

3. **"Have you had an ultrasound scan yet?"**
   - Dating ultrasound (confirming dates, intrauterine pregnancy, viability)
   - If not yet done: "We'll arrange a dating scan at 7-10 weeks to confirm dates and check baby is developing normally"

4. **"Have you had any bleeding or pain?"**
   - **Red flag screening** from the start
   - Any bleeding <24 weeks = threatened miscarriage until proven otherwise

5. **"How have you been feeling? Any nausea, vomiting, tiredness?"**
   - Normal early pregnancy symptoms (nausea/vomiting in 70-80%, usually resolves by 16-20 weeks)
   - **Hyperemesis gravidarum**: Severe vomiting, unable to keep fluids down, weight loss, ketones

6. **"Are you taking any pregnancy vitamins?"**
   - **Folate/folic acid**: 400-500 mcg daily (ideally pre-conception and first 12 weeks, reduces neural tube defects)
   - **Iodine**: 150 mcg daily (Australian recommendation - reduces cretinism)
   - If not taking: Prescribe pregnancy multivitamin (e.g., Elevit) - PBS approved

---

#### R - **REPRODUCTIVE HISTORY** (Obstetric History)

**Gravida and Para**: "Is this your first pregnancy, or have you been pregnant before?"

**For Each Previous Pregnancy** (if multigravida):

**Systematic Questions**:
1. **Year of delivery**: "When was this?"
2. **Gestation at delivery**: "How many weeks pregnant were you?"
3. **Mode of delivery**: "Was it a normal vaginal delivery, assisted (forceps/vacuum), or caesarean section?"
   - **If caesarean**: "What was the reason for the caesarean?"
   - **Classical vs lower segment**: "Do you know what type of incision was made?" (Classical = vertical = high rupture risk, Lower segment = horizontal = standard)
4. **Labour details**: "How long was your labour? Any complications?"
5. **Baby's weight**: "How much did the baby weigh?"
   - **Macrosomia** (>4kg) = risk factor for gestational diabetes, shoulder dystocia
   - **Low birth weight** (<2.5kg) = may indicate placental insufficiency, IUGR
6. **Baby's sex and name** (personalizes, shows you care)
7. **Baby's health**: "Was the baby healthy at birth? Any admission to special care?"
8. **Current health**: "How is [name] doing now?"

**Complications to Specifically Ask About**:
- **Gestational diabetes**: "Did you develop diabetes during pregnancy?" → Risk recurrence 30-50%
- **Pre-eclampsia**: "Did you have high blood pressure or protein in urine?" → Risk recurrence 15-20%
- **Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH)**: "Did you have heavy bleeding after delivery?" → Risk recurrence
- **Preterm labour**: "Did you go into labour early?" → Risk recurrence
- **Instrumental delivery**: "Did they use forceps or vacuum?"
- **Perineal trauma**: "Did you have tearing? Were stitches needed?"

**Miscarriages/Terminations**:
- "Have you had any miscarriages or terminations?"
- **How many, at what gestation, any investigations or treatment?**
- **Recurrent miscarriage** (≥3 consecutive) = needs thrombophilia, autoimmune, chromosomal workup

**Ectopic Pregnancy**:
- "Have you ever had a pregnancy in the fallopian tube (ectopic pregnancy)?"
- Risk recurrence 10-15%

---

#### E - **EXISTING MEDICAL CONDITIONS** (Medical History)

**CRITICAL for Risk Stratification**

**Systematic Review**:

**Cardiovascular**:
- **"Any heart problems, high blood pressure, blood clots?"**
- **Hypertension**: Pre-existing HTN = high risk (pre-eclampsia risk, need aspirin from 12 weeks)
- **Cardiac disease**: Refer cardiology + obstetric medicine (some conditions contraindicate pregnancy)
- **Previous DVT/PE**: Need thromboprophylaxis (LMWH) during pregnancy

**Diabetes**:
- **"Do you have diabetes?"**
- **Pre-existing diabetes** (Type 1 or 2): High risk pregnancy
  - Needs tight glucose control (target HbA1c <6.5% pre-conception, <6% during pregnancy)
  - Higher risk: Congenital anomalies (cardiac, neural tube), miscarriage, stillbirth, macrosomia, pre-eclampsia
  - **Medications**: Stop oral hypoglycaemics (except metformin) → Switch to insulin
- **Gestational diabetes** (previous pregnancy): 50-70% risk recurrence → Early OGTT at booking, repeat 24-28 weeks

**Renal**:
- **"Any kidney problems?"**
- **Chronic kidney disease**: Higher risk pre-eclampsia, IUGR, preterm delivery

**Autoimmune**:
- **"Any autoimmune conditions like lupus, thyroid problems?"**
- **SLE**: Higher risk flare, pre-eclampsia, miscarriage, IUGR, stillbirth (needs close monitoring)
- **Antiphospholipid syndrome**: Recurrent miscarriage, thrombosis → Needs aspirin + LMWH

**Thyroid**:
- **Hypothyroidism**: Need adequate thyroxine replacement (TSH <2.5 in pregnancy)
- **Hyperthyroidism**: Needs specialist management (risk of thyroid storm, neonatal thyrotoxicosis)

**Epilepsy**:
- **"Do you have epilepsy?"**
- **Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs)**: Teratogenic (especially valproate - 10% major malformations, neural tube defects)
- **Folate**: Higher dose (5mg daily) if on AEDs
- **Neurology referral**: Optimize medication (prefer lamotrigine or levetiracetam monotherapy if possible)

**Mental Health**:
- **"Any history of depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions?"**
- **Previous postnatal depression**: 50% recurrence risk
- **Psychiatric medications**: Some unsafe in pregnancy (need review)
- **Safeguarding**: Assess current mental state, support systems

**Infections**:
- **"Any chronic infections like hepatitis, HIV?"**
- **HIV**: Can achieve <1% transmission with antiretrovirals + elective caesarean if viral load not suppressed
- **Hepatitis B**: Baby needs immunoglobulin + vaccine at birth if mother HBsAg positive
- **Hepatitis C**: Avoid invasive procedures (amniocentesis, FSE), no specific interventions, ~5% vertical transmission

---

#### G - **GYNAECOLOGICAL HISTORY**

**Menstrual History**:
- **"Before you got pregnant, were your periods regular?"**
- Irregular periods → May affect dating (unreliable LMP)

**Cervical Screening**:
- **"When was your last Pap smear? Was it normal?"**
- Cervical screening in pregnancy: Can perform if due, but defer if not urgent (pregnancy changes cervix)

**Previous Gynaecological Surgery**:
- **"Any operations on your womb, ovaries, or cervix?"**
- **LLETZ/cone biopsy** (cervical treatment): Risk of cervical incompetence → May need cervical length monitoring
- **Myomectomy** (fibroid removal): Risk of uterine rupture in labour (may need elective caesarean)
- **Ovarian cystectomy**: Document (may see scar on ultrasound)

**Subfertility/Assisted Conception**:
- **"Did you need help to conceive this pregnancy? IVF, fertility treatment?"**
- **IVF/ICSI**: Higher risk multiple pregnancy (though mostly single embryo transfer now), ectopic (even with IVF), obstetric complications
- **Document treatment**: May affect dating (know exact conception date if IVF)

---

#### N - **NUTRITIONAL and LIFESTYLE FACTORS**

**Diet and Supplements**:
- **"Tell me about your diet. Are you vegetarian or have any dietary restrictions?"**
- **Folate/iodine supplementation**: Check compliance
- **Iron**: "Do you eat red meat?" (vegetarians at higher risk anaemia)

**Foods to Avoid** (Listeriosis and Toxoplasmosis risk):
- **"Are you aware of foods to avoid in pregnancy?"**
- Educate if not:
  - **Listeria risk**: Soft cheeses (brie, camembert), deli meats, pâté, pre-prepared salads, smoked salmon
  - **Toxoplasma risk**: Undercooked meat, unwashed vegetables, cat litter (wear gloves)
  - **High mercury**: Limit tuna (1 small can or 1 fresh steak weekly), avoid shark/marlin/swordfish
  - **Vitamin A**: Avoid liver, liver pâté (teratogenic in high doses)
- **Alcohol**: "Do you drink alcohol?" → Advise **complete avoidance** (no safe level, risk fetal alcohol syndrome)

**Smoking**:
- **"Do you smoke cigarettes?"**
- **If yes**: "How many per day?"
- **Risks**: IUGR, placental abruption, preterm delivery, SIDS, stillbirth
- **Cessation**: "I'd strongly advise stopping. Can I refer you to Quitline for support?" (Quitline 13 7848 - free in Australia)
- **NRT**: Safe in pregnancy if helps cessation (preferable to smoking)

**Recreational Drugs**:
- **"Do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana, amphetamines, cocaine?"**
- **Risks**: Neonatal withdrawal, IUGR, abruption (cocaine), congenital anomalies
- **Support**: Offer drug and alcohol service referral, non-judgmental approach

**Domestic Violence Screening** (MANDATORY in antenatal booking):
- **"I ask all pregnant women this: Do you feel safe at home?"**
- **Or**: "Has anyone at home ever hurt you or made you feel afraid?"
- **If yes**: Private conversation (ask partner to leave), safety plan, social work referral, document carefully
- **Resources**: 1800RESPECT (1800 737 732), local domestic violence services

---

#### A - **ALLERGIES**

**"Do you have any allergies to medications, latex, or anything else?"**
- Document clearly
- **Penicillin allergy**: Very common, often not true allergy (ask details: rash vs anaphylaxis)
- **Latex allergy**: Important for delivery (use non-latex gloves)

---

#### N - **NATAL PLANNING** (Plans for Pregnancy and Birth)

**Antenatal Care Plans**:
- **"Where would you like to have your antenatal care and delivery?"**
- **Public vs private**: Explain options
  - **Public** (free under Medicare): Shared care (GP + hospital) or hospital-only midwifery care
  - **Private**: Obstetrician-led care, choice of hospital, private room (out-of-pocket costs)

**Birth Preferences**:
- **"Have you thought about how you'd like to give birth?"**
- Explore preferences: Natural/vaginal vs planned caesarean, epidural vs natural pain relief, water birth, etc.
- **If previous caesarean**: "For this pregnancy, would you like to try for a vaginal birth (VBAC) or have another caesarean?"
  - **VBAC success rate**: 60-80% if previous CS for non-recurrent reason (e.g., breech)
  - **Risks**: Uterine rupture 0.5-1% (if labour), but lower risk overall than repeat CS

**Antenatal Classes**:
- **"Have you heard about antenatal classes?"**
- Recommend (free at public hospitals, or private options like Calmbirth)

**Infant Feeding**:
- **"Have you thought about how you'd like to feed your baby?"**
- **Breastfeeding**: Recommended (WHO: exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months)
- **Formula**: Non-judgmental support if chosen

---

#### T - **TESTS and SCREENING** (Antenatal Investigations)

**First Trimester Screening**:

**Dating Ultrasound** (7-10 weeks):
- Confirm intrauterine pregnancy, viability, gestational age
- **Medicare rebate**: Item 16500 (one per pregnancy)

**Combined First Trimester Screening** (11-13+6 weeks):
- **Purpose**: Screen for trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), 18, 13
- **Components**:
  1. **Maternal age** (risk increases with age)
  2. **Nuchal translucency** (NT) on ultrasound (fluid at back of baby's neck - thick NT = higher risk)
  3. **Maternal serum**: βhCG and PAPP-A (pregnancy-associated plasma protein A)
- **Result**: Risk score (e.g., 1 in 500)
  - **High risk**: >1 in 300 → Offer NIPT or diagnostic testing
  - **Low risk**: <1 in 300 → Reassuring, but not diagnostic

**Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT)** - Cell-free fetal DNA:
- **When**: From 10 weeks
- **Detects**: Trisomy 21, 18, 13, sex chromosome abnormalities
- **Accuracy**: 99% sensitivity for T21
- **Limitation**: Screening test, NOT diagnostic (false positives possible)
- **Cost**: ~$400-600 (not Medicare-funded unless high risk)

**Diagnostic Testing** (if high-risk screen):
- **Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)**: 11-14 weeks, miscarriage risk ~0.5-1%
- **Amniocentesis**: From 15 weeks, miscarriage risk ~0.5%
- **Result**: Karyotype (definitive diagnosis)

**Maternal Bloods** (booking visit):
- **FBC**: Anaemia (common in pregnancy - dilutional, increased demand)
- **Blood group and antibodies**: Rh status, antibody screen
  - **If Rh negative**: Need Anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 and 34 weeks (prevent alloimmunization)
- **Infectious diseases**:
  - **Rubella serology**: If non-immune → Vaccinate postpartum (live vaccine, can't give in pregnancy)
  - **Syphilis** (TPPA): Screen all (treat with penicillin if positive - prevents congenital syphilis)
  - **Hepatitis B** (HBsAg): If positive → Baby needs immunoglobulin + vaccine at birth
  - **HIV**: Offer to all (treatment reduces transmission to <1%)
  - **Hepatitis C**: Now routinely offered in many states
- **Urinalysis + culture**: Detect asymptomatic bacteriuria (treat to prevent pyelonephritis)
- **TSH**: If high-risk (history thyroid disease, Type 1 diabetes, family history)

**Second Trimester**:

**Morphology Ultrasound** (18-20 weeks):
- **Purpose**: Detailed anatomy scan, detect structural abnormalities
- **Checks**: Brain, heart (4 chambers), spine, kidneys, limbs, face, umbilical cord, placental location
- **Sex**: Can be determined if parents wish to know
- **Placenta praevia**: If low-lying at 20 weeks → Repeat scan at 32 weeks (often migrates up)

**Gestational Diabetes Screening** (24-28 weeks):
- **OGTT** (Oral Glucose Tolerance Test): 75g glucose load
- **Diagnostic criteria** (ADIPS):
  - Fasting ≥5.1 mmol/L, OR
  - 1 hour ≥10.0 mmol/L, OR
  - 2 hour ≥8.5 mmol/L
- **If positive**: Referral to diabetes educator, endocrinologist, dietary modification, possible insulin

**Third Trimester**:

**FBC** (28 weeks):
- Recheck haemoglobin (anaemia common)
- If Hb <100 g/L → Iron supplementation (oral ferrous sulfate or IV iron if severe/not tolerating oral)

**Anti-D** (if Rh negative):
- 28 weeks and 34 weeks (or single dose at 28 weeks with some preparations)

**Group B Streptococcus (GBS) Screening** (35-37 weeks):
- **Vaginal/rectal swab**
- **If positive**: Intrapartum IV antibiotics (penicillin) during labour (prevent neonatal sepsis)

## Part 3: Symptom-Based Obstetric History (Acute Presentations)

### Framework: Gestational Age + Symptom = Differential

---

### VAGINAL BLEEDING in Pregnancy

**Differential by Gestational Age**:

#### First Trimester Bleeding (<14 weeks)

| **Diagnosis** | **Key Features** | **Examination** | **Investigations** | **Management** |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Threatened miscarriage** | Bleeding, closed cervix, viable pregnancy | Cervix closed, uterus appropriate size | Ultrasound (fetal heartbeat present) | Reassurance, avoid intercourse, repeat USS 1-2 weeks |
| **Inevitable miscarriage** | Bleeding + pain, open cervix, products visible | Cervix open, products of conception visible | Ultrasound (if uncertain) | Surgical (D&C), medical (misoprostol), or expectant management |
| **Incomplete miscarriage** | Bleeding + pain, some tissue passed, open cervix | Cervix open, retained products | Ultrasound (retained products) | Surgical (D&C) or medical (misoprostol) |
| **Complete miscarriage** | Bleeding stopped, all tissue passed, closed cervix | Cervix closed, uterus small | Ultrasound (empty uterus) | Reassurance, follow-up βhCG if needed |
| **Missed miscarriage** | Minimal/no bleeding, no symptoms, non-viable pregnancy found on scan | Cervix closed, uterus smaller than expected | Ultrasound (fetal pole with no heartbeat, or empty sac >25mm) | Expectant, medical, or surgical |
| **Ectopic pregnancy** | Bleeding + pain, often unilateral, may have shoulder tip pain (haemoperitoneum) | Cervix closed, adnexal tenderness, cervical excitation | βhCG + ultrasound (no intrauterine pregnancy, possible adnexal mass, free fluid) | Medical (methotrexate) if stable and early, surgical (laparoscopy) if ruptured or unstable |
| **Molar pregnancy** | Bleeding, exaggerated pregnancy symptoms (hyperemesis), uterus large for dates | Uterus larger than expected, no fetal heart | Ultrasound ("snowstorm" appearance), very high βhCG | Suction curettage, follow-up βhCG (monitor for choriocarcinoma) |
| **Cervical causes** | Bleeding post-coital, no pain | Cervix friable/polyp/ectropion | Speculum exam (visualize source) | Usually benign, reassure, treat if recurrent |

---

#### Second/Third Trimester Bleeding (>14 weeks)

| **Diagnosis** | **Gestation** | **Key Features** | **Management** |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Placenta praevia** | Usually >20 weeks | **Painless vaginal bleeding**, often recurrent, placenta covering cervical os | **DO NOT perform vaginal examination** (may provoke massive haemorrhage). Ultrasound confirms. Admit if bleeding, corticosteroids if preterm, elective CS at 37-38 weeks |
| **Placental abruption** | >20 weeks | **Painful bleeding** (constant pain), uterine tenderness, woody hard uterus, fetal distress | Resuscitation (IV access, blood products), CTG monitoring, emergency delivery (CS if fetal distress, vaginal if stable and progressing) |
| **Vasa praevia** | At rupture of membranes | **Painless vaginal bleeding** at ROM, fetal distress (fetal blood loss) | **EMERGENCY** - immediate CS (fetal mortality high if not diagnosed antenatally) |
| **Cervical causes** | Any | Post-coital, cervical polyp/ectropion, speculum shows source | Usually benign, reassure |
| **"Show"** (labour) | >37 weeks | Mucus plug with blood-staining, associated with contractions | Normal part of labour onset |

---

### History-Taking for Vaginal Bleeding

**Opening**: "I understand you've been experiencing some bleeding. I'd like to ask you some questions to work out what might be causing this. Is that alright?"

**Key Questions** (Differential-Driven):

**Quantify Bleeding**:
1. **"How much bleeding have you had?"**
   - **Spotting**: Small amount, on wiping only
   - **Light**: Less than a period
   - **Moderate**: Like a period
   - **Heavy**: Soaking pads, passing clots
   - **Massive**: Soaking through clothes, lightheaded (haemodynamic compromise)

2. **"How many pads have you soaked?"**
   - Quantify objectively

3. **"Have you passed any clots or tissue?"**
   - **Clots**: Size (small vs golf ball-sized)
   - **Tissue**: Products of conception (miscarriage)

**Associated Symptoms**:

4. **"Do you have any pain?"**
   - **Painful bleeding** → Think: Miscarriage (cramping), ectopic (sharp, unilateral), abruption (constant, severe)
   - **Painless bleeding** → Think: Placenta praevia, cervical causes

5. **"If you have pain, where is it?"**
   - **Cramping, central** → Miscarriage, labour
   - **Unilateral, sharp** → Ectopic
   - **Constant, severe, across abdomen** → Abruption

6. **"Any shoulder tip pain?"**
   - **Red flag for ruptured ectopic** (blood irritating diaphragm)

7. **"Any dizziness, feeling faint?"**
   - **Hypovolaemia** → Significant blood loss

**Obstetric Context**:

8. **"How many weeks pregnant are you?"**
   - **<12 weeks**: Likely miscarriage or ectopic
   - **>20 weeks**: Placenta praevia or abruption

9. **"Have you had an ultrasound confirming the pregnancy is in your womb?"**
   - If no ultrasound yet → Cannot exclude ectopic

10. **"Do you know where your placenta is located?"**
    - If low-lying placenta on previous scan → Placenta praevia more likely

**Precipitating Factors**:

11. **"Did anything trigger the bleeding? Intercourse, exercise, trauma?"**
    - **Post-coital**: Cervical causes (ectropion, polyp)
    - **Trauma**: Abruption

**Red Flags to Screen**:

12. **"Any fever, smelly discharge?"**
    - **Septic miscarriage** (infected retained products) - needs urgent antibiotics + evacuation

13. **"Any gush of fluid?"**
    - **Ruptured membranes** + bleeding → High risk (vasa praevia, cord prolapse, abruption)

### ABDOMINAL PAIN in Pregnancy

**Differential by Gestational Age and Pain Characteristics**:

#### First Trimester Pain

| **Diagnosis** | **Pain Characteristics** | **Associated Features** | **Key Points** |
|--------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Ectopic pregnancy** | Unilateral, sharp, may be shoulder tip pain | Bleeding, amenorrhoea, risk factors (PID, previous ectopic, IUD) | **EMERGENCY** if ruptured |
| **Miscarriage** | Cramping, central suprapubic | Bleeding, tissue passage | Confirm with ultrasound |
| **Corpus luteum cyst** | Unilateral, may be sharp if ruptured/torsion | No bleeding usually | Benign, resolves by 12-14 weeks |
| **Ovarian torsion** | Sudden, severe, unilateral | Nausea, vomiting, adnexal mass | **Surgical emergency** |
| **UTI/pyelonephritis** | Suprapubic (cystitis) or loin pain (pyelonephritis) | Dysuria, frequency, fever | Treat with pregnancy-safe antibiotics |

---

#### Second/Third Trimester Pain

| **Diagnosis** | **Gestation** | **Pain Characteristics** | **Associated Features** |
|--------------|-------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Placental abruption** | >20 weeks | Sudden, severe, constant | Bleeding (may be concealed), woody hard uterus, fetal distress |
| **Labour (term or preterm)** | >20 weeks | Regular, rhythmic contractions (every 3-5 min) | Cervical dilation, show, ruptured membranes |
| **Uterine rupture** | Labour, previous CS | Sudden, severe, "tearing" sensation | Abnormal CTG, palpable fetal parts, haemodynamic instability |
| **Round ligament pain** | 2nd trimester | Sharp, bilateral lower quadrants, on movement | Benign, no other symptoms |
| **Braxton Hicks contractions** | >20 weeks (common 3rd trimester) | Irregular, painless or mildly uncomfortable tightenings | No cervical change, resolve with rest |
| **Pre-eclampsia** | >20 weeks | Epigastric/RUQ pain (liver capsule stretch) | Hypertension, proteinuria, headache, visual disturbance |
| **HELLP syndrome** | >20 weeks | RUQ pain | Hypertension, Haemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets |
| **Appendicitis** | Any | RLQ pain (but appendix displaced upward by gravid uterus → may be higher) | Fever, nausea, vomiting, rebound tenderness |
| **Cholecystitis** | Any | RUQ pain | Fever, nausea, vomiting, more common in pregnancy |

---

### History-Taking for Abdominal Pain

**Key Questions**:

**Pain Characteristics** (SOCRATES - adapted):

1. **Site**: "Where is the pain?"
2. **Onset**: "When did it start? Sudden or gradual?"
3. **Character**: "What does it feel like? Cramping, sharp, dull, constant?"
4. **Radiation**: "Does it go anywhere else? Shoulder, back?"
5. **Associated symptoms**:
   - **Bleeding?** (abruption, miscarriage, ectopic)
   - **Contractions?** (labour)
   - **Fever?** (infection)
   - **Headache, visual disturbance?** (pre-eclampsia)
   - **Nausea, vomiting?** (many causes)
6. **Timing**: "Is it constant or does it come and go?"
   - **Constant** → Abruption, ectopic, appendicitis
   - **Intermittent, regular** → Labour
   - **Intermittent, irregular** → Braxton Hicks
7. **Exacerbating/Relieving**: "What makes it better or worse?"
8. **Severity**: "On a scale of 0-10, how bad is the pain?"

**Obstetric Context**:
- Gestational age
- Previous ultrasounds (placental location)
- Fetal movements (reduced = fetal distress)

---

### REDUCED FETAL MOVEMENTS

**"Baby not moving as much"**

**When Movements Expected**:
- **Primigravida**: Usually feels movements from 18-20 weeks
- **Multigravida**: May feel from 16-18 weeks (recognizes sensation earlier)
- **Pattern**: Movements increase until ~32 weeks, then plateau (NOT decrease - common myth)

**Normal Movements**:
- No set number, but most women feel ≥10 movements per day
- **Pattern more important than number**: Each baby has own pattern (active vs quiet)

**Differential Diagnosis for Reduced Movements**:

| **Diagnosis** | **Key Features** | **Urgency** |
|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Normal variation** | Mother busy, not noticing, baby sleeping | Reassurance, but **must assess** |
| **Placental insufficiency** | Chronic reduction, IUGR on growth scans | Monitor with CTG, Dopplers, may need early delivery |
| **Fetal distress** | Acute reduction, abnormal CTG | **URGENT** - may need immediate delivery |
| **Cord accident** (cord around neck, cord prolapse) | Sudden reduction/cessation | **EMERGENCY** |
| **Fetal death** | No movements, no heartbeat | Devastating, supportive care, induction of labour |
| **Oligohydramnios** (low fluid) | Reduced movements, small for dates | Monitor, may indicate placental insufficiency |
| **Maternal factors** | Anterior placenta (cushions movements), obesity, busy day | Less concerning, but still assess |

### History-Taking for Reduced Fetal Movements

**Key Questions**:

1. **"When did you last feel baby move?"**
   - **If >24 hours**: **URGENT assessment** needed

2. **"Is this the first time you've noticed reduced movements, or has it happened before?"**
   - **Recurrent reduced movements**: Higher risk of adverse outcome

3. **"What have you tried to get baby to move?"**
   - **Lying on left side, drinking cold drink, eating sugary food**: Often stimulates movements
   - If tried and still not moving → More concerning

4. **"Have you noticed any bleeding, pain, or fluid leaking?"**
   - **Bleeding + reduced movements**: Abruption
   - **Fluid + reduced movements**: Ruptured membranes

5. **"Any recent trauma or fall?"**
   - Abruption risk

**Management** (explain to patient in OSCE):
"Reduced fetal movements can be a sign that baby is not getting enough oxygen, so we take this seriously. I'd like to:
1. **Listen to baby's heartbeat** with a Doppler or CTG (cardiotocograph)
2. **Perform CTG monitoring** for 20-40 minutes to assess baby's heart rate pattern
3. **Ultrasound** to check amniotic fluid, baby's size, and placental blood flow if needed
4. If everything looks reassuring, we'll advise you to monitor movements closely and come back immediately if you notice reduced movements again."

**CRITICAL**: **Never dismiss reduced fetal movements**. Up to 50% of stillbirths are preceded by maternal perception of reduced movements.

### HEADACHE in Pregnancy

**Differential Diagnosis**:

| **Diagnosis** | **Features** | **Management** |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Pre-eclampsia** | **Severe, frontal headache**, visual disturbance (flashing lights, blurred vision), RUQ pain, hypertension, proteinuria | **Check BP, urine dipstick**. If pre-eclampsia → Admit, antihypertensives, magnesium sulfate (if severe), delivery (only cure) |
| **Migraine** | Throbbing, unilateral, photophobia, nausea, aura, history of migraines | Paracetamol safe, avoid NSAIDs, triptans (some safe in pregnancy - sumatriptan), rest, dark room |
| **Tension headache** | Bilateral, "band-like", stress-related | Paracetamol, reassurance, relaxation |
| **Intracranial haemorrhage** | Sudden, "thunderclap" headache, worst ever, neurological signs | **EMERGENCY** - CT head, neurosurgery |
| **Cerebral venous thrombosis** | Headache, seizure, neurological deficit, pregnancy/postpartum | **URGENT** - CT/MRI, anticoagulation |

**Key Questions**:
1. **"Is this the worst headache of your life?"** (Subarachnoid haemorrhage)
2. **"Do you have any visual changes, like flashing lights or blurred vision?"** (Pre-eclampsia)
3. **"Any pain in your upper tummy?"** (Pre-eclampsia - RUQ pain)
4. **"Do you have a history of migraines?"** (Migraine more likely)
5. **"Have you checked your blood pressure recently?"** (Pre-eclampsia)

**Red Flags** (require urgent assessment):
- **Severe headache + hypertension** (BP >140/90) → Pre-eclampsia
- **Sudden, thunderclap headache** → Intracranial bleed
- **Headache + neurological signs** (weakness, visual loss, seizure) → Stroke, CVT
- **Headache + fever + neck stiffness** → Meningitis

## Part 4: High-Risk Pregnancy Factors

### Recognizing High-Risk Pregnancies (For Shared Care vs Obstetric-Led Care)

**High-risk factors requiring **specialist obstetric care** (not suitable for midwifery-only or GP shared care alone)**:

**Medical**:
- **Cardiac disease** (especially structural heart disease, pulmonary hypertension)
- **Chronic kidney disease** (especially if eGFR <60)
- **Diabetes** (pre-existing Type 1 or 2)
- **Epilepsy** (on anti-epileptics)
- **Autoimmune disease** (SLE, antiphospholipid syndrome)
- **HIV**, active hepatitis C
- **Previous VTE** (need thromboprophylaxis planning)

**Obstetric**:
- **Previous stillbirth or neonatal death**
- **Previous preterm birth** (<34 weeks)
- **Previous severe pre-eclampsia** (especially if delivered <34 weeks)
- **Recurrent miscarriage** (≥3)
- **Previous classical caesarean** or myomectomy (uterine rupture risk)
- **Multiple pregnancy** (twins, triplets)
- **Placenta praevia**
- **Fetal anomaly** detected on scan
- **Polyhydramnios or oligohydramnios**

**Social**:
- **Domestic violence**
- **Significant mental health issues** (active psychosis, severe depression, previous puerperal psychosis)
- **Substance use** (ongoing drug/alcohol use)
- **Safeguarding concerns** (child protection involvement)
- **Homelessness, lack of support**

---

## Part 5: Australian Antenatal Care Schedule

### Medicare Antenatal Care Plan (Shared Care)

**GP Visits** (typical schedule for low-risk pregnancy):

- **Booking visit**: 6-10 weeks (confirm pregnancy, bloods, dating scan referral, antenatal care plan)
- **Monthly visits**: 10-28 weeks
- **Fortnightly**: 28-36 weeks
- **Weekly**: 36 weeks to delivery

**Hospital Midwife/Obstetrician Visits**:
- Varies by model of care (shared care: hospital visits at booking, 28-32w, 36w, 38w, 40w)

**Medicare Item Numbers**:
- **Item 16400**: Antenatal care - GP shared care (first visit - includes care plan)
- **Item 16401-16407**: Subsequent antenatal visits
- Up to 10 GP antenatal visits are Medicare-rebated

---

### Key Routine Assessments at Each Visit

**Every Visit**:
1. **Blood pressure**: Detect hypertension/pre-eclampsia (normal <140/90)
2. **Urinalysis**: Protein (pre-eclampsia), glucose (diabetes), leucocytes/nitrites (UTI)
3. **Fundal height** (from 20-24 weeks):
   - Measure symphysis-fundal height (SFH) in cm with tape measure
   - Should correlate with gestational age ± 2cm (e.g., 28 weeks = ~28cm)
   - **If >2cm discrepancy**: Ultrasound to assess (large = macrosomia, polyhydramnios; small = IUGR, oligohydramnios)
4. **Fetal heart rate**: From 12 weeks (Doppler), normal 110-160 bpm
5. **Fetal movements**: Ask about (from 20 weeks)
6. **Weight**: Monitor (excessive gain = GDM risk, inadequate = IUGR risk)
7. **Ask**: Any bleeding, pain, fluid loss, headache, visual disturbance

## Part 6: Common IMG Mistakes in Obstetric History

### Mistake 1: Not Calculating Gestational Age Immediately

**What IMGs Do Wrong**:
- Take full history before establishing dates
- Don't know how to calculate EDD

**Correct Approach**:
- **First question after name/age**: "When was the first day of your last period?"
- **Calculate immediately**: Use Naegele's rule or wheel
- **State gestational age**: "So you're currently 28 weeks and 3 days pregnant"

**Why It Matters**:
- Gestational age determines differential diagnosis and urgency
- Shows competence to examiner

---

### Mistake 2: Not Risk-Stratifying Based on Gestational Age + Symptom

**What IMGs Do Wrong**:
- "Bleeding in pregnancy" → Treat all the same
- Don't think differently about 8 weeks vs 28 weeks

**Correct Approach**:
- **8 weeks + bleeding** → Think miscarriage/ectopic → Check haemodynamic stability, ultrasound
- **28 weeks + bleeding** → Think placenta praevia/abruption → **DO NOT do vaginal exam**, ultrasound, CTG

---

### Mistake 3: Performing Vaginal Examination in Antepartum Haemorrhage

**What IMGs Do Wrong**:
- Patient with bleeding at 30 weeks → Do speculum/digital vaginal exam

**Correct Approach**:
- **NEVER perform vaginal examination in antepartum haemorrhage (>20 weeks) until placenta praevia excluded by ultrasound**
- Digital exam with placenta praevia → Catastrophic haemorrhage

**OSCE Statement**: "I would **not** perform a vaginal examination until I've confirmed the placental location with ultrasound, as this patient may have placenta praevia and digital examination could provoke massive haemorrhage."

---

### Mistake 4: Dismissing Reduced Fetal Movements

**What IMGs Do Wrong**:
- "Baby is probably just sleeping"
- "It's normal for movements to reduce near term" (MYTH)

**Correct Approach**:
- **Always take reduced movements seriously**
- **EVERY patient reporting reduced movements needs assessment** (CTG, ultrasound if indicated)
- **Never assume it's normal without checking**

---

### Mistake 5: Not Screening for Domestic Violence

**What IMGs Do Wrong**:
- Forget to ask about safety at home
- Ask in front of partner

**Correct Approach**:
- **Mandatory in antenatal booking**
- Ask when partner **NOT present** (ask partner to step out)
- "I ask all pregnant women this: Do you feel safe at home?"

---

### Mistake 6: Not Offering Screening Tests

**What IMGs Do Wrong**:
- Don't explain first trimester screening, NIPT, morphology scan

**Correct Approach**:
- **Offer and explain** all screening (first trimester, NIPT, morphology, GDM, GBS)
- Allow patient to make informed choice
- Document consent or decline

## Part 7: OSCE Practice Stations

### OSCE Station 1: Antenatal Booking History

**Candidate Instructions**:
"Mrs. Lee is a 32-year-old woman attending for her first antenatal visit. She is 8 weeks pregnant. Take a comprehensive booking history. You have 10 minutes."

**Key Points to Cover**:
1. **Current pregnancy**: LMP, calculate EDD, confirm intrauterine pregnancy with scan, symptoms, folate/iodine
2. **Obstetric history**: Gravida/para, previous pregnancies (mode of delivery, complications - GDM, pre-eclampsia, PPH)
3. **Medical history**: Diabetes, hypertension, cardiac, renal, thyroid, epilepsy, mental health
4. **Gynae history**: Cervical screening, previous surgery
5. **Medications and allergies**
6. **Lifestyle**: Smoking, alcohol, drugs, diet
7. **Domestic violence screening**: "Do you feel safe at home?"
8. **Plans**: Where deliver, birth preferences
9. **Screening tests**: Explain first trimester screening, offer bloods (FBC, blood group, infections)
10. **Next steps**: Dating scan, follow-up plan

---

### OSCE Station 2: Antepartum Haemorrhage

**Candidate Instructions**:
"Mrs. Patel is 28 weeks pregnant and presents with vaginal bleeding. Take a focused history and explain your initial management plan. You have 8 minutes."

**Approach**:

**History** (4 minutes):
1. **Quantify bleeding**: "How much bleeding? Heavy, light, spotting? Soaking pads?"
2. **Pain**: "Any abdominal pain?" (Painful = abruption, Painless = praevia)
3. **Triggers**: "Any trauma, intercourse?"
4. **Associated symptoms**: "Any contractions, fluid loss, reduced baby movements?"
5. **Obstetric context**: "How many weeks pregnant? Do you know where your placenta is?"
6. **Risk factors**: "Previous bleeding this pregnancy? Smoking? Previous caesarean?"

**Examination and Investigations** (2 minutes):
"I would:
1. **Assess haemodynamic stability**: BP, HR, check for signs of shock (pallor, tachycardia, hypotension)
2. **Abdominal examination**: Fundal height, uterine tenderness (abruption = woody hard uterus), fetal lie, fetal heart rate
3. **Speculum examination ONLY if placenta praevia excluded**
4. **CTG monitoring**: To assess fetal wellbeing
5. **Ultrasound**: Confirm placental location
6. **Bloods**: FBC, group and save (or cross-match if heavy bleeding), coagulation screen if abruption suspected

**Management** (2 minutes):
"Given she's bleeding at 28 weeks, my differential includes placenta praevia and placental abruption. Initial management would be:
1. **Admit to hospital** for observation
2. **IV access** and fluid resuscitation if needed
3. **Anti-D** if she's Rh negative (sensitization risk from fetomaternal haemorrhage)
4. **Corticosteroids** (betamethasone) if risk of preterm delivery (to mature fetal lungs)
5. **Continuous CTG monitoring** if heavy bleeding or signs of abruption
6. **If massive haemorrhage or fetal distress**: Emergency caesarean section
7. **If stable and bleeding settles**: May be able to discharge with clear instructions to return if further bleeding"

---

### OSCE Station 3: Reduced Fetal Movements

**Candidate Instructions**:
"Mrs. Chen is 34 weeks pregnant and concerned that her baby is not moving as much as usual. Take a focused history and explain your assessment plan. You have 8 minutes."

**History** (4 minutes):
1. **"When did you last feel baby move?"**
2. **"Is this the first time, or has it happened before?"**
3. **"What have you tried to stimulate movement?"** (Cold drink, lying on left side, eating)
4. **"Any bleeding, pain, or fluid leakage?"**
5. **"Any recent trauma?"**
6. **"Have you noticed any pattern - is baby usually active at certain times?"**

**Assessment Plan** (4 minutes):
"Reduced fetal movements can indicate that baby is not getting enough oxygen, so we take this seriously. I'd like to:

1. **Immediate assessment**:
   - **Listen to baby's heartbeat** with a handheld Doppler to ensure baby is alive
   - **CTG monitoring** for 20-40 minutes to assess heart rate pattern
     - Looking for: Baseline 110-160bpm, variability >5bpm, accelerations (reassuring), decelerations (concerning)

2. **If CTG reassuring**:
   - **Ultrasound scan** to check:
     - Amniotic fluid volume (oligohydramnios = placental insufficiency)
     - Fetal biometry (growth assessment - is baby growing appropriately?)
     - Umbilical artery Doppler (placental blood flow)

3. **Advice**:
   - Monitor movements closely
   - **Return immediately** if reduced movements again (never dismiss recurrent reduced movements)
   - Increased surveillance (may need repeat CTG/scans)

4. **If CTG abnormal or other concerns**:
   - May need delivery (induction or caesarean depending on urgency)

**Reassurance**: 'Most of the time, everything is fine and baby is just having a quiet day. However, we check carefully because reduced movements can sometimes be a warning sign, and we want to make sure baby is getting enough oxygen and nutrients through the placenta.'"

## Summary: Key Takeaways

### For Antenatal Booking History:
1. **Calculate dates immediately**: LMP → Gestational age and EDD
2. **Systematic PREGNANT framework**: Presenting pregnancy, Reproductive history, Existing medical conditions, Gynaecological history, Nutritional/lifestyle, Allergies, Natal planning, Tests/screening
3. **Risk stratification**: Identify high-risk factors (medical, obstetric, social) → Determine appropriate level of care
4. **Domestic violence screening**: Mandatory, ask when partner not present
5. **Offer all screening tests**: First trimester, NIPT, morphology, GDM, GBS

### For Acute Obstetric Presentations:
1. **Gestational age + symptom = differential**: Always establish dates first
2. **Bleeding**:
   - <14 weeks → Miscarriage or ectopic
   - >20 weeks → Praevia (painless) vs abruption (painful)
   - **NEVER vaginal exam until praevia excluded**
3. **Pain**:
   - Unilateral + early pregnancy → Ectopic
   - Constant + bleeding → Abruption
   - RUQ + late pregnancy → Pre-eclampsia/HELLP
4. **Reduced movements**: ALWAYS assess (CTG + ultrasound if needed), never dismiss

### For Australian Context:
1. **Medicare antenatal schedule**: Up to 10 GP visits rebated, shared care model common
2. **Screening**: First trimester (NT, bloods), morphology (18-20w), GDM (24-28w), GBS (35-37w)
3. **Anti-D**: Rh negative women need at 28 and 34 weeks
4. **High-risk pregnancies**: Specialist obstetric care for medical comorbidities, previous complications, social issues

### For OSCE Success:
1. **Calculate dates out loud**: Shows competence
2. **Verbalize differential thinking**: "Given she's 28 weeks with painless bleeding, I'm thinking placenta praevia"
3. **State what you would NOT do**: "I would NOT perform vaginal examination until placenta praevia excluded"
4. **Always assess reduced movements seriously**: "Reduced movements can indicate fetal compromise, so we need to assess with CTG"
5. **Mention Australian-specific care**: "I'd arrange shared care with GP and hospital," "Medicare rebates antenatal visits"
