## Dr. Amir Soufi's Core Principle Applied to Gynaecological Examination

### The Differential-Driven Examination Approach

**Traditional Approach (WRONG for OSCE)**:
1. Perform examination mechanically
2. Record findings without interpretation
3. Don't relate findings to presenting complaint

**Dr. Amir's Approach (CORRECT for OSCE)**:
1. **Know the presenting complaint BEFORE examination**:
   - "Pelvic pain" → Look specifically for adnexal tenderness (PID, ovarian cyst), uterine tenderness (adenomyosis), cervical excitation (ectopic, PID)
   - "Heavy periods" → Look for enlarged uterus (fibroids), bulky tender uterus (adenomyosis)
   - "Vaginal discharge" → Look carefully at cervix for cervicitis, discharge characteristics
2. **Your examination is TARGETED**:
   - Not robotic, but intelligent
   - Know what you're looking for based on differential
3. **Interpret findings in context**:
   - "Enlarged uterus + heavy periods" → Fibroids or adenomyosis
   - "Cervical excitation + unilateral adnexal tenderness + missed period" → Ectopic pregnancy
   - "Friable cervix + post-coital bleeding" → Cervical ectropion vs cervical cancer

**This focused, differential-driven examination is essential for OSCE success.**

---

## Part 1: General Principles

### Consent and Chaperone

**CRITICAL - Non-negotiable**:

**Consent**:
- **Explain** what you will do and why
- **Obtain verbal consent** (document in notes)
- "I'd like to examine your tummy and perform an internal examination. This involves inserting a speculum - an instrument to look at your cervix - and then an examination with my fingers. Is that alright with you?"
- **Patient can decline** or stop at any time

**Chaperone**:
- **ALWAYS offer chaperone** for intimate examination (regardless of examiner gender)
- "Would you like a female nurse to be present during the examination?"
- **Document** if chaperone present or declined
- **In OSCE**: State clearly "I would offer a chaperone"

**In Australia**:
- **Medical Board guidelines**: Chaperone should be offered for breast, pelvic, rectal examinations
- **Mandatory in some settings** (especially male doctor examining female patient)

---

### Preparation

**Before Examination**:
1. **Empty bladder**: "Can you empty your bladder before we start?"
   - Full bladder makes examination uncomfortable and findings inaccurate
2. **Privacy**: Close curtains, lock door, sign on door
3. **Equipment ready**:
   - Gloves (non-sterile)
   - Lubricant (water-based)
   - Speculums (small, medium, large - choose appropriate size)
   - Swabs (if taking cervical screening or infection swabs)
   - Light source (examination light or torch)
   - Tissues (for patient to clean afterward)

---

## Part 2: Abdominal Examination (Gynaecological)

### Purpose

**Why perform abdominal examination in gynae patients?**
- Detect **pelvic masses** arising from pelvis (large ovarian cyst, fibroid uterus)
- Assess for **tenderness** (peritonism, guarding)
- Exclude **pregnancy** (gravid uterus)
- Detect **ascites** (ovarian cancer)
- Assess **surgical scars** (previous operations)

---

### Positioning and Exposure

**Patient Position**:
- **Supine** with one pillow under head
- Arms by sides (not folded over abdomen)
- **Expose from xiphisternum to pubic symphysis**
- Maintain dignity (cover chest, keep legs covered until pelvic examination)

---

### Inspection

**Stand at end of bed and observe**:

**Abdominal Shape**:
- **Distension**: Generalized (ascites, large ovarian cyst, pregnancy) vs localized (mass)
- **Asymmetry**: Unilateral mass (ovarian cyst)

**Scars**:
- **Pfannenstiel** (transverse suprapubic): Previous caesarean section, hysterectomy, ovarian cyst removal
- **Midline laparotomy**: Previous bowel surgery, large gynae operation
- **Laparoscopy ports**: Small scars at umbilicus + lower quadrants (diagnostic laparoscopy, sterilization, ectopic surgery)

**Skin Changes**:
- Striae (pregnancy, weight gain)
- Bruising (trauma, bleeding disorders)

**Masses**:
- **Visible mass** rising from pelvis (large ovarian cyst >12cm, fibroid uterus)

**Movements**:
- Visible peristalsis (bowel obstruction - not gynae)

---

### Palpation

**Light Palpation** (all 4 quadrants):
- Feel for **tenderness**
  - **Generalized tenderness + guarding**: Peritonitis (ruptured ectopic, ruptured ovarian cyst, PID with peritonitis)
  - **Localized tenderness**: RLQ (appendicitis, ovarian pathology), LLQ (ovarian pathology, diverticulitis)
- Feel for **superficial masses**

**Deep Palpation**:
- Palpate for **pelvic masses**:
  - Start at umbilicus, palpate downward toward pelvis
  - **Bimanually** (one hand abdominal, one hand pelvic during bimanual examination later) to assess mass

**Characteristics of Pelvic Mass on Abdominal Examination**:

| **Characteristic** | **Findings** | **Interpretation** |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **"Can't get below it"** | Mass continuous with pelvis, no lower border palpable | **Pelvic origin** (ovarian, uterine, bladder) |
| **Can get below it** | Can palpate lower border | **Abdominal origin** (not gynae) |
| **Mobility** | Fixed vs mobile | Mobile = ovarian cyst, Fixed = malignancy with adhesions |
| **Consistency** | Cystic (fluctuant) vs solid (firm/hard) | Cystic = ovarian cyst, Solid = fibroid |
| **Tender** | Painful on palpation | Torsion, infection, endometrioma |

---

### Percussion

**Why Percuss**:
- Detect **ascites** (ovarian cancer, liver disease)
- Distinguish **cystic** (dull) from **solid/gas** (resonant)

**Technique**:
- Percuss all 4 quadrants
- **Dull over mass** (fluid-filled or solid)
- **Shifting dullness**: Ascites (percuss from midline to flanks in supine position, then turn patient on side and repercuss - dullness shifts)

---

### Auscultation

**Bowel Sounds**:
- Usually not crucial for gynae examination
- Absent bowel sounds → Ileus (post-operative, peritonitis)

---

## Part 3: Speculum Examination

### Purpose

- **Visualize cervix** and vaginal walls
- Take **cervical screening test** (CST)
- Take **swabs** (endocervical for gonorrhoea/chlamydia, high vaginal for BV/candida/trichomonas)
- Assess for **discharge, bleeding, masses, prolapse**
- Identify **cervical pathology** (ectropion, polyp, cancer)

---

### Equipment

**Speculum Types**:

**Cusco Speculum** (Bivalve):
- Two blades that open like duck's bill
- **Most common** for cervical screening and visualization
- Self-retaining (stays open)
- Sizes: Small, medium, large

**Sims Speculum** (Single blade):
- Used to assess for **prolapse**
- Requires assistant or patient to hold
- Not self-retaining

**Which Size Speculum?**:
- **Nulliparous, young**: Small or medium Cusco
- **Parous, older**: Medium or large Cusco
- **Postmenopausal, atrophic vagina**: Small (use lubricant, be gentle)

---

### Preparation

**Explain to Patient**:
"I'm going to insert a speculum - it's a plastic/metal instrument that opens gently inside your vagina so I can see your cervix. You might feel some pressure but it shouldn't be painful. Please let me know if you're uncomfortable and I'll stop. Try to relax your muscles as much as possible - it will be more comfortable."

**Patient Position**:
- **Modified lithotomy**:
  - Supine
  - **Hips and knees flexed**
  - **Thighs abducted** (legs apart)
  - **Feet together** or on leg supports
  - **Bottom at edge of examination couch** (for adequate access)
- Cover patient with sheet over knees (maintain dignity)

**Warm Speculum**:
- Run under warm water (not hot)
- Or warm in hands

**Lubricant**:
- **If taking CST**: Use warm water ONLY (lubricant interferes with cytology)
- **If not taking CST**: Can use small amount of water-based lubricant on outside of blades

---

### Technique

**Inspect External Genitalia First**:
- Part labia gently with non-dominant hand
- Look for:
  - **Ulcers, warts, lumps** (HSV, HPV, VIN, cancer)
  - **Discharge at introitus** (BV, candida, trichomonas)
  - **Prolapse** (bulge from anterior/posterior vaginal wall)
  - **Atrophy** (thin, pale, dry mucosa - postmenopausal)

**Insert Speculum**:

**Step 1**:
- Hold speculum in dominant hand
- **Blades closed and vertical** (handle toward patient's side, not toward ceiling)
- Part labia with non-dominant hand
- **Insert gently at 45° angle** (pointing posteriorly toward sacrum, not straight in)
  - Avoids urethra (anterior)
  - Follows natural angle of vagina

**Step 2**:
- Advance speculum gently to full length (usually 6-8cm)
- **Rotate 90° clockwise** as you advance (blades now horizontal)

**Step 3**:
- **Open blades slowly**
- **Cervix should appear** between blades
- If not visible: Partially close, adjust angle (often need to angle more posteriorly), reopen
- **Lock speculum** in open position (lock mechanism on handle)

**Common Problem**: "Can't see cervix"
- **Too anterior**: Angle speculum more posteriorly
- **Too posterior**: Angle speculum more anteriorly
- **Not deep enough**: Advance further
- **Cervix to side**: Redirect laterally

---

### Inspect Cervix

**Normal Cervix Appearance**:
- **Nulliparous**: Small, round external os (dimple)
- **Parous**: Wider, slit-like external os
- **Color**: Pink (premenopausal), pale (postmenopausal)
- **Surface**: Smooth
- **Discharge**: Clear or white mucus

**Abnormal Findings**:

| **Finding** | **Appearance** | **Differential Diagnosis** |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| **Ectropion** (Cervical erosion) | Red area around os (columnar epithelium visible) | Normal variant, common in pregnancy/COCP, causes discharge/PCB |
| **Nabothian cysts** | Small white/yellow bumps on cervix | Benign retention cysts, normal variant |
| **Cervical polyp** | Red, grape-like mass protruding from os | Benign polyp (causes IMB/PCB), rarely malignant |
| **Contact bleeding** (bleeds when touched) | Cervix bleeds with gentle touch | Ectropion, cervicitis, **cervical cancer** |
| **Friable, irregular cervix** | Bleeds easily, irregular surface, mass | **Cervical cancer** (urgent colposcopy) |
| **Purulent discharge from os** | Yellow/green pus | **Cervicitis** (chlamydia, gonorrhoea - take swabs) |
| **Strawberry cervix** (petechiae) | Red pinpoint spots | **Trichomoniasis** |
| **Cervical stenosis** | Very small os, scarred | Previous LLETZ, cervical surgery |
| **Cervicitis** | Red, inflamed, discharge | Infection (STI), ectropion |

**CRITICAL Red Flag**:
- **Irregular, friable cervix with contact bleeding** = **Cervical cancer until proven otherwise** → Urgent referral for colposcopy and biopsy

---

### Inspect Vaginal Walls

**As You Withdraw Speculum**:
- Slowly close blades partially (maintain gentle opening)
- Slowly withdraw while inspecting vaginal walls

**Look For**:
- **Discharge**: Thick white (candida), grey thin fishy (BV), frothy yellow (trichomonas), blood
- **Inflammation**: Red, inflamed (vaginitis)
- **Ulcers, warts**: HSV, HPV
- **Prolapse**: Bulging of anterior wall (cystocele), posterior wall (rectocele), cervix descending (uterine prolapse)
- **Vaginal septum** (congenital anomaly)

---

### Remove Speculum

**Technique**:
- **Unlock** speculum
- **Begin to close blades BEFORE fully withdrawn** (avoid pinching cervix)
- **Rotate back to vertical** as you withdraw
- **Remove gently**

**After Removal**:
- Offer tissues for patient to clean
- Allow patient to dress in privacy
- Discard disposable speculum or place metal speculum in decontamination

---

### Taking Cervical Screening Test (CST)

**If Indicated** (age 25-74, due for 5-yearly screening):

**Equipment**:
- **Broom** (plastic brush) or **cytobrush + spatula**
- **Specimen container** with liquid preservative
- Label with patient details

**Technique**:
1. Visualize cervix with speculum
2. **Insert brush into cervical os** (central bristles in os)
3. **Rotate 360° clockwise 5 times** (ensures adequate sampling from transformation zone)
4. **Withdraw brush**
5. **Rinse in specimen container** (break off brush head into container, or swirl vigorously)
6. **Label and send** to laboratory

**If Taking Swabs** (for infections):
- **Endocervical swab** (for chlamydia/gonorrhoea NAAT): Insert swab into os, rotate, withdraw
- **High vaginal swab** (for BV/candida/trichomonas): Swab posterior vaginal fornix
- Place in appropriate transport medium

---

## Part 4: Bimanual Pelvic Examination

### Purpose

- **Palpate uterus**: Size, position, mobility, tenderness
- **Palpate adnexa** (ovaries and fallopian tubes): Masses, tenderness
- **Assess cervical excitation** (tenderness on moving cervix - suggests pelvic pathology)
- **Detect masses** (ovarian cyst, fibroid)
- **Assess for **prolapse, pelvic floor tone**

---

### Preparation

**Explain**:
"Now I'm going to examine you with my fingers. I'll insert two fingers into your vagina and press on your tummy with my other hand. This allows me to feel your womb and ovaries. You might feel some pressure, but it shouldn't be painful unless there's something tender. Please let me know if you're uncomfortable."

**Gloves**:
- Non-sterile gloves on both hands
- **Lubricate index and middle fingers** of dominant hand (water-based lubricant)

**Patient Position**:
- Same as speculum (modified lithotomy)
- **Relaxed** (ask patient to take deep breath and relax pelvic muscles)

---

### Technique

#### Step 1: Inspect External Genitalia (if not done during speculum)

- Part labia, inspect vulva

---

#### Step 2: Insert Fingers

**Fingers to Use**:
- **Index and middle fingers** of dominant hand (usually right hand)
- **Palm facing upward** (fingers curved anteriorly)

**Insertion**:
- Part labia with non-dominant hand
- **Insert two fingers gently** into vagina
- Angle **posteriorly** initially (45°), then advance horizontally
- Advance to full length (8-10cm)

---

#### Step 3: Assess Vagina

**As You Insert**:
- **Vaginal walls**: Smooth vs nodular (endometriosis nodules)
- **Pelvic floor tone**: Tight vs lax
- **Prolapse**: Bulging walls (ask patient to cough - accentuates prolapse)

---

#### Step 4: Palpate Cervix

**Locate Cervix**:
- Firm, round structure at apex of vagina (feels like "tip of nose")
- May be anterior, central, or posterior depending on uterine position

**Assess**:
- **Cervical os**: Open (parous) vs closed (nulliparous)
- **Consistency**: Firm (normal) vs soft (pregnant - "Hegar's sign")
- **Tenderness**: Gently move cervix side to side

**Cervical Excitation (Chandelier Sign)**:
- **Gently move cervix from side to side** with internal fingers
- **Positive cervical excitation** = **Patient experiences pain**
  - **Differential**: PID, ectopic pregnancy, ovarian torsion, appendicitis, endometriosis
  - Called "chandelier sign" (patient jumps up to touch the chandelier - hyperbole for severe pain)

**OSCE Statement**:
"I'm now going to assess for cervical excitation by gently moving the cervix."
[Move cervix gently side to side]
"There is cervical excitation - the patient experiences pain when I move the cervix. This suggests pelvic pathology such as PID, ectopic pregnancy, or ovarian pathology."

---

#### Step 5: Bimanual Palpation of Uterus

**Technique**:
- **Internal hand (vaginal fingers)**: Place in **anterior fornix** (in front of cervix), push cervix **posteriorly**
- **External hand (abdominal)**: Place suprapubically, press **downward and posteriorly** toward internal hand
- **"Trap" uterus between two hands** (bimanual palpation)

**Assess**:

**1. Size**:
- **Normal**: ~7-8cm long (size of small pear)
  - Nulliparous: Smaller
  - Parous: Slightly larger
- **Enlarged**:
  - **Weeks of pregnancy size** (e.g., "12-week size") → Pregnancy, fibroids
  - **Bulky** → Fibroids, adenomyosis

| **Uterine Size** | **Interpretation** |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Normal (7-8cm)** | Normal |
| **8-12 weeks size** | Early pregnancy, small fibroids, adenomyosis |
| **12-20 weeks size** | Pregnancy second trimester, large fibroids |
| **>20 weeks size** | Pregnancy late second/third trimester, very large fibroids, rarely sarcoma |

**2. Position**:
- **Anteverted** (normal): Uterus tilted anteriorly (toward bladder)
  - Cervix points posteriorly
  - Uterus palpable through anterior abdominal wall
- **Retroverted** (15-20% women): Uterus tilted posteriorly (toward rectum)
  - Cervix points anteriorly
  - Uterus palpable through posterior fornix (may need rectal examination)
  - **Normal variant** (not pathological)
- **Axial** (midline): Uterus vertical

**3. Mobility**:
- **Mobile** (normal): Can move uterus freely
- **Fixed** → Adhesions (endometriosis, PID, malignancy)

**4. Consistency**:
- **Firm** (normal)
- **Soft** (pregnancy - Hegar's sign)
- **Irregular, nodular** (fibroids)

**5. Tenderness**:
- **Non-tender** (normal)
- **Tender** → Adenomyosis, PID, endometriosis, degenerating fibroid

---

#### Step 6: Palpate Adnexa (Ovaries and Tubes)

**Technique**:
- **Internal fingers**: Move to **lateral fornix** (side of cervix)
- **External hand**: Move to **corresponding iliac fossa**
- **Press downward with external hand**, try to trap adnexal structures between hands
- Repeat on both sides (right and left adnexa)

**Normal Ovaries**:
- **Difficult to palpate** (small, mobile)
- If felt: Small (3x2x1cm), almond-shaped, slightly tender
- **Postmenopausal**: Should NOT be palpable (atrophied)

**Abnormal Findings**:

| **Finding** | **Interpretation** | **Differential Diagnosis** |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Palpable mass** | Ovarian cyst, ectopic, hydrosalpinx | **Postmenopausal palpable ovary** = **ovarian cancer until proven otherwise** |
| **Tender mass** | Ovarian cyst (especially if torsion), ectopic pregnancy, tubo-ovarian abscess (PID) | Needs ultrasound urgently |
| **Fixed mass** | Malignancy (ovarian cancer with adhesions), endometrioma | Needs imaging |
| **Bilateral tenderness** | PID | Clinical diagnosis + swabs |
| **Unilateral tenderness + mass** | Ovarian torsion, ectopic, hemorrhagic cyst | **Surgical emergency if torsion** |

**CRITICAL**:
- **Postmenopausal palpable ovary** = **Ovarian cancer until proven otherwise** → **Urgent ultrasound + CA125**

---

#### Step 7: Assess Pouch of Douglas (POD)

**Pouch of Douglas** = Space between uterus and rectum (rectouterine pouch)

**Technique**:
- **Internal fingers**: Place in **posterior fornix** (behind cervix)
- Feel for:
  - **Nodularity** (endometriosis deposits)
  - **Mass** (ovarian cyst, ectopic, abscess)
  - **Tenderness** (PID, endometriosis, ectopic)

**Fullness or Mass in POD**:
- Ectopic pregnancy (blood in POD)
- Pelvic abscess (tubo-ovarian abscess)
- Endometriosis (nodules)
- Ovarian cyst (posterior)

---

### Withdraw Fingers

- **Gently withdraw** fingers
- Offer tissues for patient to clean
- **Allow patient to dress in privacy**
- Dispose of gloves, wash hands

---

## Part 5: Interpretation of Findings

### Integrating Examination with History

**History: Heavy Menstrual Bleeding**

**Examination Findings** | **Interpretation**
---|---
**Enlarged, irregular uterus (12-week size), non-tender** | **Fibroids** (leiomyoma)
**Bulky, tender uterus (10-week size)** | **Adenomyosis**
**Normal size uterus** | Dysfunctional uterine bleeding, bleeding disorder (vWD), anovulation, endometrial pathology (polyp, hyperplasia) - needs imaging/biopsy

---

**History: Pelvic Pain**

**Examination Findings** | **Interpretation**
---|---
**Cervical excitation + adnexal tenderness (bilateral)** | **PID** (pelvic inflammatory disease)
**Cervical excitation + unilateral adnexal mass + tenderness** | **Ectopic pregnancy** (if missed period) or **ovarian torsion** or **ruptured ovarian cyst**
**Uterine tenderness, bulky uterus** | **Adenomyosis**
**Nodularity in POD, fixed retroverted uterus** | **Endometriosis**
**Rigid, fixed adnexal mass** | **Ovarian cancer** (with adhesions)

---

**History: Vaginal Discharge**

**Examination Findings** | **Interpretation**
---|---
**Cervix normal, thin grey vaginal discharge, fishy odor** | **Bacterial vaginosis** (BV)
**Cervix normal, thick white "cottage cheese" discharge, vulval erythema** | **Candidiasis** (thrush)
**Purulent discharge from cervical os, cervical excitation** | **Cervicitis** (chlamydia, gonorrhoea) ± PID
**Frothy yellow-green discharge, "strawberry cervix"** | **Trichomoniasis**
**Cervical ectropion, clear mucus** | **Physiological** (ectropion causes increased discharge)

---

**History: Postmenopausal Bleeding**

**Examination Findings** | **Interpretation**
---|---
**Friable, irregular cervix, contact bleeding** | **Cervical cancer** (urgent colposcopy)
**Atrophic vagina, pale thin mucosa, small cervix** | **Atrophic vaginitis** (most common cause PMB, but must exclude endometrial cancer with imaging/biopsy)
**Cervical polyp** | **Cervical polyp** (usually benign, but biopsy needed)

---

## Part 6: Common IMG Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Not Offering Chaperone

**What IMGs Do Wrong**:
- Forget to offer chaperone
- Think it's not needed if examiner is female

**Correct Approach**:
- **Always offer chaperone** for intimate examination (regardless of examiner gender)
- Document if declined
- **In OSCE**: State clearly "I would offer a chaperone" even if simulated patient/mannequin

**Why It Matters**:
- Medicolegal protection
- Patient comfort
- Professional standards (AHPRA, Medical Board)

---

### Mistake 2: Not Explaining Procedure Before Examination

**What IMGs Do Wrong**:
- Start examination without explaining
- Assume patient knows what you're doing

**Correct Approach**:
- **Explain speculum and bimanual examination** before starting
- Use simple language, not medical jargon
- "I'll insert a speculum to see your cervix, then examine with my fingers"
- **Obtain verbal consent**: "Is that alright with you?"

---

### Mistake 3: Inserting Speculum Horizontally (Wrong Angle)

**What IMGs Do Wrong**:
- Insert speculum straight in (horizontally) → Hits anterior vaginal wall/urethra → Painful

**Correct Approach**:
- **Insert at 45° angle** (pointing posteriorly toward sacrum)
- **Follows natural angle of vagina**
- Rotate to horizontal once inserted

---

### Mistake 4: Not Warming Speculum

**What IMGs Do Wrong**:
- Use cold metal speculum → Very uncomfortable for patient

**Correct Approach**:
- **Warm speculum** under warm water or in hands
- **Or use disposable plastic speculum** (warmer than metal)

---

### Mistake 5: Using Lubricant When Taking Cervical Screening Test

**What IMGs Do Wrong**:
- Apply lubricant to speculum before CST → Interferes with cytology result

**Correct Approach**:
- **If taking CST**: Use **warm water only** (no lubricant)
- If NOT taking CST: Can use small amount of water-based lubricant

---

### Mistake 6: Not Assessing for Cervical Excitation

**What IMGs Do Wrong**:
- Perform bimanual without testing cervical excitation
- Miss critical finding in acute pelvic pain

**Correct Approach**:
- **Always assess cervical excitation** in patient with pelvic pain
- **Gently move cervix side to side** with vaginal fingers
- Positive = pain = suggests PID, ectopic, torsion, appendicitis

---

### Mistake 7: Trying to Palpate Normal Ovaries in Postmenopausal Woman

**What IMGs Do Wrong**:
- State "I palpated normal ovaries" in 65-year-old woman

**Correct Approach**:
- **Postmenopausal ovaries should NOT be palpable** (atrophied)
- **If palpable** = **ovarian cancer until proven otherwise**
- Correct statement: "The adnexa were not palpable, which is normal for postmenopausal women"

---

### Mistake 8: Not Recognizing Red Flags

**What IMGs Do Wrong**:
- See irregular cervix → Don't recognize as potential cancer
- Palpate postmenopausal ovary → Don't recognize urgency

**Correct Approach**:
**RED FLAGS - Recognize and Act**:
- **Irregular, friable cervix with contact bleeding** → **Cervical cancer** → Urgent colposcopy
- **Postmenopausal palpable ovary** → **Ovarian cancer** → Urgent ultrasound + CA125
- **Cervical excitation + missed period** → **Ectopic pregnancy** → Urgent βhCG + ultrasound
- **Unilateral tender mass** → **Ovarian torsion** → **Surgical emergency**

---

## Part 7: OSCE Practice Station

### OSCE Station: Gynaecological Examination - Pelvic Pain

**Candidate Instructions**:
"Ms. Thompson is a 25-year-old woman presenting with lower abdominal pain for 3 days. She is sexually active. Perform an appropriate gynaecological examination. A mannequin will be used. You have 8 minutes."

**Examiner Instructions** (what you should know):
- Patient has bilateral adnexal tenderness and cervical excitation
- Diagnosis: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)

**Approach** (Model Performance):

**Introduction and Consent** (1 minute):
"Hello Ms. Thompson, I'm Dr. [Name]. I understand you've been having lower tummy pain for 3 days. To find out what's causing this, I'd like to examine your tummy and perform an internal examination. The internal examination involves inserting a speculum to look at your cervix, and then examining with my fingers to feel your womb and ovaries. Is that alright with you?"
[Patient agrees]

"Would you like a female nurse to be present as a chaperone during the examination?"
[Patient declines]
"That's fine. Can I ask you to empty your bladder first? The toilet is just outside."
[Patient returns]
"Thank you. I'm going to wash my hands now."

**Positioning** (30 seconds):
"Can I ask you to lie back on the examination couch? I'll need to examine your tummy first, so I'll need to expose from below your breasts to your pubic bone."
[Position patient, expose abdomen appropriately]

**Abdominal Examination** (1.5 minutes):

**Inspection**:
"On inspection, the abdomen appears flat with no visible masses or scars."

**Palpation**:
"I'm going to feel your tummy now. Please let me know if anywhere is tender."
[Light palpation all 4 quadrants]
"There is tenderness in both lower quadrants, more on the left than right. There is no guarding or rigidity, which is reassuring."
[Deep palpation]
"I don't palpate any masses arising from the pelvis."

**Percussion**:
[Percuss briefly]
"Percussion is normal with no evidence of ascites."

**Auscultation**:
"Bowel sounds are present and normal."

**Summary**:
"The abdominal examination shows bilateral lower quadrant tenderness without peritonism."

**Prepare for Pelvic Examination** (1 minute):
"Thank you. Now I'd like to perform the internal examination. Can I ask you to remove your underwear and lie back with your knees bent and legs apart? I'll cover you with this sheet for your dignity. Your bottom needs to be right at the edge of the couch."
[Position patient in modified lithotomy, cover with sheet]

"I'm going to warm the speculum under this warm water."
[Warm speculum]
"Put on gloves"
[Don gloves]

**Speculum Examination** (2 minutes):

"I'm going to insert the speculum now. You'll feel some pressure but it shouldn't be painful. Please try to relax your muscles. Take a deep breath in and out for me."
[Insert speculum - describe actions]

"The speculum is inserted. I'm now going to open it gently to visualize your cervix."
[Open speculum]

**Inspect Cervix**:
"I can see the cervix. It appears normal in size and shape with a closed os, consistent with nulliparous status. The cervix is pink and smooth with no signs of ectropion, polyp, or malignancy. There is no contact bleeding. I can see a small amount of mucopurulent discharge at the os, which could indicate cervicitis."

**Inspect Vagina**:
[Begin to withdraw speculum slowly]
"As I withdraw the speculum, I'm inspecting the vaginal walls. The vaginal walls appear normal with no ulceration, masses, or prolapse."

[Remove speculum, discard, remove gloves, don new gloves]

**Bimanual Examination** (2.5 minutes):

"Now I'm going to examine you with my fingers. I'll insert two fingers into your vagina and press on your tummy with my other hand. You'll feel some pressure."
[Lubricate fingers, insert]

"The vaginal walls feel normal."

**Palpate Cervix**:
"I can feel the cervix. It's firm and closed."
"I'm now going to assess for cervical excitation by gently moving the cervix."
[Gently move cervix side to side]
"**There is cervical excitation - Ms. Thompson experiences pain when I move the cervix. This is a significant finding.**"

**Bimanual - Uterus**:
"I'm now placing my fingers in front of the cervix and pressing on the tummy with my other hand to feel the womb."
[Bimanual palpation]
"The uterus is normal size, anteverted, mobile, and non-tender."

**Bimanual - Adnexa**:
"I'm now going to examine each side to feel the ovaries."
[Palpate right adnexa]
"On the right side, I feel **tenderness in the right adnexa**. I don't palpate a discrete mass."
[Palpate left adnexa]
"On the left side, I also feel **tenderness in the left adnexa**, more marked than the right. I don't palpate a discrete mass."

**Pouch of Douglas**:
"I'm examining behind the womb now."
[Palpate POD]
"There is some fullness and tenderness in the Pouch of Douglas."

[Withdraw fingers gently]
"I'm finished now. Let me help you clean up."
[Offer tissues, allow patient to dress]

**Presentation to Examiner** (1 minute):

"Ms. Thompson is a 25-year-old sexually active woman presenting with 3 days of lower abdominal pain.

On abdominal examination, there is bilateral lower quadrant tenderness without peritonism.

On pelvic examination:
- **Speculum**: Cervix appears normal in appearance, but there is mucopurulent discharge at the os suggesting cervicitis
- **Bimanual**:
  - **Positive cervical excitation** (pain on moving cervix)
  - **Bilateral adnexal tenderness** (left > right)
  - No palpable adnexal masses
  - Normal size, mobile uterus
  - Fullness and tenderness in Pouch of Douglas

**Interpretation**:
These findings are consistent with **pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)** - likely sexually transmitted infection (chlamydia or gonorrhoea) causing cervicitis that has ascended to cause salpingitis and peritonitis.

**Management**:
1. **Swabs**: Endocervical swabs for chlamydia and gonorrhoea NAAT, high vaginal swab
2. **Bloods**: FBC, CRP, pregnancy test (exclude ectopic)
3. **Treatment**: Empiric antibiotics (Australian guidelines - ceftriaxone 500mg IM stat + doxycycline 100mg BD 14 days + metronidazole 400mg BD 14 days)
4. **Contact tracing**: Partner notification and treatment
5. **Screen for other STIs**: HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis
6. **Advise**: Abstain from intercourse until treatment completed and partner treated
7. **Follow-up**: Review in 3 days to ensure responding to treatment, repeat swabs to ensure clearance

**Differential diagnosis to consider**:
- Ectopic pregnancy (would need pregnancy test urgently - positive cervical excitation can also be seen in ectopic)
- Appendicitis (but would expect more right-sided findings)
- Ovarian cyst (torsion or rupture - but no discrete mass palpated)"

## Summary: Key Takeaways

### For Gynaecological Examination:
1. **Always offer chaperone** (document if declined)
2. **Explain procedure and obtain consent** before starting
3. **Systematic approach**: Abdominal examination → Speculum → Bimanual

### For Speculum Examination:
1. **Warm speculum** (water, not lubricant if taking CST)
2. **Insert at 45° angle posteriorly** (not straight)
3. **Inspect cervix systematically**: Size, os, color, surface, discharge, bleeding
4. **Red flag**: Irregular friable cervix with contact bleeding = **cervical cancer**

### For Bimanual Examination:
1. **Insert two fingers** (index and middle), palm up
2. **Assess cervical excitation** (gently move cervix side to side - pain = pathology)
3. **Bimanual palpation**: Trap uterus/adnexa between internal and external hands
4. **Assess**: Size, position, mobility, consistency, tenderness (uterus and adnexa)

### Key Findings:
1. **Cervical excitation + adnexal tenderness** = **PID** or **ectopic pregnancy**
2. **Enlarged irregular uterus** = **Fibroids**
3. **Bulky tender uterus** = **Adenomyosis**
4. **Postmenopausal palpable ovary** = **Ovarian cancer until proven otherwise**
5. **Mucopurulent discharge from os** = **Cervicitis** (chlamydia/gonorrhoea)

### For OSCE Success:
1. **State what you're doing**: "I'm now assessing for cervical excitation..."
2. **Interpret findings**: Don't just say "cervical excitation" - say "Positive cervical excitation, indicating pelvic pathology such as PID or ectopic"
3. **Relate to differential**: "These findings are consistent with PID given..."
4. **Always mention chaperone**: Even if simulated/mannequin
5. **Maintain dignity**: Cover patient appropriately, allow privacy to dress
6. **Recognize red flags**: Irregular cervix, postmenopausal palpable ovary
