## INTRODUCTION

### Examination Driven by Differential (Dr. Amir's Approach)

**Traditional approach**: Do complete examination → Think about findings

**Dr. Amir's approach**: Know your differential from history → Examination CONFIRMS or EXCLUDES each differential → Findings narrow diagnosis

**Example**:
- History suggests appendicitis
- **Examination purpose**: Confirm localized RLQ tenderness, rule out peritonitis, rule out other causes
- **You're looking for**: McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, rebound (local vs generalized), psoas sign, obturator sign

### The 5 Ps Framework

**P**reparation
**P**osition
**P**ermission
**P**erform (Inspection → Palpation → Percussion → Auscultation)
**P**resent

---

## THE 5 Ps FRAMEWORK

### **P1: PREPARATION** (15 seconds)

**What to Say**:
"I'm going to examine your abdomen. This will involve me looking at and feeling your tummy. Is that okay?"

**Actions**:
- Wash hands / hand sanitizer (ALWAYS - examiner watching)
- Ensure privacy (draw curtain, close door)
- Chaperone offered (especially male doctor, female patient)
- Adequate lighting
- Equipment ready: Stethoscope

---

### **P2: POSITION** (15 seconds)

**What to Say**:
"Can you lie flat on the bed for me, with your arms by your sides? I'll need to examine from here *[indicate chest]* to here *[indicate pelvis]*."

**Patient Position**:
- **Lying flat (supine)**
- One pillow under head (comfortable, but not too propped up)
- Arms by sides (NOT folded across chest - tenses abdomen)
- Exposure: **Nipples to knees** (need to see full abdomen, groins, and potentially examine hernial orifices)

**Examiner Position**:
- Stand on patient's RIGHT side
- At level of patient's abdomen (not at head or feet)

**Examiner Note**: In OSCE, patient usually already positioned. Just check positioning is correct.

---

### **P3: PERMISSION** (10 seconds)

**What to Say**:
"Before I start, are you in any pain right now?"

*[Patient points to area]*

"Okay, I'll examine that area last so I don't cause you unnecessary discomfort."

**Why This Matters**:
- Shows compassion
- **Tactical**: If you palpate painful area first, patient will guard throughout rest of examination (muscle tension)
- **Correct approach**: Palpate painful area LAST

---

### **P4: PERFORM - INSPECTION** (30-45 seconds)

**What to Say**:
"I'm going to start by looking at your abdomen."

**Stand at foot of bed** (better view of symmetry, contours)

---

#### **4A: GENERAL INSPECTION**

**Look at Patient as Whole**:
- Does patient look unwell? (Septic, shocked, in pain)
- **Position**: Lying still (peritonitis) vs writhing (renal colic)
- Colour: Pale (anaemia, shock), jaundiced (biliary pathology)

---

#### **4B: INSPECTION OF ABDOMEN**

**Systematic Approach - Walk Around Bed if Needed**:

**1. SHAPE & CONTOUR**:
- **Flat** (normal)
- **Scaphoid** (concave - malnutrition, elderly)
- **Distended** (generalized or localized)
  - **Generalized distension**: 5 Fs
    - **F**latus (bowel obstruction)
    - **F**luid (ascites)
    - **F**etus (pregnancy)
    - **F**at (obesity)
    - **F**eces (severe constipation)
  - **Localized distension**: Mass, organomegaly, hernia

**2. SCARS**:
- Indicates previous surgery → Adhesions (cause of bowel obstruction)
- **Common scars**:
  - Midline (laparotomy)
  - Right subcostal (cholecystectomy - open)
  - Paramedian
  - Pfannenstiel (C-section, gynae surgery)
  - Laparoscopic port sites (small, often in umbilicus + RUQ/LUQ)
  - Appendicectomy (RLQ - McBurney's point or laparoscopic)

**What to Say**: "I can see you've had previous surgery *[indicate scar]*. What operation was that?"

**3. SKIN CHANGES**:
- **Striae** (stretch marks - pregnancy, Cushing's, rapid weight change)
- **Dilated veins** (caput medusae - portal hypertension)
- **Erythema** (cellulitis, herpes zoster)
- **Bruising**:
  - **Grey Turner's sign** (flank bruising) - Haemorrhagic pancreatitis, retroperitoneal bleed
  - **Cullen's sign** (periumbilical bruising) - Haemorrhagic pancreatitis, ruptured ectopic

**4. HERNIAS** (Look before you palpate):
- **Umbilical hernia**: Protrusion at umbilicus
- **Incisional hernia**: At scar site
- **Inguinal hernia**: Groin swelling
- **Femoral hernia**: Below inguinal ligament

**What to Say**: "Can you cough for me please?" *[Watch for hernia appearing/enlarging on cough impulse]*

**5. VISIBLE MASSES**:
- Large masses may be visible (AAA pulsation, large tumor)

**6. MOVEMENT WITH RESPIRATION**:
- Abdomen should rise and fall with breathing
- **Absent movement** → Peritonitis (patient breathing with chest only, abdomen rigid)

---

### **P4: PERFORM - PALPATION** (3-4 minutes)

**This is the MOST important part of abdominal examination**

---

#### **4C: LIGHT PALPATION**

**Purpose**: Assess for tenderness, guarding, masses

**Technique**:
- **Kneel or bend** so your hand is horizontal to patient's abdomen (not pressing down from height)
- **Watch patient's face** (while palpating - see pain reaction)
- **Use flat of hand** (not fingertips - less uncomfortable)
- **Gentle pressure** (2-3 cm depth)

**What to Say**:
"I'm going to feel your tummy gently. Let me know if any area is tender."

**Systematic Approach - 9 Regions** (or 4 quadrants):
Start in region FURTHEST from pain, work towards painful area

**9 Regions**:
1. Right hypochondrium
2. Epigastrium
3. Left hypochondrium
4. Right lumbar
5. Umbilical
6. Left lumbar
7. Right iliac fossa
8. Suprapubic
9. Left iliac fossa

**What You're Feeling For**:
- **Tenderness**: Patient winces, says "ow"
- **Guarding**: Involuntary muscle contraction (abdomen tenses when you palpate)
  - **Voluntary guarding**: Patient tenses (anticipating pain) - throughout abdomen
  - **Involuntary guarding**: Reflex muscle contraction - localized to area of inflammation
- **Rigidity**: Board-like hardness - indicates peritonitis

---

#### **4D: DEEP PALPATION**

**Purpose**: Feel for masses, organomegaly

**Technique**:
- Use one hand on top of other (for more pressure)
- Deeper pressure (5-6 cm)
- Same 9-region systematic approach

**What to Say**:
"Now I'm going to feel a bit deeper. Again, let me know if anything hurts."

**What You're Feeling For**:
- **Masses**: Describe by 7 Ss (see below)
- **Organomegaly**: Liver, spleen, kidneys (see below)

---

#### **4E: PALPATION OF ORGANS**

**LIVER** (Right Hypochondrium):

**Technique**:
- Start in RLF (right iliac fossa)
- Hand parallel to right costal margin
- Ask patient to "take a deep breath in"
- Feel for liver edge descending onto your fingers
- Move hand up 2cm, repeat, until reach costal margin

**What to Say**: "I'm going to feel for your liver. Take a deep breath in for me."

**Normal**: Liver edge not palpable (OR just palpable at costal margin in thin patients / on deep inspiration)

**Abnormal - Hepatomegaly**:
- Palpable >2 cm below costal margin
- **Causes in acute abdomen**: Hepatitis, liver abscess, hepatic congestion (CCF), metastases

**If liver enlarged - describe**:
- Size (cm below costal margin)
- Edge (smooth or nodular)
- Consistency (soft, firm, hard)
- Tenderness (tender in hepatitis, abscess)
- Pulsatile (TR - tricuspid regurgitation)

**SPLEEN** (Left Hypochondrium):

**Technique**:
- Start in RIF (right iliac fossa) - yes, right (spleen enlarges diagonally towards RIF)
- Hand parallel to left costal margin
- Ask patient to deep breath in
- Feel for spleen edge
- If not felt: Ask patient to roll onto right side (brings spleen forward) - repeat

**What to Say**: "Now I'm checking for your spleen. Deep breath in."

**Normal**: Spleen not palpable

**Abnormal - Splenomegaly**:
- Palpable below left costal margin
- **Causes in acute abdomen**: Splenic rupture (trauma), splenic infarct, infectious mononucleosis (rare)

**KIDNEYS** (Lumbar regions):

**Technique - Bimanual Ballottement**:
- Place one hand in renal angle (posteriorly in flank)
- Place other hand anteriorly in lumbar region
- **Ballot** kidney between two hands (push from back, catch anteriorly)
- Do for both kidneys

**What to Say**: "I'm checking your kidneys now."

**Normal**: Kidneys usually not palpable (except thin patients, right kidney sometimes)

**Abnormal**:
- Palpable enlarged kidney - Hydronephrosis (obstructed), polycystic kidney disease, tumor
- **Tender** - Pyelonephritis, renal stone

**BLADDER** (Suprapubic):

**Palpate suprapubic region**

**Normal**: Not palpable (unless full)

**Abnormal - Palpable bladder**:
- Urinary retention (palpable, dull to percussion)

**ABDOMINAL AORTA** (Midline, epigastric):

**Technique**:
- Palpate deeply in epigastric region, just left of midline
- Feel for pulsation
- **Assess width** (place fingers on either side of aorta, measure width)

**What to Say**: "I'm checking the main blood vessel in your abdomen."

**Normal**: Pulsation felt, width <3 cm

**Abnormal - AAA**:
- **Expansile pulsation** (pushes fingers apart, not just up and down)
- Width >3 cm (AAA definition)
- **CRITICAL**: If palpable AAA + abdominal pain → Think ruptured AAA

**IMPORTANT**: In thin patients, normal aortic pulsation is easily felt - don't panic. AAA is EXPANSILE (sideways) and WIDE.

---

#### **4F: PALPATION OF REBOUND TENDERNESS**

**This tests for peritonitis**

**Technique**:
- Press down gently (2-3 cm) over area of tenderness
- **Hold for 2-3 seconds**
- **Quickly release**
- **Positive** = Pain is WORSE on release than on pressing down (rebound tenderness)

**What to Say**: "I'm going to press down here and then let go quickly. Tell me which hurts more - when I press down, or when I let go."

**Interpretation**:
- **Positive rebound** = Peritoneal inflammation (peritonitis)
- **Localized rebound** (RLQ only) = Localized peritonitis (appendicitis, diverticulitis)
- **Generalized rebound** (all quadrants) = Generalized peritonitis (perforated viscus)

**GENTLER ALTERNATIVE** (if patient clearly in pain):
- **Percussion tenderness** (see below) - less painful way to assess peritoneal inflammation
- **Cough test**: "Does it hurt when you cough?" (peritoneal inflammation)
- **Shaking bed**: Gently shake bed - if patient winces, indicates peritonitis

**NOTE**: Some examiners dislike rebound testing (too painful). Know it, but use gentler methods in OSCE unless specifically instructed.

---

### **P4: PERFORM - PERCUSSION** (1-2 minutes)

**Purpose**:
- Assess for fluid (ascites)
- Assess for air (obstruction, perforation)
- Assess organomegaly
- Gentler way to assess peritoneal inflammation

**Technique**:
- Place middle finger of left hand flat on abdomen (pleximeter)
- Tap with middle finger of right hand (plexor)
- Listen to sound
  - **Resonant** (normal - air-filled bowel)
  - **Dull** (solid organ, fluid, mass)
  - **Tympanic** (gas-filled - obstruction)

**What to Say**: "I'm going to tap on your abdomen to check for fluid."

---

#### **4G: PERCUSSION - 9 REGIONS**

**Percuss same 9 regions**:
- **Liver**: Dull in right hypochondrium (normal)
- **Spleen**: Dull in left hypochondrium if enlarged
- **Hollow viscera**: Resonant (stomach, bowel)
- **Bladder**: Dull suprapubically if full

**SPECIFIC FINDING**:
- **Loss of liver dullness** (resonant where should be dull)
  - **Indicates**: Pneumoperitoneum (perforated viscus - free air displaces liver)

---

#### **4H: PERCUSSION FOR ASCITES**

**Shifting Dullness** (Most reliable clinical test for ascites):

**Technique**:
1. Percuss from **midline (umbilicus) towards flank**
2. Sounds changes from **resonant (midline) → dull (flank)**
3. Mark transition point
4. Ask patient to **roll onto side** (towards you)
5. **Wait 30 seconds** (for fluid to shift)
6. Percuss again at same point
7. **Positive test**: Area that was dull is now resonant (fluid has shifted away)

**Interpretation**:
- **Shifting dullness present** = Ascites (at least 1-2 litres)
- **Causes in acute abdomen**: Perforation (free fluid), pancreatitis (fluid), liver disease, malignancy

---

### **P4: PERFORM - AUSCULTATION** (30 seconds)

**Purpose**: Assess bowel sounds

**Technique**:
- Place stethoscope **in RLQ** (ileocaecal area - most active)
- Listen for **5-10 seconds minimum** (don't rush)

**What to Say**: "I'm going to listen to your bowel sounds."

**Normal**:
- Bowel sounds present (gurgling every 5-10 seconds)

**Abnormal**:

**Absent / Very Reduced**:
- **Ileus** (bowel not moving)
- **Peritonitis** (bowel shuts down)
- **Advanced obstruction**
- **Need to listen for 2 minutes** to declare truly absent (but in OSCE, 30 seconds is acceptable)

**High-Pitched / Tinkling**:
- **Bowel obstruction** (bowel trying to push against obstruction)

**Increased / Hyperactive**:
- **Gastroenteritis** (increased motility)
- **Early obstruction** (increased peristalsis trying to overcome)

**Vascular Bruits**:
- Listen over **aorta** (midline, epigastric)
- Listen over **renal arteries** (left and right of umbilicus)
- **Bruit** = Stenosis or aneurysm
- In acute abdomen: AAA may have bruit

---

## SPECIAL TESTS FOR SPECIFIC DIFFERENTIALS

### For APPENDICITIS

**1. McBurney's Point Tenderness**:
- Point: **2/3 from umbilicus to ASIS** (anterior superior iliac spine)
- **Maximum tenderness** at this point = Appendicitis

---

### For CHOLECYSTITIS

**Murphy's Sign**:
- Place hand **below right costal margin**
- Ask patient to **take deep breath in**
- Liver descends, pushing inflamed gallbladder onto your hand
- **Positive**: Patient **stops breathing in** due to pain (arrest of inspiration)
- **Indicates**: Cholecystitis

---

### For PERITONITIS

- More common in thin patients

**Tinkling Bowel Sounds**:
- High-pitched, frequent

**Distension**:
- Generalized abdominal distension

**Hernial Orifices**:
- **MUST EXAMINE** for incarcerated hernia (cause of obstruction)

---

### For AAA

**Palpable Pulsatile Mass**:
- Epigastric, midline
- **Expansile** pulsation (pushes fingers apart laterally, not just up/down)
- Width >3 cm

**Bruit**:
- Auscultate over AAA

---

### COMPLETE EXAMINATION

**At end of abdomen examination, say to examiner**:

"To complete my examination, I would like to:
- **Examine hernial orifices** (inguinal, femoral, umbilical - if not already done)
- **Perform digital rectal examination** (if indicated - e.g., suspected GI bleeding, pelvic mass)
- **Examine external genitalia** (if indicated)
- Assess **peripheral pulses** (if concerned about vascular pathology)
- Check **observations** (HR, BP, temperature, RR, O2 sats)
- Perform **urinalysis** (blood, protein, nitrites, leukocytes)"

## ACUTE ABDOMEN - CRITICAL FINDINGS

### Recognize These Immediately

**PERITONITIS**:
- Board-like rigidity
- Generalized guarding and rebound
- Absent bowel sounds
- Patient lies still
- **→ Perforated viscus → URGENT SURGERY**

**SHOCK** (Ruptured AAA, Ruptured Ectopic, Severe Pancreatitis):
- Hypotension
- Tachycardia
- Cold peripheries
- Delayed capillary refill
- **→ RESUSCITATE + URGENT INTERVENTION**

**BOWEL OBSTRUCTION**:
- Distension
- Tinkling bowel sounds
- Tender mass in hernial orifice (incarcerated hernia)
- **If peritonitis** → Strangulated bowel → URGENT SURGERY

**AAA**:
- Palpable expansile pulsatile mass
- **If + hypotension** → Ruptured AAA → ACTIVATE MASSIVE TRANSFUSION + OR

---

## INTEGRATION: HOW EXAMINATION FINDINGS NARROW YOUR DIFFERENTIAL

### Case Example

**History**: 35F, RLQ pain for 12 hours, started centrally then migrated, anorexia, vomiting after pain started, low-grade fever

**Differential from History**:
1. Appendicitis
2. Ectopic pregnancy (must exclude)
3. Ovarian pathology
4. IBD
5. Renal stone

**Examination Findings**:
- Lying still
- RLQ tenderness maximal at McBurney's point
- Localized guarding RLQ
- Rovsing's sign POSITIVE
- Rebound tenderness localized to RLQ
- Normal bowel sounds
- No masses palpable
- Temperature 38.1°C

**How Examination Narrows Differential**:

✅ **Appendicitis** - Most likely (localized RLQ tenderness, McBurney's point, Rovsing's +ve, fever, appropriate history)

❌ **Ectopic pregnancy** - Less likely (would need βHCG to exclude, but exam doesn't suggest ruptured ectopic - no shock, no generalized peritonitis from haemoperitoneum)

❌ **Ovarian pathology** - Less likely (tenderness at McBurney's point is too medial for ovary, positive Rovsing's more consistent with appendicitis)

❌ **IBD** - Less likely (acute presentation, no chronic history, exam findings localized to appendix)

❌ **Renal stone** - Excluded (patient lying still [stone patients writhe], no loin tenderness, tenderness at McBurney's not loin-to-groin)

**Your Final Differential After Examination**:
1. **Acute appendicitis** (most likely)
2. Ectopic pregnancy (must still exclude with βHCG)

**Your Management**:
- Bloods: FBC, CRP, βHCG (to exclude ectopic)
- Imaging: CT abdomen if diagnosis unclear (but this is classic appendicitis clinically)
- **Surgical consult for appendicectomy**
