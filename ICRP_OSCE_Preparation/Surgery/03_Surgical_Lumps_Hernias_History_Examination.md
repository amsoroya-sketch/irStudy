## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. **Take a focused history** for a patient presenting with a lump or hernia using the differential-driven approach
2. **Perform systematic physical examination** of lumps (7 Ss framework) and hernias (inspection, palpation, reducibility)
3. **Generate differential diagnosis** from the first moment and narrow it with each finding
4. **Identify red flags** requiring urgent surgical referral
5. **Integrate history and examination** to arrive at a working diagnosis
6. **Apply Australian healthcare context** (eTG 2024, Medicare, PBS, surgical referral pathways)

## Dr. Amir Soufi's Core Principle Applied to Lumps & Hernias

### The Differential-Driven Mindset

**Traditional Approach (WRONG for OSCE)**:
1. Patient: "I have a lump in my neck"
2. You: Take full history methodically
3. You: Examine the lump
4. You: Think about diagnosis at the end

**Dr. Amir's Approach (CORRECT for OSCE)**:
1. Patient: "I have a lump in my neck"
2. **You IMMEDIATELY think**: "Differential for neck lump = Lymph node (infection vs malignancy), Thyroid nodule, Lipoma, Sebaceous cyst, Branchial cyst, Cystic hygroma, Carotid body tumor"
3. **Your next questions are DRIVEN by differentials**:
   - "Any fever, night sweats, weight loss?" (lymphoma)
   - "Any voice change, difficulty swallowing?" (thyroid)
   - "Any recent infections?" (reactive lymph node)
   - "How long has it been there?" (congenital vs acquired)
4. **Each answer NARROWS your differential**
5. **Examination confirms your working diagnosis**

**This is how consultants think. This is how you must think in OSCE.**

## Part 1: History-Taking for Lumps

### Framework: "LUMP" + Differential Thinking

#### L - **LOCATION** (Site and Radiation)

**Opening Question**: "Where exactly is the lump? Can you point to it?"

**Differential Thinking by Location**:

**Neck Lumps**:
- **Anterior midline**: Thyroid nodule, thyroglossal cyst (moves with swallowing/tongue protrusion)
- **Anterior triangle**: Lymph nodes, branchial cyst, submandibular gland pathology
- **Posterior triangle**: Lymph nodes (supraclavicular = consider malignancy), cystic hygroma
- **Lateral**: Lymph nodes, carotid body tumor (pulsatile)

**Groin Lumps**:
- **Above and medial to pubic tubercle**: Inguinal hernia
- **Below and lateral to pubic tubercle**: Femoral hernia
- **Lateral to pubic tubercle**: Lymph nodes, saphena varix (disappears on lying), femoral aneurysm (pulsatile)
- **Scrotal**: Hydrocele, varicocele, testicular mass

**Abdominal Wall Lumps**:
- **Epigastric**: Epigastric hernia, lipoma
- **Umbilical**: Umbilical hernia, Sister Mary Joseph nodule (metastatic malignancy)
- **Incisional**: Incisional hernia (previous surgery)
- **Spigelian**: Spigelian hernia (lateral edge of rectus)

**Breast Lumps**:
- Upper outer quadrant (most common site for cancer)
- Subareolar (duct ectasia, papilloma)
- Axillary tail

**Skin Lumps**:
- **Scalp/face/trunk**: Sebaceous cyst, lipoma, dermatofibroma, BCC, SCC, melanoma
- **Extremities**: Ganglion cyst (wrist), lipoma, neurofibroma

**Your Follow-up Questions Based on Location**:
- **Neck**: "Does it move when you swallow?" (thyroid), "Does it move when you stick your tongue out?" (thyroglossal cyst)
- **Groin**: "Does it come down when you cough or strain?" (hernia), "Does it disappear when you lie down?" (hernia vs fixed mass)
- **Scrotal**: "Can you get above it?" (hydrocele vs inguinoscrotal hernia)

---

#### U - **UNDERSTANDING the Timeline** (Onset, Duration, Progression)

**Key Questions**:
1. "When did you first notice the lump?"
2. "Has it been there since birth, or did it appear later?"
3. "How has it changed over time? Growing, staying same size, fluctuating?"
4. "Did it appear suddenly or gradually?"

**Differential Thinking by Timeline**:

| **Timeline** | **Think Immediately** | **Next Questions** |
|--------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Since birth** | Congenital: Dermoid cyst, haemangioma, branchial cyst, cystic hygroma | "Does it change size with crying?" (vascular lesions increase) |
| **Sudden onset (hours-days)** | Abscess, haematoma, incarcerated hernia, reactive lymph node | "Any trauma?", "Any infection?", "Any pain/redness?" |
| **Rapidly growing (weeks)** | Infection, abscess, aggressive malignancy (lymphoma, sarcoma) | "B symptoms?" (fever, night sweats, weight loss) |
| **Slowly growing (months-years)** | Benign: Lipoma, sebaceous cyst, thyroid nodule<br>Malignancy: Breast cancer, thyroid cancer | "Any risk factors?" (family history, radiation exposure) |
| **Fluctuating size** | Hernia (bigger on straining), vascular lesions, salivary gland swelling (parotid stone) | "What makes it bigger/smaller?" |

**Red Flag Timeline**:
- Doubling in size within **6 weeks** → Consider aggressive malignancy → Urgent referral
- Sudden painful enlargement of previously stable lump → Infection, bleeding into cyst, malignant transformation → Urgent assessment

---

#### M - **MORPHOLOGY** (Size, Shape, Number, Change)

**Key Questions**:
1. "How big is it? Can you describe the size?"
   - Use comparison (e.g., "grape-sized", "golf ball", "hen's egg")
2. "Is it one lump or multiple lumps?"
3. "What shape is it? Round, irregular, flat?"
4. "Has the appearance changed? Any change in color, overlying skin?"

**Differential Thinking by Morphology**:

| **Finding** | **Differential** | **Next Questions** |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Multiple lumps** | Lymphadenopathy (infection, malignancy), lipomatosis, neurofibromatosis, sebaceous cysts | "Any other lumps elsewhere?", "Family history of similar lumps?" |
| **Single lump** | Depends on location (see above) | Focus on characteristics |
| **Very large (>10cm)** | Lipoma, sarcoma, lymphangioma | "Any limitation of movement?", "Any pressure symptoms?" |
| **Small (<1cm)** | Lymph node, sebaceous cyst, skin lesion | "Any recent infection nearby?" |
| **Irregular border** | Malignancy (breast, skin) | "Any skin changes?", "Any nipple discharge?" (breast) |
| **Regular, smooth** | Benign: Lipoma, cyst, fibroma | Reassuring feature |
| **Overlying skin changes** | Infection (erythema), malignancy (peau d'orange in breast), sebaceous cyst (punctum) | "Any discharge?", "Any fever?" |

---

#### P - **PAIN and Associated Symptoms**

**Key Questions**:
1. "Is the lump painful?"
2. "When is it painful? Constant or only when touched?"
3. "Any other symptoms?" (fever, weight loss, night sweats, etc.)

**Differential Thinking by Pain**:

| **Pain Characteristic** | **Think Immediately** | **Likely Diagnosis** |
|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Painless** | Lipoma, sebaceous cyst, thyroid nodule, chronic lymphadenopathy, **malignancy** | **Red flag**: Painless hard lump = cancer until proven otherwise |
| **Painful** | Abscess, infected cyst, inflamed lymph node, incarcerated hernia | Infection or acute inflammation |
| **Tender only on palpation** | Benign breast lump (fibroadenoma), lipoma, reactive lymph node | Usually benign |
| **Pain on straining/coughing** | Hernia (inguinal, femoral) | Hernia highly likely |
| **Throbbing pain** | Abscess, vascular lesion | Infection or vascular origin |

**Associated Symptoms - Red Flags**:

| **Symptom** | **Differential** | **Action** |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **B symptoms** (fever, night sweats, weight loss >5kg in 6 months) | Lymphoma, tuberculosis, metastatic cancer | Urgent referral, FBC, CRP, LDH, CXR |
| **Voice hoarseness** (with neck lump) | Thyroid malignancy with recurrent laryngeal nerve invasion | Urgent ENT/endocrine referral |
| **Dysphagia** (with neck lump) | Large thyroid goitre, retrosternal extension, oesophageal compression | CT neck/chest, urgent referral |
| **Skin changes** (peau d'orange, nipple inversion) | Breast cancer | Urgent referral (2-week wait equivalent) |
| **Bowel obstruction symptoms** (with abdominal hernia) | Incarcerated/strangulated hernia | Emergency surgical assessment |
| **Testicular mass + back pain** | Testicular cancer with retroperitoneal LN mets | Urgent urology referral, tumour markers |

---

### System-Specific History Questions

#### For Neck Lumps:

**Thyroid-Specific Questions**:
- "Any change in voice? Hoarseness?"
- "Any difficulty swallowing or breathing?"
- "Any symptoms of overactive thyroid?" (palpitations, tremor, weight loss, heat intolerance)
- "Any symptoms of underactive thyroid?" (fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation)
- "Any family history of thyroid disease?"
- "Any history of radiation exposure to neck?" (significant risk factor)

**Lymph Node-Specific Questions**:
- "Any recent infections?" (viral URTI, dental infection, skin infection)
- "Any fever, night sweats, unexplained weight loss?"
- "Any persistent cough, difficulty breathing?" (lung cancer with supraclavicular nodes)
- "Any risk factors for HIV, hepatitis?" (if generalized lymphadenopathy)
- "Any recent travel to TB-endemic areas?"

**Salivary Gland Questions** (if pre-auricular or submandibular):
- "Does the lump swell when you eat?"
- "Any dry mouth?"
- "Any facial weakness?" (parotid malignancy affecting facial nerve)

---

#### For Groin Lumps:

**Hernia-Specific Questions**:
- "Does it come down when you cough or strain?"
- "Does it disappear when you lie down? Can you push it back?"
- "Is it painful? Any pain on straining?"
- "Any nausea, vomiting, constipation?" (obstruction)
- "Have you had previous groin surgery or hernia repair?"

**For Males - Scrotal Lump Questions**:
- "Is the lump in the scrotum or above it?"
- "Can you feel the testicle separately from the lump?"
- "Any pain? Any heaviness in scrotum?"
- "Any testicular trauma recently?"
- "Any fertility issues?" (varicocele)

**Vascular Questions** (if considering saphena varix, femoral aneurysm):
- "Does it pulsate?"
- "Does it disappear completely when lying down with leg elevated?"
- "Any leg swelling, varicose veins?"

---

#### For Breast Lumps:

**CRITICAL**: Always consider age and risk factors

**Key Questions**:
1. "When did you first notice the lump?"
2. "Does it change with your menstrual cycle?" (cyclical = likely benign fibrocystic change)
3. "Any nipple discharge? What color?" (bloody = cancer/papilloma, green/brown = duct ectasia)
4. "Any skin changes over the lump or nipple changes?"
5. "Any breast pain?" (mastalgia usually benign but can be cancer)
6. "Are you currently breastfeeding?" (consider mastitis, galactocele)

**Risk Factors for Breast Cancer** (MUST ask):
- Age (>50 = higher risk)
- Family history (BRCA1/2, first-degree relative with breast/ovarian cancer)
- Personal history of breast cancer
- Age at menarche (<12) and menopause (>55) = longer oestrogen exposure
- Nulliparity or first child after 30
- HRT use
- Previous chest radiation
- BRCA1/2 gene mutation

**Red Flags for Breast Cancer**:
- Hard, irregular, fixed lump
- Nipple inversion (new onset)
- Bloody nipple discharge
- Peau d'orange (skin dimpling)
- Axillary lymphadenopathy
- Unilateral symptoms (cancer rarely bilateral)

---

#### For Skin Lumps:

**Malignancy Screening (Melanoma/BCC/SCC)**:

Use **ABCDE for Pigmented Lesions**:
- **A**: "Is it Asymmetrical?"
- **B**: "Are the Borders irregular?"
- **C**: "Are there multiple Colours (black, brown, red, blue)?"
- **D**: "Is the Diameter >6mm?"
- **E**: "Has it Evolved (changed)?"

**Questions**:
1. "Has it changed in size, shape, or color?"
2. "Does it bleed or ooze?"
3. "Does it itch?"
4. "Any sun exposure history? Sunburns as a child?"
5. "Any family history of skin cancer or melanoma?"

**For Sebaceous Cyst**:
- "Is there a central punctum (small hole)?"
- "Does it discharge anything? Smell?" (cheesy keratin)
- "Has it ever been inflamed or infected before?"

---

### Past Medical and Surgical History

**Critical to Ask**:

1. **Previous cancers**: Any history of malignancy increases risk of recurrence/mets
2. **Previous surgeries**:
   - Abdominal surgery → incisional hernia risk
   - Hernia repair → recurrent hernia
   - Thyroidectomy → neck lump could be recurrence
3. **Chronic cough**: Increases intra-abdominal pressure → hernias
4. **Constipation/straining**: Same mechanism
5. **Heavy lifting occupation**: Hernia risk
6. **Immunosuppression**: Increased infection risk, lymphoma risk
7. **Diabetes**: Poor wound healing, increased infection risk

---

### Medications and Allergies

**Why This Matters**:
- **Anticoagulants** (warfarin, DOACs, aspirin): Haematoma risk, bleeding risk for surgery
- **Immunosuppressants** (corticosteroids, biologics): Infection risk, impaired wound healing
- **HRT/OCP**: Breast cancer risk

---

### Social History

**Smoking**:
- Risk factor for malignancy
- Impairs wound healing (if surgery needed)
- Chronic cough → hernia risk

**Alcohol**:
- Heavy use → cirrhosis → umbilical hernia (caput medusae), ascites

**Occupation**:
- Heavy lifting → hernia risk
- Sun exposure → skin cancer risk

**Functional Impact**:
- "How is this lump affecting your daily life?"
- "Any difficulty with movement, work, or activities?"

---

### Family History

**CRITICAL for Malignancy Risk**:
- Breast cancer (especially BRCA1/2)
- Thyroid cancer (familial medullary thyroid cancer in MEN2)
- Colon cancer (associated with thyroid cancer in FAP)
- Melanoma
- Neurofibromatosis (multiple lumps)

---

#### Preparation: The 5 Ps

**P1: PREPARATION**
- Explain: "I'd like to examine the lump. Is that alright?"
- Consent obtained
- Chaperone for intimate examinations (breast, groin, scrotal)
- Wash hands (with patient watching)
- Adequate lighting

**P2: POSITION**

**P4 & P5**: PERFORM and PRESENT (detailed below)

---

### The 7 Ss Examination Framework

#### S1: **SITE** (Anatomical Location)

**What You Do**:
- Identify exact anatomical location
- Describe in relation to landmarks

**Differential Thinking**:

**Neck**:
- **Moves with swallowing** → Thyroid origin (thyroid nodule, goitre)
- **Moves with tongue protrusion** → Thyroglossal cyst (pathognomonic)
- **Anterior triangle, level II-III** → Lymph node
- **Posterior triangle, supraclavicular** → Virchow's node (think gastric/lung cancer)

**Groin**:
- **Above and medial to pubic tubercle** → Inguinal hernia (indirect or direct)
- **Below and lateral to pubic tubercle** → Femoral hernia (higher risk strangulation)
- **Lateral inguinal region** → Lymph nodes (consider infection, STI, malignancy lower limb/pelvis)

**Breast**:
- **Upper outer quadrant** → Most common site for breast cancer
- **Subareolar** → Duct pathology (papilloma, duct ectasia)

**How to Present**:
"There is a 3cm lump located in the right anterior triangle of the neck at level III, which moves with swallowing, consistent with a thyroid nodule."

---

#### S2: **SIZE** (Dimensions)

**What You Do**:
- Measure with ruler/tape measure if available
- Estimate in cm (not "golf ball" in formal presentation)
- Note: Length x Width x Depth

**Differential Thinking**:

| **Size** | **Differential Consideration** |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| **<1cm** | Likely lymph node (benign if soft, mobile) |
| **1-3cm** | Lymph node, sebaceous cyst, lipoma, thyroid nodule |
| **3-5cm** | Larger lipoma, thyroid nodule, breast mass (any breast mass >2cm warrants urgent referral) |
| **>5cm** | Large lipoma, sarcoma, lymphangioma, large hernia |

**Red Flag**: Any breast lump >2cm = urgent referral (BreastScreen Australia guideline)

**How to Present**:
"The lump measures approximately 3cm x 2cm x 2cm."

---

#### S3: **SHAPE** (Morphology and Margins)

**What You Do**:
- Describe shape: Round, oval, irregular, lobulated
- Assess margins: Well-defined vs ill-defined

**Differential Thinking**:

| **Shape/Margin** | **Likely Diagnosis** | **Clinical Significance** |
|------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| **Round/oval, well-defined** | Lipoma, sebaceous cyst, fibroadenoma, benign lymph node | Benign features |
| **Irregular, ill-defined margins** | Malignancy (breast cancer, sarcoma, lymphoma) | **Red flag for cancer** |
| **Lobulated** | Lipoma (multiple lobules), parotid tumor | Often benign but needs investigation |
| **Umbilicated (central depression)** | Sebaceous cyst (central punctum), molluscum contagiosum | Diagnostic feature |
| **Fungating, ulcerated** | Advanced skin cancer (BCC, SCC, melanoma), infected cyst | Urgent referral |

**How to Present**:
"The lump is oval-shaped with well-defined margins and a central punctum, consistent with a sebaceous cyst."

---

#### S4: **SURFACE** (Texture and Overlying Skin)

**What You Do**:
- Inspect overlying skin
- Palpate surface texture

**Differential Thinking**:

| **Surface Finding** | **Differential** | **Next Step** |
|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Smooth** | Lipoma, cyst, lymph node | Benign feature |
| **Irregular, nodular** | Malignancy (breast cancer with skin involvement), necrotic lymph node | Urgent investigation |
| **Erythematous (red)** | Abscess, cellulitis, inflamed cyst, inflammatory breast cancer | Consider infection vs malignancy |
| **Peau d'orange** (dimpling like orange skin) | Breast cancer with dermal lymphatic invasion | **Urgent referral** |
| **Tethered to skin** | Malignancy, chronic infection | Test skin mobility separately |
| **Central punctum** | Sebaceous cyst (pathognomonic) | Diagnostic |
| **Ulcerated** | Skin cancer, infected cyst, tuberculous lymph node | Biopsy needed |
| **Pigmented** | Melanoma, seborrhoeic keratosis, BCC (pigmented variant) | Dermatology referral if ABCDE positive |

**How to Present**:
"The overlying skin is normal with no erythema, ulceration, or tethering. The surface is smooth."

---

#### S5: **SURROUNDING STRUCTURES** (Consistency, Mobility, Fixation)

**What You Do**:
1. **Palpate consistency**: Soft, firm, hard, rubbery
2. **Test mobility**:
   - Move lump in two planes (horizontal and vertical)
   - Test mobility over underlying structures (skin vs muscle vs bone)
3. **Assess fixation**: To skin, muscle, bone

**How to Test Fixation**:
- **Skin**: Try to pinch skin over lump. If can't pinch, tethered to skin.
- **Muscle**: Ask patient to tense muscle (e.g., contract pectoralis for breast lump). If lump becomes less mobile, attached to muscle.
- **Bone**: Try to move lump over bone. If completely immobile, consider bone involvement.

**Differential Thinking by Consistency**:

| **Consistency** | **Think Immediately** | **Likely Diagnosis** |
|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Soft, compressible** | Lipoma (soft, lobulated), lymphangioma | Benign fat/fluid |
| **Firm, rubbery** | Fibroadenoma (breast), reactive lymph node | Benign |
| **Hard, rock-hard** | Malignancy (breast/thyroid/skin cancer), calcified structure | **Red flag for cancer** |
| **Fluctuant** (fluid thrill) | Abscess, cyst (thyroglossal, branchial), bursa | Fluid-filled structure |
| **Doughy** | Lipoma | Benign fat |

**Differential Thinking by Mobility**:

| **Mobility** | **Think Immediately** | **Clinical Significance** |
|--------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Mobile in all directions** | Lipoma, sebaceous cyst, fibroadenoma, benign lymph node | Benign feature |
| **Fixed to skin** | Sebaceous cyst (attached to skin but mobile over deeper structures), skin cancer | Skin origin |
| **Fixed to muscle** | Malignancy invading muscle, desmoid tumor | Concerning for malignancy |
| **Fixed to bone** | Bone involvement (osteosarcoma, metastasis), periosteal lipoma | Needs imaging (X-ray, CT) |
| **Tethered (reduced mobility)** | Malignancy with local invasion | **Red flag** |

**How to Present**:
"The lump is soft and doughy in consistency, freely mobile in all directions, and not attached to skin or underlying structures, consistent with a lipoma."

---

#### S6: **SPECIAL TESTS** (Functional Tests)

**Perform Tests Based on Differential**:

##### For Suspected Hernia:

**1. Cough Impulse Test**:
- Ask patient to cough
- Feel for expansile impulse (lump expands outward with increased intra-abdominal pressure)
- **Positive** = Hernia confirmed

**2. Reducibility Test**:
- Ask patient to lie down
- Gently try to reduce (push lump back into abdomen)
- **Reducible** = Contents can return to abdomen (good prognostic sign)
- **Irreducible** = Contents stuck (adhesions, narrow neck)
- **Tender + Irreducible** = Incarcerated/strangulated → **Surgical emergency**

**3. Distinguish Inguinal vs Femoral Hernia**:
- Palpate pubic tubercle (bony prominence on superior pubic ramus)
- Inguinal hernia: Lump **above and medial** to pubic tubercle
- Femoral hernia: Lump **below and lateral** to pubic tubercle

**4. Distinguish Direct vs Indirect Inguinal Hernia** (advanced):
- Reduce hernia with patient supine
- Place fingers over deep inguinal ring (2cm above midpoint of inguinal ligament)
- Ask patient to stand and cough
- If hernia controlled by finger pressure = **Indirect** (comes through deep ring)
- If hernia not controlled = **Direct** (comes through Hesselbach's triangle, medial to deep ring)

##### For Thyroid Lump:

**1. Swallowing Test**:
- Give patient glass of water
- Ask to swallow
- Watch lump: **Moves upward with swallowing** = Thyroid origin (pathognomonic)

**2. Tongue Protrusion Test**:
- Ask patient to stick tongue out
- **Moves upward with tongue protrusion** = Thyroglossal cyst (pathognomonic - attached to hyoid bone which is connected to tongue via geniohyoid muscle)

##### For Suspected Lymph Node:

**Examine Other Node Groups**:
- Cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, inguinal nodes
- **Generalized lymphadenopathy** → Think systemic: Lymphoma, HIV, infectious mononucleosis, TB

**Associated Findings**:
- Splenomegaly (lymphoma, infectious mono)
- Hepatomegaly (lymphoma, metastatic disease)

##### For Breast Lump:

**1. Skin Tethering Test**:
- Ask patient to raise arms above head
- Look for skin dimpling or tethering (indicates Cooper's ligament involvement by cancer)

**2. Pectoralis Fixation Test**:
- Ask patient to press hands on hips (contracts pectoralis major)
- Try to move lump: If less mobile = **Attached to pectoralis** = Advanced breast cancer with muscle invasion

**3. Nipple Examination**:
- Inspect for inversion (new onset = cancer), eczema (Paget's disease of nipple)
- Gently squeeze to assess for discharge

**4. Axillary Lymph Node Examination**:
- **CRITICAL**: Always examine axilla in any breast lump
- Palpable axillary nodes = possible metastatic spread

##### For Scrotal Lump:

**1. Transillumination Test**:
- Shine torch through lump in darkened room
- **Transilluminates (glows red)** = Fluid-filled (hydrocele, spermatocele)
- **Does not transilluminate** = Solid (testicular tumor, varicocele)

**2. "Can You Get Above It?" Test**:
- Try to palpate superior border of lump
- **Can get above it** = Scrotal lump (hydrocele, testicular mass)
- **Cannot get above it** = Inguinoscrotal hernia (extends into inguinal canal)

**3. Varicocele Test**:
- Palpate with patient standing: Feels like "bag of worms"
- Ask patient to lie down: Varicocele **empties/reduces**
- Perform Valsalva (increase intra-abdominal pressure): Varicocele **increases**

##### For Lipoma:

**Slip Sign**:
- Try to pinch lump between fingers
- Lipoma has tendency to "slip away" from fingers (due to soft, lobulated nature)

##### For Vascular Lesions:

**1. Pulsatility Test**:
- Palpate lump for pulsation
- **Pulsatile + expansile** = Aneurysm (femoral, popliteal) → **Urgent vascular referral**
- **Pulsatile but not expansile** = Transmitted pulsation from adjacent artery (not aneurysm)

**2. Compression Test** (for saphena varix):
- Patient standing: Lump visible in groin
- Patient lies down with leg elevated: Lump **disappears**
- Press over saphenofemoral junction: Lump **does not refill**
- Release pressure and ask patient to cough: Lump **refills** (cough impulse)
- **Diagnosis**: Saphena varix (dilatation of saphenous vein at junction with femoral vein)

---

#### S7: **SOUNDING** (Auscultation)

**What You Do**:
- Use stethoscope to listen over lump

**When and Why**:

| **Finding** | **Diagnosis** | **Significance** |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Bruit (whooshing sound)** | Arteriovenous malformation, vascular tumor (carotid body tumor) | Vascular origin |
| **Bowel sounds** | Inguinal hernia containing bowel | Contents of hernia identified |
| **No sounds** | Most lumps (lipoma, cyst, lymph node) | Expected finding |

**How to Present**:
"On auscultation, there is no bruit heard over the lump."

---

### Regional Examination: Lymph Nodes

**For ANY Lump, Examine Regional Lymph Nodes**:

**Neck lump** → Examine all cervical lymph node chains
**Breast lump** → Examine axillary and supraclavicular nodes
**Skin lesion on arm** → Examine axillary and epitrochlear nodes
**Groin lump** → Examine inguinal nodes bilaterally
**Lower limb skin lesion** → Examine inguinal nodes

**How to Examine Lymph Nodes**:
1. **Inspection**: Visible swelling, skin changes
2. **Palpation**: Size, consistency, tenderness, mobility, matting (stuck together)

**Benign vs Malignant Lymph Node Features**:

| **Feature** | **Benign** | **Malignant** |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Size** | <1cm | >2cm (>1cm supraclavicular) |
| **Consistency** | Soft, rubbery | Hard, rock-hard |
| **Tenderness** | Tender (acute infection) | Non-tender |
| **Mobility** | Mobile | Fixed (matted to surrounding structures) |
| **Number** | Single or few | Multiple, matted together |
| **Associated** | Local infection, recent URTI | Weight loss, night sweats, splenomegaly |

**Red Flags for Malignant Lymphadenopathy**:
- **Supraclavicular node** (Virchow's node on left = gastric cancer)
- Hard, non-tender, fixed
- >2cm and enlarging
- Associated B symptoms
- Splenomegaly

---

## Part 3: Physical Examination of Hernias

### Clinical Anatomy Reminder

**Inguinal Hernia**:
- **Indirect**: Through deep inguinal ring → inguinal canal → may descend into scrotum
  - Lateral to inferior epigastric vessels
  - Covered by all 3 layers of spermatic cord
  - More common in young males
- **Direct**: Through Hesselbach's triangle (weakness in posterior wall)
  - Medial to inferior epigastric vessels
  - Not covered by all cord layers
  - More common in older males, rarely enters scrotum

**Femoral Hernia**:
- Through femoral canal (medial to femoral vein)
- Below and lateral to pubic tubercle
- More common in females
- **Higher risk of strangulation** due to narrow, rigid femoral ring

**Other Hernias**:
- **Umbilical**: Through umbilical ring (children) or paraumbilical (adults)
- **Epigastric**: Through linea alba above umbilicus
- **Incisional**: Through previous surgical incision
- **Spigelian**: Through linea semilunaris (lateral edge of rectus abdominis)

---

### Systematic Hernia Examination

#### Step 1: INSPECTION

**Patient STANDING First** (hernias more obvious when standing):

**Look for**:
1. **Visible bulge** in groin, umbilicus, or previous surgical site
2. **Skin changes**: Erythema (inflammation/infection), bruising (strangulation)
3. **Asymmetry**: Compare both sides

**Ask Patient**:
- "Can you cough for me?" (observe for impulse - bulge appears/enlarges with cough)
- "Can you point to where you feel the lump?"

**Differential Thinking During Inspection**:

| **Observation** | **Think** |
|-----------------|----------|
| Bulge in groin, increases with cough | Inguinal or femoral hernia |
| Bulge at umbilicus | Umbilical or paraumbilical hernia |
| Bulge at old surgical scar | Incisional hernia |
| Scrotal swelling | Inguinoscrotal hernia vs hydrocele |
| Erythematous skin over hernia | Incarceration/strangulation - **surgical emergency** |

#### Step 2: PALPATION (Patient STANDING)

**What You Do**:
1. **Ask permission**: "I'm going to examine the groin area. Is that okay?"
2. **Palpate the lump**:
   - Size, consistency, tenderness
   - **Key question**: "Is it tender?" (Non-tender = reducible, Tender = possible incarceration)

3. **Locate pubic tubercle** (bony prominence on superior pubic ramus):
   - Inguinal hernia: **Above and medial** to pubic tubercle
   - Femoral hernia: **Below and lateral** to pubic tubercle

4. **Cough impulse test**:
   - Place fingers over hernia
   - Ask patient to cough
   - **Positive**: Feel expansile impulse (lump pushes outward)
   - **Confirms diagnosis of hernia**

#### Step 3: REDUCIBILITY (Patient SUPINE)

**Ask patient to lie down**:

**Attempt to reduce hernia**:
1. Apply gentle, steady pressure to push contents back into abdomen
2. **Reducible**: Contents return to abdomen, bulge disappears
   - **Good sign**: Hernia is not incarcerated
3. **Irreducible**: Contents do not return
   - **Differential**: Incarcerated hernia, or chronic hernia with adhesions

**Red Flags - Surgical Emergency**:
- **Irreducible + Tender** = **Incarceration** → Risk of strangulation
- **Irreducible + Tender + Skin changes (erythema/bruising)** = **Strangulation** → **Emergency surgery needed within hours**
- **Associated symptoms**: Nausea, vomiting, obstruction → **Bowel incarceration**

#### Step 4: DISTINGUISH INGUINAL vs FEMORAL

**Critical for Management** (femoral hernias have higher strangulation risk, require urgent surgery):

**Method**:
1. Palpate **pubic tubercle**
2. Determine hernia location **relative to pubic tubercle**:
   - **Inguinal**: Above and medial to pubic tubercle
   - **Femoral**: Below and lateral to pubic tubercle

**If Still Unclear**, use **mid-inguinal point** (midpoint between ASIS and pubic symphysis):
- **Inguinal hernia**: Bulge medial to mid-inguinal point
- **Femoral hernia**: Bulge lateral to mid-inguinal point

#### Step 5: DIRECT vs INDIRECT (Advanced - Not Always Required in OSCE)

**Only if hernia is reducible**:

1. Reduce hernia completely with patient supine
2. Locate **deep inguinal ring**: 2cm above mid-inguinal point (or 1.5cm above femoral pulse)
3. Place two fingers firmly over deep ring
4. Ask patient to stand and cough
5. **Interpretation**:
   - If hernia **controlled** by pressure over deep ring = **Indirect** (emerges through deep ring)
   - If hernia **not controlled** and bulges medial to your fingers = **Direct** (emerges through Hesselbach's triangle)

**Clinical Significance**:
- **Indirect**: More likely to descend into scrotum, more common in younger patients
- **Direct**: Rarely enters scrotum, more common in older patients, lower recurrence after repair

#### Step 6: EXAMINE CONTRALATERAL SIDE

**ALWAYS examine the other side**:
- 10-15% of inguinal hernias are bilateral
- Document: "The contralateral side was examined and no hernia detected"

#### Step 7: SCROTAL EXAMINATION (If Inguinoscrotal Hernia Suspected)

**Key Test: "Can You Get Above It?"**
1. Try to palpate the superior margin of scrotal swelling
2. **Cannot get above it** = **Inguinoscrotal hernia** (swelling extends up into inguinal canal)
3. **Can get above it** = Scrotal pathology (hydrocele, testicular mass, varicocele)

**If Scrotal Pathology**:
- Perform full scrotal examination
- Transillumination test
- Palpate testis separately from lump

---

### Examination of Other Hernias

#### Umbilical/Paraumbilical Hernia

**Inspection**:
- Bulge at umbilicus (children = true umbilical through umbilical ring)
- Bulge adjacent to umbilicus (adults = paraumbilical through linea alba)

**Palpation**:
- Cough impulse positive
- Assess size of defect (palpate edges of fascial defect)

**Reducibility**:
- Usually reducible in supine position
- Irreducible + tender = incarceration → urgent surgical referral

**Red Flag**:
- Hard, irregular, non-reducible umbilical nodule in elderly = **Sister Mary Joseph nodule** (metastatic gastric/ovarian/pancreatic cancer) → Urgent CT abdomen/pelvis

#### Incisional Hernia

**Inspection**:
- Bulge at site of previous surgical incision
- May be very large (especially after midline laparotomy)

**Palpation**:
- Cough impulse positive
- Assess size of defect (can be massive)
- Multiple defects possible ("Swiss cheese" hernia)

**Reducibility**:
- Often reducible but may be chronic and irreducible (adhesions)

**Risk Factors to Ask**:
- Obesity, smoking, diabetes (poor wound healing)
- Wound infection after original surgery
- Chronic cough, heavy lifting

## Part 4: Integrating History and Examination - Clinical Correlation

### Case Example 1: Right Groin Lump

**History**:
- 55-year-old male carpenter
- 6-month history of right groin lump
- Appears when standing/lifting, disappears when lying down
- Mild discomfort on straining
- No nausea/vomiting/obstruction symptoms

**Differential After History**:
1. **Inguinal hernia** (most likely - appears on straining, reducible, occupation with heavy lifting)
2. Femoral hernia (less likely in male, but possible)
3. Lymph node (less likely - would not disappear on lying)
4. Saphena varix (less likely - no varicose veins mentioned)

**Examination Findings**:
- **Inspection (standing)**: 4cm bulge in right groin, increases with cough
- **Palpation**: Soft, non-tender, location **above and medial to pubic tubercle**
- **Cough impulse**: Positive (expansile)
- **Reducibility (supine)**: Fully reducible
- **Deep ring occlusion test**: Hernia controlled when pressure applied over deep ring
- **Contralateral side**: Normal

**Working Diagnosis**: **Right indirect inguinal hernia**

**Next Steps** (in real clinical practice):
- Refer to general surgery for elective repair
- Advise on lifestyle: Avoid heavy lifting, lose weight if obese, treat chronic cough/constipation

---

### Case Example 2: Left Neck Lump

**History**:
- 45-year-old female
- 3-month history of left neck lump
- Noticed while looking in mirror
- No pain, no fever, no night sweats, no weight loss
- No voice change, no difficulty swallowing
- Moves when she swallows

**Differential After History**:
1. **Thyroid nodule** (most likely - moves with swallowing)
2. Thyroglossal cyst (less likely - usually midline, younger patients)
3. Lymph node (less likely - moves with swallowing suggests thyroid)

**Examination Findings**:
- **Inspection**: 2cm lump in left lower anterior neck
- **Palpation**: Firm, smooth, non-tender
- **Site**: Moves upward with swallowing (pathognomonic for thyroid)
- **Does NOT move with tongue protrusion** (rules out thyroglossal cyst)
- **Mobility**: Mobile, not fixed
- **Cervical lymph nodes**: No lymphadenopathy

**Examination of Thyroid**:
- **Inspection**: No goitre, no visible nodule
- **Palpation**: Smooth thyroid gland with 2cm nodule in left lobe
- **No features of hyper/hypothyroidism** on systemic examination

**Working Diagnosis**: **Left thyroid nodule**

**Red Flags to Assess**:
- Hard consistency? (No - firm but not rock-hard)
- Fixed to surrounding structures? (No - mobile)
- Lymphadenopathy? (No)
- Voice change? (No)
- Rapid growth? (No - 3 months, slow)

**Risk Stratification**: **Low risk** (no red flags)

**Next Steps** (in real clinical practice):
- TFTs (check thyroid function)
- Ultrasound thyroid + FNA if suspicious features
- Endocrine surgery referral if FNA shows malignancy or large/symptomatic benign nodule

---

### Case Example 3: Right Breast Lump

**History**:
- 32-year-old female, nulliparous
- 2-week history of right breast lump
- Noticed during self-examination
- Non-tender
- No nipple discharge, no skin changes
- Lump does not change with menstrual cycle
- No family history of breast cancer
- No risk factors

**Differential After History**:
1. **Fibroadenoma** (most likely - young, mobile, non-tender)
2. Breast cancer (less likely - young age, but must exclude)
3. Cyst (possible)

**Examination Findings**:
- **Inspection**: No skin changes, no nipple changes, no asymmetry
- **Palpation**: 2cm lump in upper outer quadrant of right breast
  - Firm, rubbery consistency
  - Smooth, well-defined margins
  - Mobile in all directions
  - Non-tender
- **Skin tethering test**: Negative (no dimpling with arms raised)
- **Pectoralis fixation test**: Negative (mobile when pectoralis contracted)
- **Nipple**: Normal, no discharge
- **Axillary lymph nodes**: No palpable lymphadenopathy
- **Contralateral breast**: Normal

**Working Diagnosis**: **Fibroadenoma** (likely benign)

**But CRITICAL**:
- **ANY breast lump in a woman requires triple assessment** (clinical exam + imaging + biopsy if indicated)
- **Even if clinically benign, must refer for ultrasound ± FNA**

**Next Steps** (in real clinical practice):
- Refer to breast clinic (or GP orders ultrasound)
- Ultrasound ± FNA to confirm benign
- If confirmed fibroadenoma and <3cm, can observe
- If >3cm or patient wishes removal, surgical excision

**Red Flags That Would Change Management to URGENT**:
- Hard consistency, irregular margins, fixed to skin/muscle
- Nipple inversion, bloody discharge, peau d'orange
- Axillary lymphadenopathy
- Age >40 (or >30 with family history)

## Part 8: Common IMG Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### Mistake 1: Not Thinking Differentials from the Start

**What IMGs Do Wrong**:
- Take history mechanically without thinking
- Wait until end to formulate differential

**Correct Approach**:
- **From the moment patient says "lump in neck"**, think: "Thyroid? Lymph node? Cyst? Lipoma?"
- Let differential guide your next questions

**Example**:
- Patient: "Lump in neck"
- **Think immediately**: Thyroid vs lymph node vs other
- **Next question driven by differential**: "Does it move when you swallow?" (thyroid), "Any fever or infections?" (lymph node)

---

### Mistake 2: Not Examining Regional Lymph Nodes

**What IMGs Do Wrong**:
- Examine only the lump, forget lymph nodes

**Correct Approach**:
- **ALWAYS examine regional lymph nodes** for ANY lump
- Neck lump → cervical nodes
- Breast lump → axillary + supraclavicular nodes
- Skin lesion → draining lymph nodes

**Why It Matters**:
- Lymphadenopathy suggests malignancy or infection
- Failure to examine nodes = **fail OSCE**

---

### Mistake 3: Not Assessing Reducibility of Hernia

**What IMGs Do Wrong**:
- Examine hernia with patient standing only
- Forget to ask patient to lie down and test reducibility

**Correct Approach**:
- **ALWAYS test reducibility** (ask patient to lie supine, try to reduce)
- Irreducible + tender = surgical emergency

**OSCE Examiner Expectation**:
- "The candidate did not assess reducibility" = **automatic fail** (missed surgical emergency)

---

### Mistake 4: Not Testing "Moves with Swallowing" for Neck Lump

**What IMGs Do Wrong**:
- Forget to give patient water and test swallowing

**Correct Approach**:
- **For ANY anterior neck lump**, MUST test:
  1. Moves with swallowing? (thyroid)
  2. Moves with tongue protrusion? (thyroglossal cyst)

**Why It Matters**:
- Pathognomonic signs
- Failure to test = fail to diagnose

---

### Mistake 5: Not Examining Contralateral Side

**What IMGs Do Wrong**:
- Examine only the affected side

**Correct Approach**:
- **ALWAYS examine both sides** (hernias, lymph nodes, breast)
- Document: "Contralateral side examined and normal"

---

### Mistake 6: Not Identifying Red Flags

**What IMGs Do Wrong**:
- Describe examination findings but don't recognize red flags

**Correct Approach**:
- **Actively look for and verbalize red flags**:
  - Hard, irregular breast lump = cancer
  - Supraclavicular node = malignancy
  - Irreducible, tender hernia = surgical emergency

**OSCE Presentation**:
- "This is a 3cm hard, irregular lump in the right breast with axillary lymphadenopathy. **Red flags for breast cancer are present**. This requires urgent referral to breast surgery."

---

### Mistake 7: Not Performing Complete Breast Examination

**What IMGs Do Wrong**:
- Palpate lump only, forget to:
  - Examine both breasts
  - Examine axillary lymph nodes
  - Inspect nipple
  - Test skin tethering

**Correct Approach**:
- **Complete breast examination**:
  1. Inspect both breasts (arms by side, arms raised, hands on hips)
  2. Palpate all 4 quadrants + subareolar area of both breasts
  3. Palpate axillary nodes (both sides)
  4. Examine supraclavicular nodes
  5. Test skin tethering (arms raised)
  6. Assess nipple (inversion, discharge)

---

## Part 9: Quick Reference Tables

### Differential Diagnosis by Location

| Anterior midline | Yes | No | Thyroid nodule, goitre |
| Anterior midline | Yes | **Yes** | **Thyroglossal cyst** |
| Anterior triangle | No | No | Lymph node, branchial cyst, submandibular gland |
| Posterior triangle | No | No | Lymph node, cystic hygroma |
| Supraclavicular | No | No | **Virchow's node (malignancy)** |
| Lateral, pulsatile | No | No | Carotid body tumor, carotid aneurysm |

#### Groin Lumps

| **Location** | **Cough Impulse** | **Reducible** | **Differential** |
|--------------|------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Above & medial to pubic tubercle | Yes | Yes | Inguinal hernia |

| Lateral groin | No | No | Lymph node |
| Groin, disappears on lying | Yes (on cough) | Yes | Saphena varix |
| Groin, pulsatile | No | No | Femoral artery aneurysm |

#### Scrotal Lumps

| **Can Get Above It?** | **Transilluminate** | **Other Features** | **Differential** |
|-----------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| No | Variable | Extends into inguinal canal | Inguinoscrotal hernia |
| Yes | **Yes** | Smooth, non-tender | Hydrocele |
| Yes | No | Cannot feel testis separately | **Testicular tumor** |
| Yes | No | "Bag of worms", reduces on lying | Varicocele |
| Yes | **Yes** | Separate from testis, epididymis | Spermatocele/epididymal cyst |

### Red Flags Summary

| **Red Flag** | **Suspected Diagnosis** | **Urgency** |
|--------------|------------------------|------------|
| Irreducible + tender hernia | Incarcerated/strangulated hernia | **Emergency surgery** |
| Hard, irregular breast lump | Breast cancer | Urgent 2-week referral |
| Supraclavicular lymph node | Metastatic malignancy | Urgent 2-week referral |
| Painless testicular lump | Testicular cancer | Urgent urology referral |

## Part 10: Practice Cases for Self-Assessment

### Case 1: Groin Lump in a 65-Year-Old Woman

**Scenario**: 65-year-old woman presents with a painful lump in her right groin that appeared yesterday. She has vomited twice this morning.

**Questions to Consider**:
1. What is your immediate differential?
2. What red flags are present?
3. What examination findings would you look for?
4. What is the likely diagnosis and management?

**Answer**:
1. **Differential**: Femoral hernia (incarcerated/strangulated) vs inguinal hernia vs lymph node (less likely with vomiting)
2. **Red flags**: Acute onset, pain, vomiting (suggests obstruction)
3. **Examination**: Location relative to pubic tubercle (femoral = below and lateral), tenderness, irreducibility, skin changes
4. **Likely diagnosis**: **Incarcerated femoral hernia** → **Emergency surgical referral** (femoral hernias have high strangulation risk)

---

### Case 2: Breast Lump in a 28-Year-Old Woman

**Scenario**: 28-year-old woman, 1cm firm mobile lump in left breast upper outer quadrant, noticed 3 weeks ago, non-tender, no nipple discharge, no family history.

**Questions**:
1. What is the most likely diagnosis?
2. What examination findings would support this?
3. Does she need urgent referral?
4. What is the management plan?

**Answer**:
1. **Most likely**: Fibroadenoma (young age, mobile, rubbery, well-defined)
2. **Examination**: Firm/rubbery, smooth margins, mobile, no skin tethering, no axillary nodes
3. **Urgent referral?** Not emergency, but **ANY breast lump needs triple assessment** → Refer to breast clinic or GP orders ultrasound
4. **Management**: Ultrasound ± FNA → If fibroadenoma confirmed and <3cm, can observe vs excise

---

### Case 3: Neck Lump in a 50-Year-Old Male Smoker

**Scenario**: 50-year-old male, 40 pack-year smoker, presents with a hard 3cm left supraclavicular lymph node, non-tender, 6-week history, 5kg weight loss.

**Questions**:
1. What is the most concerning diagnosis?
2. What is "Virchow's node" and what does it suggest?
3. What other examination findings would you look for?
4. What is the management?

**Answer**:
1. **Most concerning**: Metastatic malignancy (lung, gastric, pancreatic, renal)
2. **Virchow's node**: Left supraclavicular node, drains thoracic duct → Suggests gastric/pancreatic cancer (Troisier's sign)
3. **Other findings**: Examine chest (lung cancer signs), abdomen (hepatomegaly, masses), other lymph node groups (generalized lymphadenopathy)
4. **Management**: **Urgent 2-week referral** to oncology/haematology, CXR, CT chest/abdomen/pelvis, FBC, LDH

---

## Summary: Key Takeaways

### For History-Taking:
1. **Start thinking differentials from the FIRST question** (location gives you differential)
2. **Use LUMP framework** (Location, Understanding timeline, Morphology, Pain/symptoms)
3. **Ask red flag questions** (B symptoms, obstruction, malignancy risk factors)
4. **Tailor questions to location** (thyroid questions for neck, hernia questions for groin, breast cancer risk for breast)

### For Examination:
1. **Use 7 Ss for lumps** (Site, Size, Shape, Surface, Surrounding structures, Special tests, Sounding)
2. **Perform special tests** (swallowing for thyroid, cough impulse for hernia, transillumination for scrotal)
3. **ALWAYS examine regional lymph nodes**
4. **ALWAYS test reducibility for hernias**
5. **ALWAYS examine contralateral side**

### For OSCE Success:
1. **Verbalize your differential thinking** ("This lump moves with swallowing, indicating thyroid origin")
2. **Identify and state red flags** ("Red flags for breast cancer are present")
3. **Systematic approach** (don't skip steps)
4. **Professionalism** (consent, chaperone, patient comfort)
5. **Time management** (practice 8-minute stations)

### For Australian Context:
1. **Know referral pathways** (2-week cancer pathway, emergency vs routine)
2. **Know Medicare coverage** (ultrasound, mammogram, surgical procedures)
3. **Use eTG 2024 guidelines** (thyroid nodule management, skin lesion excision)
