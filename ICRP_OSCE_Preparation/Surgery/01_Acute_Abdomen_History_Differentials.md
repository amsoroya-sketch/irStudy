## INTRODUCTION

### The Differential-Driven Approach (Dr. Amir Soufi Method)

**Traditional approach**: Take complete history → Think about diagnosis at end

**Dr. Amir's approach**: Start thinking differentials FROM THE FIRST QUESTION → Let differential guide your questions → Narrow differential with each answer

**Example**:
- Patient says "right lower quadrant pain"
- **Immediately think**: Appendicitis, ectopic pregnancy (if female), ovarian pathology, inflammatory bowel disease, right ureteric colic
- **Your next questions are driven by differentials**: "Are you pregnant?", "Any fever?", "Any urinary symptoms?"

### Why This Matters for OSCE

**AMC Clinical examiners assess**:
- Can you generate a sensible differential diagnosis?
- Do your questions logically narrow the differential?
- Do you identify red flags?
- Can you formulate a management plan based on differential?

### STEP 1: INTRODUCTION & PRESENTING COMPLAINT (30 seconds)

**Opening**:
"Hello, I'm Dr [Name]. I'm one of the doctors here in the Emergency Department. I understand you've come in with abdominal pain. Is that right?"

**Permission**:
"I'd like to ask you some questions about your pain and your health to work out what might be causing it. Is that okay?"

**Open Question - Let Patient Tell Story**:
"Can you tell me about this abdominal pain - when did it start and what's it been like?"

*[Listen to patient's narrative for 30-60 seconds - don't interrupt]*

---

### STEP 2: HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT (3.5 minutes)

**This is where differential thinking happens**

---

## PAIN CHARACTERISTICS - SOCRATES WITH DIFFERENTIAL THINKING

### **S - SITE**

**Question**: "Where exactly is the pain? Can you point to it with one finger?"

**Differential Thinking by Location**:

#### **Right Upper Quadrant (RUQ) Pain**
**Think immediately**:
1. Cholecystitis / biliary colic
2. Hepatitis
3. Right lower lobe pneumonia
4. Peptic ulcer (duodenal)
5. Retrocaecal appendicitis (can present high)

#### **Epigastric Pain**
**Think immediately**:
1. Peptic ulcer (gastric or duodenal)
2. Gastritis / GORD
3. Pancreatitis
4. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)
5. Myocardial infarction (referred)

#### **Left Upper Quadrant (LUQ) Pain**
**Think immediately**:
1. Splenic pathology (rupture, infarct)
2. Gastric ulcer
3. Pancreatitis (can be LUQ or epigastric)
4. Left lower lobe pneumonia
5. Splenic flexure pathology

#### **Right Lower Quadrant (RLQ) Pain**
**Think immediately**:
1. **Appendicitis** (most common)
2. **Ectopic pregnancy** (if female of childbearing age) - MUST EXCLUDE
3. Ovarian pathology (cyst torsion, rupture)
4. Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's - terminal ileum)
5. Right ureteric colic
6. Meckel's diverticulitis (rare)

#### **Left Lower Quadrant (LLQ) Pain**
**Think immediately**:
1. Diverticulitis
2. Inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis)
3. Ovarian pathology (if female)
4. Left ureteric colic
5. Sigmoid volvulus (elderly)

#### **Central/Periumbilical Pain**
**Think immediately**:
1. **Early appendicitis** (starts central, migrates to RLQ)
2. Small bowel obstruction
3. Early mesenteric ischaemia
4. Abdominal aortic aneurysm
5. Gastroenteritis

#### **Suprapubic Pain**
**Think immediately**:
1. Urinary tract infection / cystitis
2. Urinary retention
3. Pelvic inflammatory disease (if female)
4. Ectopic pregnancy (if female)

#### **Diffuse/Generalized Pain**
**Think immediately**:
1. **Peritonitis** (perforated viscus) - EMERGENCY
2. **Ruptured AAA** - EMERGENCY
3. Bowel obstruction
4. Mesenteric ischaemia
5. Gastroenteritis (usually less severe)

---

### **O - ONSET**

**Question**: "How did the pain start - suddenly or gradually?"

**Differential Thinking**:

**SUDDEN onset (seconds to minutes)**:
- **Perforated viscus** (peptic ulcer, diverticular)
- **Ruptured AAA**
- **Ruptured ectopic pregnancy**
- **Renal colic** (ureteric stone)
- **Ovarian cyst rupture/torsion**
- **Mesenteric ischaemia** (if vascular occlusion)

**Gradual onset (hours)**:
- Appendicitis
- Cholecystitis
- Diverticulitis
- Pancreatitis
- Bowel obstruction

**Question**: "What were you doing when it started?"

**Differential Clues**:
- Started after eating fatty meal → Cholecystitis
- Started during/after heavy lifting → Incarcerated hernia
- Started after trauma → Splenic rupture, solid organ injury

---

### **C - CHARACTER**

**Question**: "Can you describe what the pain feels like?"

**Differential Thinking**:

**Colicky (comes in waves, cramping)**:
- **Ureteric colic** (renal stone) - "worst pain of my life", comes in waves
- **Bowel obstruction** - crampy, intermittent
- **Biliary colic** (early, before cholecystitis)

**Constant, Sharp**:
- **Peritonitis** - sharp, constant, worse with movement
- **Appendicitis** (once established)
- **Diverticulitis**

**Constant, Dull/Aching**:
- **Cholecystitis**
- **Pancreatitis** (boring, deep)
- **AAA** (deep, constant)

**Burning**:
- **Peptic ulcer**
- **GORD**

---

### **R - RADIATION**

**Question**: "Does the pain spread anywhere else?"

**Differential Thinking**:

**RUQ → Right shoulder/scapula**:
- **Cholecystitis** (referred via phrenic nerve)

**Epigastric → Back**:
- **Pancreatitis** (classic - "boring through to back")
- **Peptic ulcer** (posterior wall perforation)
- **AAA**

**Loin → Groin**:
- **Ureteric colic** (renal stone)

**No radiation**:
- More likely localized pathology (appendicitis, diverticulitis)

---

### **A - ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS**

**This is CRITICAL for differential diagnosis**

**Ask systematically**:

**Gastrointestinal**:
- "Any nausea or vomiting?"
  - Vomiting BEFORE pain → Gastroenteritis
  - Pain BEFORE vomiting → Surgical abdomen (appendicitis, cholecystitis, obstruction)

- "Any change in bowel habit - diarrhea or constipation?"
  - Diarrhea → Gastroenteritis, IBD
  - Constipation + no flatus → Bowel obstruction

- "Any blood in vomit or stool?"
  - Haematemesis → Peptic ulcer, gastritis
  - PR bleeding → IBD, diverticulitis, ischaemic colitis

**Urinary**:
- "Any urinary symptoms - burning, frequency, blood in urine?"
  - Dysuria + frequency → UTI
  - Haematuria → Renal stone, UTI

**Gynecological (if female)**:
- "When was your last menstrual period?"
  - Late period + abdominal pain → **ECTOPIC PREGNANCY** until proven otherwise

- "Any vaginal bleeding or discharge?"
  - Bleeding + pain → Ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, PID

- "Is there any chance you could be pregnant?"
  - **MUST ASK every female of childbearing age (12-55)**

**Constitutional**:
- "Any fever or chills?"
  - Fever → Infection (appendicitis, cholecystitis, diverticulitis, PID)

- "Any weight loss?"
  - Unintentional weight loss → Malignancy, IBD

**Cardiovascular**:
- "Any chest pain or shortness of breath?"
  - May indicate MI (referred to epigastrium), pneumonia (referred to upper abdomen)

---

### **T - TIME COURSE / TIMING**

**Questions**:
- "How long have you had this pain?"
- "Has it been constant or does it come and go?"
- "Is it getting better, worse, or staying the same?"

**Differential Thinking**:

**Hours (hyperacute)**:
- Appendicitis (typically <24 hours at presentation)
- Cholecystitis
- Renal colic
- Perforated viscus

**Days**:
- Diverticulitis
- Pancreatitis

**Weeks-Months (chronic, now acute)**:
- IBD flare
- Malignancy (with acute complication)

**Pattern**:
- **Constant and worsening** → Appendicitis, peritonitis, ischaemia
- **Comes and goes** → Biliary colic, renal colic, bowel obstruction

---

### **E - EXACERBATING/RELIEVING FACTORS**

**Questions**:
- "Is there anything that makes the pain worse?"
- "Is there anything that makes it better?"

**Differential Thinking**:

**Worse with movement/coughing** → **Peritonitis** (patient lies still)

**Worse with eating** → Peptic ulcer, cholecystitis, pancreatitis

**Better with eating** → Duodenal ulcer (classic - pain 2-3 hours after eating, relieved by food)

**Better with leaning forward** → Pancreatitis

**Better after vomiting** → Gastritis, GORD

**Worse with urination** → UTI

**Can't find comfortable position** → Renal colic (patient writhes in pain, contrasts with peritonitis where patient lies still)

---

### **S - SEVERITY**

**Question**: "On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable, how would you rate your pain?"

**Also ask**: "Is this the worst pain you've ever had?"

**Differential Thinking**:

**10/10 "worst pain of my life"**:
- **Ruptured AAA**
- **Perforated viscus**
- **Renal colic**
- **Ruptured ectopic**

**7-9/10 severe**:
- Appendicitis
- Cholecystitis
- Pancreatitis

**4-6/10 moderate**:
- Gastroenteritis
- UTI
- Constipation

## RED FLAGS - DON'T MISS DIAGNOSES

### The SURGICAL EMERGENCIES (Recognize Immediately)

**1. RUPTURED AAA**
- Triad: Abdominal/back pain + Pulsatile mass + Hypotension
- **→ Activate massive transfusion → OR**

**2. RUPTURED ECTOPIC PREGNANCY**
- Triad: Abdominal pain + Amenorrhoea + Shock
- **→ βHCG + USS → Urgent gynae consult**

**3. PERFORATED VISCUS**
- Sudden severe pain → Board-like rigidity → Peritonitis
- **→ Erect CXR → Urgent surgical consult**

**4. MESENTERIC ISCHAEMIA**
- Pain out of proportion to examination + AF + Bloody diarrhoea
- **→ ↑Lactate + CT angiogram → Urgent vascular surgery**

**5. ACUTE APPENDICITIS WITH PERFORATION**
- Peritonitis, sepsis
- **→ Urgent surgical consult**

### Red Flag Features

**Vital Signs**:
- Hypotension (SBP <90)
- Tachycardia (HR >120)
- Fever >38.5°C (sepsis)
- Tachypnea (peritonitis, sepsis)

**Pain**:
- Sudden onset severe pain
- Pain migrating to generalized
- "Worst pain of my life"

**Examination** (you won't do this in history station, but know it):
- Rigidity, rebound tenderness (peritonitis)
- Pulsatile mass (AAA)
- Absent bowel sounds (ileus, peritonitis)

**History**:
- Age >65 + vascular disease (AAA risk)
- Female + amenorrhoea + pain (ectopic)
- Recent surgery (bowel obstruction from adhesions)
- AF + abdominal pain (mesenteric ischaemia)

---

## SYSTEMATIC REVIEW FOR ACUTE ABDOMEN

**After SOCRATES and associated symptoms, quickly screen systems**:

**Cardiovascular**: "Any chest pain, palpitations, or leg swelling?"
- MI, DVT/PE

**Respiratory**: "Any cough, shortness of breath?"
- Pneumonia (referred pain to upper abdomen)

**Remaining GI**: "Any difficulty swallowing, heartburn, change in appetite?"

**Genitourinary**: *Already covered* (urinary symptoms, LMP)

**Constitutional**: "Any night sweats, unintentional weight loss, fatigue?"
- Malignancy

---

## CLINICAL REASONING - NARROWING THE DIFFERENTIAL

### The Mental Process (Dr. Amir's Approach)

**STEP 1: Location gives you starting differential (5-7 possibilities)**

**STEP 2: Onset narrows it**
- Sudden → Perforation, rupture, torsion, stone
- Gradual → Inflammatory (appendicitis, cholecystitis, diverticulitis)

**STEP 3: Character helps**
- Colicky → Stone, obstruction
- Constant sharp → Peritonitis, appendicitis
- Burning → Ulcer

**STEP 4: Associated symptoms NARROW SIGNIFICANTLY**
- Fever → Infection (appendicitis, cholecystitis, diverticulitis, PID)
- Vomiting before pain → Gastroenteritis (medical)
- Pain before vomiting → Surgical
- Haematuria → Stone
- Missed period → Ectopic
- Bloody stool → IBD, diverticulitis, ischaemia

**STEP 5: Red flags identify EMERGENCIES**

### Example Clinical Reasoning

**Case**: 25F, RLQ pain, missed period by 1 week, vaginal spotting, shoulder tip pain

**Step 1 (Location - RLQ)**: Appendicitis, ectopic, ovarian, renal stone, IBD

**Step 2 (Onset - sudden)**: Favors ectopic rupture, ovarian torsion, stone over appendicitis

**Step 3 (Character - sharp)**: Consistent with rupture or torsion

**Step 4 (Associated - missed period, vaginal bleeding)**: **ECTOPIC PREGNANCY** moves to top

**Step 5 (Red flag - shoulder tip pain)**: Haemoperitoneum → **RUPTURED ECTOPIC** → EMERGENCY

**Your differential in presentation**:
1. **Ruptured ectopic pregnancy** (most likely, EMERGENCY)
2. Ovarian cyst rupture/torsion
3. Appendicitis (less likely given sudden onset and gynae symptoms)

**Your next steps**: βHCG, urgent USS, gynae consult

---

## INVESTIGATION PLANNING

### Based on Differential

**General Bloods for Most Acute Abdomen**:
- FBC (WCC for infection)
- CRP (inflammation)
- U&E (dehydration, renal function before contrast)
- LFTs (if RUQ pain or jaundice)
- Lipase (if epigastric pain - pancreatitis)
- Lactate (if concerned about ischaemia)
- Blood cultures (if septic)

**Specific Investigations by Differential**:

| Differential | Investigation | What You're Looking For |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| Appendicitis | Clinical diagnosis<br>CT abdomen if unclear | Dilated appendix >6mm, periappendiceal fat stranding |
| Cholecystitis | USS abdomen | Gallstones, thick GB wall (>4mm), pericholecystic fluid, sonographic Murphy's sign |
| Pancreatitis | Lipase (>3x ULN)<br>CT after 48-72hr | Lipase ↑↑↑<br>CT: Pancreatic inflammation, necrosis |
| Perforated viscus | Erect CXR<br>CT abdomen | Free air under diaphragm<br>Pneumoperitoneum |
| Bowel obstruction | AXR<br>CT abdomen | Dilated loops, air-fluid levels<br>Transition point |
| AAA | CT angiogram (if stable)<br>Bedside USS (if unstable) | Aneurysm >3cm, rupture |
| Ectopic pregnancy | βHCG<br>Transvaginal USS | +ve βHCG, no intrauterine pregnancy, adnexal mass, free fluid |
| Renal stone | Urinalysis<br>CT KUB (non-contrast) | Haematuria<br>Stone location, size, hydronephrosis |
| Diverticulitis | CT abdomen with IV contrast | Sigmoid wall thickening, pericolic fat stranding, abscess |

## COMMON IMG MISTAKES

### Mistake 1: Not Thinking Differential from Start
❌ Taking complete unfocused history → Thinking about diagnosis at end
✅ Think differential from location → Let differential guide your questions

### Mistake 2: Not Excluding Ectopic Pregnancy
❌ Forgetting to ask LMP in female with abdominal pain
✅ **ALWAYS ask LMP in females 12-55 years old**

### Mistake 3: Not Identifying Red Flags
❌ Focusing only on common diagnoses (appendicitis, gastroenteritis)
✅ Actively screen for emergencies (ruptured AAA, perforated viscus, ruptured ectopic)

### Mistake 4: Not Using SOCRATES Systematically
❌ Jumping around, missing key features
✅ Methodical SOCRATES every time

### Mistake 5: Not Summarizing with Differential
❌ Ending history without differential diagnosis
✅ "Based on this history, my main differential diagnoses are..."
