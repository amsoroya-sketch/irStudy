## Understanding the Problem

### Why History Taking is Critical for ICRP
- **Primary Clinical Skill:** You'll take 5-10+ histories daily during ICRP
- **Supervisor Assessment:** Your supervisor will directly observe your history-taking
- **Diagnosis Foundation:** 80% of diagnoses come from history alone
- **Patient Rapport:** Good history-taking builds trust and demonstrates communication skills
- **Australian Context:** Must adapt to Australian communication style and health system

### Common Weakness Patterns
- ☐ Unstructured approach - jumping around topics randomly
- ☐ Missing critical information - no systematic checklist
- ☐ Too slow - taking 15-20 minutes for basic history
- ☐ Poor opening - awkward introductions
- ☐ Interrupted flow - forgetting what to ask next
- ☐ Missing social/functional history - not asking about impact on life
- ☐ No red flags - missing danger signs
- ☐ Poor closing - no summary or patient questions

## 8-Minute History Structure (DETAILED)

### 1. INTRODUCTION (30 seconds)
**Purpose:** Build rapport, establish professional relationship, gain consent

**Script Template:**
```
"Good morning/afternoon. My name is [Your Name], and I'm a Medical Support Officer
working with Dr. [Supervisor's Name].

How would you like me to address you? [Listen for response]

Thank you, [Patient Name]. I understand you're here today because [reason].
I'd like to ask you some questions about your health to help us understand what's
going on. This will take about 10-15 minutes. Is that okay with you?

[Wait for consent]

Great, thank you."
```

**Key Elements:**
- ✓ State your name and role clearly
- ✓ Ask patient's preferred name
- ✓ Explain purpose
- ✓ State time needed
- ✓ Get consent
- ✓ Warm, professional tone

**Australian Communication Style:**
- Friendly but professional
- Direct but respectful
- Use "please" and "thank you"
- Eye contact important
- Avoid excessive formality

---

### 2. PRESENTING COMPLAINT (30 seconds)
**Purpose:** Identify the main problem in patient's own words

**Questions:**
```
"What brings you in today?"
OR
"What's been troubling you?"
```

**What to Record:**
- Chief complaint in patient's exact words
- Duration: "I've had chest pain for 3 days"
- Single sentence summary

**Example:**
- Patient: "I've been having this terrible headache for the past week"
- Record: "Headache x 1 week"

---

### 3. HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT (HPC) - 3-4 minutes
**Purpose:** Get complete details about the main problem

#### Use SOCRATES for PAIN/SYMPTOM Analysis

**S - Site**
- "Where exactly is the [pain/symptom]?"
- "Can you point to it?"

**O - Onset**
- "When did it start?"
- "What were you doing when it started?"
- "Did it come on suddenly or gradually?"

**C - Character**
- "Can you describe what it feels like?"
- Pain descriptors: Sharp, dull, aching, burning, crushing, stabbing, throbbing

**R - Radiation**
- "Does it spread anywhere?"
- "Do you feel it anywhere else?"

**A - Associated Symptoms**
- "Have you noticed anything else happening at the same time?"
- System-specific questions (see below)

**T - Time Course/Pattern**
- "Is it constant or does it come and go?"
- "When is it worse? When is it better?"
- "How long does it last?"

**E - Exacerbating/Relieving Factors**
- "What makes it worse?"
- "What makes it better?"
- "Have you tried anything for it?"

**S - Severity**
- "On a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the worst pain imaginable, how bad is it?"
- "How is it affecting your daily life?"

#### System-Specific Questions

**Cardiovascular (Chest Pain)**
- Shortness of breath? Palpitations?
- Sweating? Nausea?
- Previous heart problems?
- Risk factors: Smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, family history?

**Respiratory (Shortness of Breath)**
- Cough? Sputum (color)?
- Wheeze? Chest pain?
- Fever? Night sweats?
- Smoking history (pack-years)?

**Gastrointestinal (Abdominal Pain)**
- Nausea? Vomiting? What does it look like?
- Bowel movements? Diarrhea? Constipation? Blood in stool?
- Last bowel movement?
- Appetite? Weight change?
- Urinary symptoms?

**Neurological (Headache)**
- Visual changes? Photophobia?
- Nausea/vomiting?
- Neck stiffness? Fever?
- Weakness? Numbness?
- Similar headaches before?
- Trauma?

**RED FLAGS - Always Ask:**
- Fever/chills/night sweats
- Unexplained weight loss
- Blood (anywhere - vomit, stool, urine, cough)
- Severe pain
- Sudden onset
- Progressive worsening

---

### 4. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY (PMH) - 1 minute

**Structured Approach:**
```
"Tell me about your general health. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions?"

If patient doesn't recall, prompt with common conditions:
"Have you ever been told you have:
- Diabetes?
- High blood pressure?
- Heart problems?
- Asthma or lung problems?
- Thyroid problems?
- Cancer?"

"Have you had any surgeries or procedures?"
"Have you been hospitalized before?"
```

**Record Format:**
- DM Type 2 diagnosed 2018
- Hypertension x 10 years
- Appendectomy 2015
- No other significant PMHx

---

### 5. MEDICATIONS & ALLERGIES - 30 seconds

**Medications:**
```
"What medications are you currently taking?"
"Any over-the-counter medications or supplements?"
"Any inhalers? Insulin?"
```

**Record:** Medication name, dose, frequency
- Example: Metformin 500mg BD (twice daily)
- Example: Salbutamol inhaler PRN (as needed)

**Important for Australia:**
- Use Australian drug names (Panadol not Tylenol)
- Ask about PBS (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) medications

**Allergies:**
```
"Do you have any allergies to medications?"
"What happens when you take [medication]?"
```

**Record:** Drug and specific reaction
- Example: Penicillin → rash
- NOT an allergy: "statins upset my stomach" (side effect, not allergy)

---

### 6. FAMILY HISTORY (FMHx) - 30 seconds

```
"Does anyone in your immediate family have any significant health conditions?
- Parents?
- Siblings?
- Children?"

Specific prompts for relevant conditions:
- Heart disease?
- Diabetes?
- Cancer? What type?
- Stroke?
```

**Record Format:**
- Father: MI age 55, deceased
- Mother: Hypertension, alive and well age 78
- No siblings
- 2 children healthy

---

### 7. SOCIAL HISTORY (SHx) - 1 minute
**Critical for Australian Context**

#### Occupational History
```
"What do you do for work?"
"Are you currently working?"
"Does your condition affect your work?"
```

#### Smoking
```
"Do you smoke?"
If yes: "How many per day? For how many years?"
Calculate pack-years: (cigarettes per day ÷ 20) × years
If former: "When did you quit?"
```

#### Alcohol
```
"Do you drink alcohol?"
If yes: "How much in a typical week?"
```

**Australian Standard Drinks:**
- 1 standard drink = 10g alcohol
- Record in standard drinks per week
- Safe limits: <10/week for most adults

#### Recreational Drugs
```
"Do you use any recreational substances?"
```
- Non-judgmental tone
- Important for medical care

#### Living Situation
```
"Who do you live with?"
"What type of housing? (house, apartment, stairs?)"
"Do you have support at home?"
```

#### Functional Impact
```
"How is this problem affecting your daily activities?"
"Can you still work? Drive? Care for yourself?"
```

**Australian Specific:**
- Ask about Medicare card
- Private health insurance?
- Centrelink (if relevant for disability/unemployment)
- NDIS (National Disability Insurance Scheme) if applicable

---

### 8. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS (ROS) - 1 minute
**Quick screen for missed symptoms**

```
"Just to make sure we haven't missed anything, I'm going to ask about other
systems in your body."

GENERAL: Fever? Weight change? Fatigue? Night sweats?

CARDIOVASCULAR: Chest pain? Palpitations? Leg swelling?

RESPIRATORY: Cough? Shortness of breath? Wheeze?

GASTROINTESTINAL: Abdominal pain? Nausea? Vomiting? Bowel changes?

GENITOURINARY: Urinary frequency? Pain? Blood?

NEUROLOGICAL: Headaches? Dizziness? Weakness? Numbness?

MUSCULOSKELETAL: Joint pain? Muscle pain? Stiffness?

SKIN: Rashes? Lumps?
```

**Tip:** Only ask about systems not already covered in HPC

---

### 9. SUMMARIZE & CLOSE - 30 seconds

```
"Thank you [Patient Name]. Let me make sure I understand correctly:

You're a [age]-year-old [occupation] who came in today with [presenting complaint]
that started [duration]. The [symptoms] are [character], and you've also noticed
[associated symptoms]. You have a history of [PMHx], taking [medications], and
this is affecting your [functional impact].

Is there anything I've missed or that you'd like to add?"

"Do you have any questions for me at this point?"

"Thank you so much for your time. [Supervisor/Doctor] will examine you and
discuss the next steps."
```

**Why Summary Matters:**
- ✓ Confirms understanding
- ✓ Catches missed information
- ✓ Shows professionalism
- ✓ Gives patient chance to add details
- ✓ Demonstrates active listening

---

## Common Mistakes & How to Fix Them

### Mistake #1: Unstructured/Random Questioning
**Problem:** Jumping from topic to topic, forgetting sections

**Solution:**
- Memorize the 9-step structure
- Use mental checklist
- Practice in same order every time
- Write down structure on paper during practice
- After 50 practices, it becomes automatic

**Daily Practice:**
- Morning: Recite the 9 steps before breakfast (2 min)
- Practice: Follow structure religiously for every practice history
- Review: Check which sections you missed after each practice

---

### Mistake #2: Taking Too Long (15-20 minutes)
**Problem:** Too detailed, going down rabbit holes, not time-aware

**Solution:**
- **Use a timer:** Set 8-minute alarm for every practice
- **Prioritize:** Spend most time on HPC (the main problem)
- **Be focused:** Ask relevant questions only
- **Avoid tangents:** Politely redirect: "We'll come back to that"
- **Practice speed:** Aim for 6 minutes, then have 2-minute buffer

**Time Management Tips:**
- Wear a watch/visible timer
- Mental checkpoint at 4 minutes (should be finishing HPC)
- If running over, condense ROS
- Never skip: Introduction, HPC, Social History

**Daily Practice:**
- Week 1-2: Don't time (focus on structure)
- Week 3-4: 12-minute target
- Week 5-8: 10-minute target
- Week 9-12: 8-minute target
- Month 3: Consistently under 8 minutes

---

### Mistake #3: Missing Red Flags
**Problem:** Not asking about dangerous symptoms

**Solution: Create a Red Flag Checklist**

**MUST ASK for Every Presenting Complaint:**
- ☐ Fever/chills
- ☐ Weight loss (unintentional)
- ☐ Night sweats
- ☐ Bleeding (any source)
- ☐ Severe pain (>8/10)
- ☐ Sudden onset
- ☐ Progressive worsening
- ☐ Trauma/injury

**System-Specific Red Flags:**

**Chest Pain RED FLAGS:**
- ☐ Crushing/pressure sensation
- ☐ Radiation to jaw/arm
- ☐ Sweating
- ☐ Shortness of breath
- ☐ Nausea/vomiting
→ Think: MI, PE

**Headache RED FLAGS:**
- ☐ Sudden, severe ("thunderclap")
- ☐ Fever + neck stiffness
- ☐ Visual changes
- ☐ Confusion/altered consciousness
- ☐ Worse with coughing/bending
→ Think: Meningitis, SAH, space-occupying lesion

**Abdominal Pain RED FLAGS:**
- ☐ Severe, constant
- ☐ Vomiting blood/coffee ground
- ☐ Blood in stool (red or black/tarry)
- ☐ Rebound tenderness
- ☐ Not passing stool/gas
→ Think: Acute abdomen, perforation, bowel obstruction

**Memorization Technique:**
- Write red flags on flashcards
- Review before every practice session
- After taking history, ask: "Did I check for red flags?"

---

### Mistake #4: Poor Opening/Introduction
**Problem:** Awkward start, unclear role, no rapport

**Solution: Script and Practice**

**Create Your Personal Introduction Script:**
```
"Good morning, I'm [Your Name]. I'm a Medical Support Officer working with
the team here at Young Hospital.

How would you like me to address you? [Listen]

Thank you, [Name]. I'd like to ask you some questions about your health today
to help understand what's been going on. This will take about 10 minutes.
Is that alright?

[Smile, make eye contact, wait for agreement]

Great, thank you. So, what brings you in today?"
```

**Practice Daily:**
- Practice introduction 10 times in front of mirror
- Record yourself on phone - watch for:
  - Body language (open, friendly)
  - Eye contact (warm, not intimidating)
  - Tone (professional but warm)
  - Pace (not too fast)
- Practice with family member until smooth
- Goal: Introduction feels natural, not scripted

---

### Mistake #5: Forgetting Social/Functional History
**Problem:** Only focusing on medical facts, missing impact on life

**Solution: Make it a Mandatory Section**

**Create "IMPACT" Mnemonic:**
- **I**ndependence: Can they care for themselves?
- **M**obility: Can they walk, drive, move around?
- **P**ain impact: How does it affect daily life?
- **A**ctivities: What can't they do now?
- **C**areers: Impact on work?
- **T**reatment expectations: What are they hoping for?

**Questions to Always Ask:**
```
"How is this affecting your daily life?"
"Can you still work?"
"Do you need help with daily activities?"
"What are you most worried about?"
```

**Australian Context Questions:**
```
"Are you on any Centrelink benefits?"
"Do you have a Medicare card?"
"Do you have private health insurance?"
"Do you have support at home?"
```

---

### Mistake #6: Not Documenting While Taking History
**Problem:** Forgetting details, having to ask again, looking disorganized

**Solution: Learn to Write While Listening**

**Two-Column Note Method:**

```
LEFT COLUMN: Keywords/Phrases       RIGHT COLUMN: Details
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PC: Chest pain                       "heavy pressure"
Onset: 3 days ago                    After climbing stairs
Character: Crushing                  "like elephant on chest"
Radiation: Left arm                  To jaw
Associated: SOB, sweating            Nausea
Duration: 10-20 min episodes
Relieved: Rest
PMHx: HTN, T2DM
Meds: Metformin 500mg BD            Perindopril 5mg daily
```

**Practice This Skill:**
- Week 1-2: Just listen, write after
- Week 3-4: Write keywords while listening
- Week 5+: Write full notes while maintaining eye contact

**Tips:**
- Use abbreviations (see list below)
- Look at patient 70% of time, write 30%
- Nod while writing to show listening
- Develop your shorthand system

---
