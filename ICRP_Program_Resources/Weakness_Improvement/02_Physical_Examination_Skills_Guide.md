## Why Physical Examination Matters

### Critical for ICRP Success
- **Daily Requirement:** You'll examine 5-15 patients daily
- **Supervisor Observation:** Direct assessment of your examination technique
- **Clinical Competence:** Physical exam findings guide diagnosis and management
- **Professional Image:** Smooth, systematic exam = competent doctor
- **Patient Confidence:** Thorough exam builds trust

### Common Consequences of Weak Examination Skills
- ❌ Missed clinical findings
- ❌ Supervisor concern about competence
- ❌ Takes too long (15-20 min when should be 5-10 min)
- ❌ Looks disorganized and unprofessional
- ❌ Patient discomfort from rough/uncertain technique
- ❌ Lack of confidence shows

---

## Common Problems & Solutions

### Problem #1: No Systematic Approach
**Symptoms:**
- Jumping around randomly
- Forgetting steps
- Having to re-examine

**Solution:**
- **Learn ONE systematic sequence for each examination**
- **Practice the SAME sequence EVERY time**
- **Never vary the order** - muscle memory is key

**Practice Method:**
- Write out the sequence
- Perform examination while reading sequence
- Perform examination while reciting sequence
- Perform examination from memory
- After 20 practices: Automatic

---

### Problem #2: Rough/Uncomfortable Technique
**Symptoms:**
- Patient winces or pulls away
- Heavy-handed palpation
- Not warming hands/stethoscope
- Abrupt movements

**Solution:**
**The 3 W's:**
- **Warm:** Warm your hands and stethoscope
- **Watch:** Watch patient's face for pain/discomfort
- **Warn:** "I'm going to press on your tummy now"

**Practice Method:**
- Practice on yourself first
- Practice on family members - ask for feedback
- Start gentle, gradually increase pressure
- Always ask: "Does this hurt?"

---

### Problem #3: Too Slow
**Symptoms:**
- Taking 15-20 minutes per examination
- Repeating steps
- Uncertain about what to do next

**Solution:**
- **Timed practice** - use stopwatch
- **Focused examination** - examine relevant systems
- **Efficiency** - smooth transitions between steps
- **Practice** - speed comes with repetition

**Time Targets:**
- Cardiovascular: 8-10 minutes
- Respiratory: 6-8 minutes
- Abdominal: 8-10 minutes
- Neurological: 15-20 minutes (acceptable)
- Focused MSK: 5-10 minutes per joint

---

### Problem #4: Missing Findings
**Symptoms:**
- Supervisor finds things you missed
- Not examining thoroughly
- Rushing through steps

**Solution:**
- **Systematic approach prevents misses**
- **Never skip steps** - even if they seem normal
- **Look, Listen, Feel** - use all senses
- **Compare sides** - always compare left and right
- **Specific technique** - learn proper palpation, percussion, auscultation

## Universal Examination Principles

### The 5 Ps of Every Examination

#### 1. PREPARATION
```
☐ Wash hands (or use sanitizer)
☐ Introduce yourself
☐ Confirm patient identity
☐ Explain what you'll do
☐ Get consent
☐ Ensure privacy (curtains/door)
☐ Ensure adequate lighting
☐ Position patient correctly
☐ Expose area adequately (with dignity)
☐ Warm hands and equipment
```

**Script:**
```
"Hello, I'm [Name], Medical Support Officer. I'd like to examine your [system].
This will involve me looking, listening with my stethoscope, and gently pressing
on your [area]. It will take about 10 minutes. Is that okay?

Please could you [position instructions]?
I'll give you privacy to [adjust clothing].
Let me know if you feel any discomfort."
```

---

#### 2. POSITION
**Correct positioning is crucial!**

| Examination | Patient Position | Bed Angle |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Cardiovascular | Semi-recumbent | 45 degrees |
| Respiratory | Sitting up/45 degrees | 45-90 degrees |
| Abdominal | Flat, arms by side | 0 degrees (flat) |
| Neurological | Varies by test | Usually sitting |
| Thyroid | Sitting up | 90 degrees |

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ Examining cardiovascular with patient flat (miss JVP)
- ❌ Examining abdomen with patient sitting (tense abdomen)
- ❌ Wrong bed height (examiner uncomfortable)

---

#### 3. PERMISSION
**Before EVERY step:**
```
"I'm going to listen to your heart now, is that okay?"
"I'm going to press on your tummy, please tell me if it hurts"
"I'm going to check your pulses, this okay?"
```

**Australian Communication Style:**
- Friendly but professional
- Explain as you go
- Check comfort regularly
- "Is this okay?" not "Okay?"

---

#### 4. PERFORM
**The 4-Step Examination Sequence:**

**1. INSPECTION (Look)**
- General appearance
- Specific signs
- Asymmetry
- Color changes

**2. PALPATION (Feel)**
- Temperature
- Texture
- Lumps/masses
- Tenderness
- Pulses

**3. PERCUSSION (Tap)**
- Resonance (lungs)
- Dullness (fluid, solid organs)
- Compare sides

**4. AUSCULTATION (Listen)**
- Heart sounds
- Breath sounds
- Bowel sounds
- Always use stethoscope properly

---

#### 5. PRESENT
**After examination:**
```
"Thank you [Name]. You can get dressed now/adjust your clothing.
I'll discuss the findings with [Supervisor]."
```

**Then present findings to supervisor:**
- Systematic presentation
- Positive findings
- Relevant negative findings
- Your interpretation (if confident)

---

## CARDIOVASCULAR EXAMINATION

### Complete Systematic Approach

#### PART 1: Introduction & Exposure (1 minute)
```
"Hello, I'm [Name]. I'd like to examine your heart and circulation.
This involves looking, feeling for your pulse, and listening with my
stethoscope. Is that alright?

Please could you remove your shirt/top and lie back at about 45 degrees?
I'll give you privacy."
```

**Positioning:**
- 45-degree angle
- Chest exposed (men: fully; women: preserve dignity with draping)
- Arms by side, relaxed

---

#### PART 2: General Inspection (30 seconds)

**From End of Bed:**
☐ **General appearance:** Comfortable at rest? Breathless? Distressed?
☐ **Obvious devices:** Oxygen, monitors, IV lines
☐ **Breathing:** Rate and effort

**Around Patient:**
☐ **Cyanosis:** Central (tongue, lips) or peripheral (fingers, toes)
☐ **Pallor:** Anemia
☐ **Malar flush:** Mitral stenosis (rare)

---

#### PART 3: Hands & Arms (2 minutes)

**HANDS:**
```
"May I look at your hands?"
```

☐ **Temperature:** Feel temperature of hands (cold peripheries = poor perfusion)
☐ **Color:** Pallor (anemia), cyanosis
☐ **Clubbing:** Check nail bed angle
  - Normal: >160 degrees
  - Clubbing: <180 degrees (loss of angle)
  - Causes: Congenital heart disease, endocarditis
☐ **Splinter hemorrhages:** Look under nails (endocarditis)
☐ **Osler's nodes:** Painful nodules on finger pads (endocarditis)
☐ **Janeway lesions:** Painless palmar/plantar macules (endocarditis)

**PULSE - Radial:**
```
"I'm going to check your pulse"
```

☐ **Location:** Radial artery at wrist
☐ **Technique:** Use 2 fingers (index + middle), not thumb
☐ **Assess:**
  - **Rate:** Count for 30 sec x 2 (or 15 sec x 4 if regular)
  - **Rhythm:** Regular or irregular?
  - **Character:** Volume/strength
☐ **Radio-radial delay:** Check both wrists simultaneously
☐ **Radio-femoral delay:** Check radial vs femoral (aortic coarctation)

**Normal Values:**
- Rate: 60-100 bpm
- Rhythm: Regular
- Volume: Normal/strong

**BLOOD PRESSURE:**
```
"I'm going to check your blood pressure"
```

☐ Appropriate cuff size
☐ Arm supported at heart level
☐ Inflate 20-30 mmHg above palpated systolic
☐ Deflate slowly (2-3 mmHg/second)
☐ Record systolic (first sound) and diastolic (disappearance of sound)

---

#### PART 4: Face & Neck (2 minutes)

**FACE:**
☐ **Eyes:**
  - Pallor (pull down lower lid - anemia)
  - Xanthelasma (cholesterol deposits)
  - Arcus senilis (white ring around cornea)
☐ **Mouth:**
  - Central cyanosis (tongue, lips)
  - Dental hygiene (endocarditis risk)
  - High arched palate (Marfan syndrome)

**NECK:**

**Jugular Venous Pressure (JVP):**
```
"I'm going to look at the veins in your neck"
```

☐ **Position:** Patient at 45 degrees
☐ **Technique:**
  - Look for internal jugular vein pulsation
  - Between sternocleidomastoid muscle and clavicle
  - NOT visible normally (if visible >45° = raised JVP)
☐ **Measure:** Vertical height above sternal angle
  - Normal: <3 cm above sternal angle
  - Raised: CCF, fluid overload, PE
☐ **Waveform:** a wave (atrial contraction), v wave (venous filling)

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ Confusing JVP with carotid pulse
- ❌ Patient not at correct angle
- ❌ Measuring from wrong landmark

**How to Distinguish JVP from Carotid:**
| JVP | Carotid |
|-----|---------|
| Not palpable | Palpable |
| Two-part waveform | Single pulse |
| Varies with position | Doesn't vary |
| Varies with breathing | Doesn't vary |
| Hepatojugular reflux | No change |

**Carotid Pulse:**
```
"I'm going to feel the pulse in your neck"
```

☐ **Technique:** Palpate gently, one side at a time (NEVER both simultaneously!)
☐ **Assess:**
  - **Rate & rhythm:** Should match radial
  - **Character:**
    - Slow rising: Aortic stenosis
    - Bounding: Aortic regurgitation
    - Normal: Single, smooth upstroke

  - **Character:**
    - Normal: Gentle tap
    - Hyperdynamic: Strong/thrusting
    - Heaving: Sustained (LV hypertrophy)
  - **Displacement:** Laterally = cardiomegaly

☐ **Heaves & Thrills:**
  - **Heave:** Palm over left sternal edge (RV hypertrophy)
  - **Thrill:** Palpable murmur (like cat purr)
    - Aortic: 2nd right ICS
    - Pulmonary: 2nd left ICS
    - Mitral: At apex

---

**AUSCULTATION:**

3. **Tricuspid:** 4th intercostal space, left sternal edge
4. **Mitral:** 5th intercostal space, mid-clavicular line (apex)

**Mnemonic: "All Physicians Take Money"**
- Aortic
- Pulmonary
- Tricuspid
- Mitral

**At Each Area:**
☐ Identify S1 (lub) and S2 (dub)
☐ Listen for extra sounds (S3, S4, clicks)

☐ **Bladder:**
  - Suprapubic dullness = full bladder

**ASCITES (Shifting Dullness):**

If abdomen distended:
☐ Percuss from midline (resonant) toward flank
☐ Note where becomes dull
☐ Keep finger on that spot
☐ Roll patient toward you
☐ Re-percuss same spot
☐ If now resonant = shifting dullness (ascites)

#### PART 9: Auscultation (30 seconds)

```
"I'm going to listen to your tummy"
```

☐ **Technique:**
  - Diaphragm of stethoscope
  - Listen in at least 2 areas
  - Listen for 30 seconds minimum

☐ **Bowel sounds:**
  - **Normal:** Gurgling, 2-5/minute
  - **Hyperactive:** Tinkling, frequent (obstruction, diarrhea)
  - **Absent:** No sounds for 2 minutes (ileus, peritonitis)

☐ **Vascular bruits:**
  - Renal arteries (renal artery stenosis)
  - Aorta (aneurysm)

---

#### PART 10: Completion

```
"To complete my examination, I would like to:
- Examine external genitalia and perform digital rectal examination
- Examine hernial orifices
- Perform urinalysis
- Check observations (temperature, BP)"
```

☐ **Hernias:** If indicated, examine with patient standing
☐ **Groin examination:** Lymph nodes, femoral pulses
☐ **Ankles:** Peripheral edema
