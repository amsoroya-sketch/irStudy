# SOAP Note Template

## What is a SOAP Note?

**SOAP** is a structured format for clinical documentation widely used in healthcare:

- **S** - Subjective (Patient's complaint in their own words)
- **O** - Objective (Examination findings, vitals, investigations)
- **A** - Assessment (Diagnosis or differential diagnosis)
- **P** - Plan (Management plan and follow-up)

## Why Use SOAP Format?

- **Systematic**: Ensures nothing is missed
- **Clear**: Easy for other healthcare providers to read
- **Efficient**: Structured format saves time
- **Standard**: Used across Australia and internationally
- **Legal**: Proper documentation for medical-legal purposes

### S - SUBJECTIVE

**Chief Complaint (CC):**
[Patient's main complaint in their own words, e.g., "I have chest pain"]

- **A**ssociations: Any other symptoms? (Nausea, sweating, shortness of breath, etc.)
- **T**ime course: Constant or intermittent? Getting better or worse?
- **E**xacerbating/Relieving factors: What makes it better or worse?
- **S**everity: On scale of 1-10, how severe?

For NON-PAIN complaints:
- Onset and duration
- Progression
- Associated symptoms
- Relieving/exacerbating factors
- Previous similar episodes
- Impact on daily activities

## Tips for Writing Good SOAP Notes

1. **Be concise but complete** - Include all relevant information, exclude irrelevant details
2. **Use medical terminology appropriately** - Be professional but clear
3. **Quote the patient** - Use quotation marks for subjective complaints
4. **Document negatives** - "No chest pain" is important information
5. **Be objective** - Facts, not interpretations in O section
6. **Support your assessment** - Link your diagnosis to your findings
7. **Be specific in plan** - Exact doses, exact timing, exact follow-up
8. **Think defensively** - Document safety netting and patient education
9. **Write legibly** - If handwritten, must be readable
10. **Time your documentation** - Aim for 10-15 minutes per note
