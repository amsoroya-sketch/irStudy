### For Documentation Practice:
1. Read the case
2. Write a complete SOAP note
3. Time yourself (aim for 10-15 minutes)
4. Include all relevant information
5. Develop differential diagnoses

### For Clinical Reasoning:
1. Identify red flags
2. List differential diagnoses
3. Justify investigations
4. Plan management systematically
