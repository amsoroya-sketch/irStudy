# Electronic Medical Records (EMR) Documentation Guide

## Purpose
This guide prepares you for documenting in Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems used in Australian hospitals, including Young District Hospital.

---

## What is an EMR?

**Electronic Medical Record (EMR)** = Digital version of patient medical records

### Common EMR Systems in NSW:
- **eMR (Electronic Medical Record)** - NSW Health's system
- **Clinical Portal** - Statewide system
- **PowerChart** (Cerner) - Used in some hospitals
- **Others** - Each hospital may have variations

**Note:** You'll receive specific training on the local EMR system when you arrive at Young District Hospital.

## Key Differences: Paper vs EMR

| Paper Notes | EMR |
|-------------|-----|
| Handwritten | Typed |
| Physically attached to patient | Accessible from anywhere |
| Can be lost | Backed up digitally |
| Slower to find information | Quick search function |
| Privacy by physical access | Privacy by password/login |
| Linear notes | Structured templates |

---

## EMR Documentation Basics

### 1. Login & Access
- **Unique login:** Never share your password
- **Log out:** Always log out when finished
- **Privacy:** Only access records you need for patient care
- **Audit trail:** Everything you do is tracked

### 2. Patient Safety
- **Right patient:** Always verify patient details before documenting
- **Check MRN:** Medical Record Number must match
- **Check DOB:** Date of birth must match
- **Two patient identifiers:** Use at least two (name + DOB, or name + MRN)

### 3. Documentation Principles
- **Same as paper:** Same professional standards apply
- **Timely:** Document as soon as possible after seeing patient
- **Accurate:** Factual, objective, complete
- **Clear:** Use appropriate medical terminology
- **Permanent:** Can't truly delete - amendments are tracked

---

## EMR Structure (Typical)

### Patient Summary Screen
Usually shows:
- **Demographics:** Name, age, DOB, MRN
- **Allergies:** Prominently displayed (often in red)
- **Active problems:** Current diagnoses
- **Current medications:** What patient is on
- **Recent vitals:** Latest observations
- **Alerts:** Important warnings

### Common Sections/Tabs:
1. **Notes:** Progress notes, admission notes, discharge summaries
2. **Orders:** Medication orders, investigation orders
3. **Results:** Bloods, imaging, other investigations
4. **Medications:** Current and past medications
5. **Allergies:** Drug and other allergies
6. **Vital Signs:** Obs charts, fluid balance
7. **History:** Past medical history, surgical history
8. **Documents:** Scanned external documents

---

## Documentation Templates in EMR

### Progress Note Template (Daily Notes)
Most EMR systems have templates. Common format:

```
Date/Time: [Auto-filled]
Author: [Your name - auto-filled]
Service: [e.g., General Medicine]

SUBJECTIVE:
[How patient is today, complaints, overnight events]

OBJECTIVE:
Vitals: BP ___ HR ___ RR ___ Temp ___ SpO2 ___
Examination: [Relevant findings]
Results: [New investigation results]

ASSESSMENT:
[Current diagnosis/working diagnosis]
[Patient progress - improving/stable/deteriorating]

PLAN:
1. [Specific action]
2. [Specific action]
3. [Review timing]

[Your name]
[Your position: e.g., ICRP participant]
[Date/Time]
```

### Admission Note Template
```
ADMISSION NOTE

Presenting Complaint:
HPC:
PMH:
Medications:
Allergies:
FH:
SH:

O/E:
Vitals:
General:
Systems examination:

Investigations:
[Results of initial tests]

Impression:
[Diagnosis/differential]

Plan:
1. Admit to [ward]
2. Investigations: [ordered]
3. Treatment: [medications/interventions]
4. Monitoring: [what to monitor]
5. Review: [when]

[Signature block]
```

## Typing in EMR: Special Considerations

### Speed Matters More in EMR
- **Real-time documentation:** Often documenting while with patient or immediately after
- **Templates help:** But you still need to type patient-specific information
- **Auto-correct issues:** Medical terms may not be in dictionary
- **Target speed:** 40+ WPM makes EMR documentation much faster

### Common EMR Typing Challenges

**Challenge 1: Medical terms not recognized**
- Solution: Add medical terms to personal dictionary
- Solution: Know correct spelling so you can override autocorrect

**Challenge 2: Structured fields**
- Templates have specific fields to complete
- Tab key moves between fields
- Practice tabbing efficiently

**Challenge 3: Dropdown menus vs free text**
- Some fields are dropdown (select from list)
- Some are free text (type what you want)
- Know when to use which

**Challenge 4: Copy-paste temptation**
- DON'T copy-paste without reviewing
- DON'T carry forward incorrect information
- DO update daily with actual current information

---

## EMR Best Practices

### DO:
✅ Verify correct patient before documenting
✅ Document in real-time or as soon as possible
✅ Use clear, professional language
✅ Include all relevant information
✅ Document patient education and consent
✅ Document safety netting advice
✅ Sign/authenticate your notes
✅ Log out when done

### DON'T:
❌ Share your login
❌ Leave computer unlocked
❌ Access records you don't need
❌ Copy-paste without verifying
❌ Use inappropriate abbreviations
❌ Document opinions as facts
❌ Delay documentation
❌ Alter notes without proper amendment process

## Common EMR Tasks You'll Perform

### 1. Writing Progress Notes
- Daily notes on ward round
- Review notes after seeing patient
- Handover notes

### 2. Ordering Investigations
- Blood tests
- Imaging (X-ray, CT, ultrasound)
- Other tests (ECG, urine, etc.)

### 3. Prescribing Medications (under supervision)
- **VERY IMPORTANT:** Medication orders are high-risk
- Double-check: Right patient, right drug, right dose, right route, right time
- Check allergies first
- Check drug interactions
- Get senior to verify

### 4. Viewing Results
- Check blood results
- Review imaging reports
- Check microbiology results

### 5. Communication
- Referrals to other teams
- Discharge summaries
- Letters to GP

## Documentation Speed Goals

### By End of ICRP Preparation:
- **Progress note:** 5-10 minutes
- **Admission note:** 15-20 minutes
- **Discharge summary:** 20-30 minutes

### During ICRP:
- Speed will improve with:
  - Familiarity with local EMR system
  - Practice with templates
  - Improved clinical knowledge
  - Better typing speed

## Legal & Ethical Considerations

### Documentation is a Legal Document
- Can be used in court
- Can be subpoenaed
- Permanent record
- Professional responsibility

### Privacy & Confidentiality
- **ONLY** access records you need for patient care
- Don't access:
  - Your own record
  - Family members (unless you're their treating doctor)
  - Friends
  - Celebrities
  - Anyone you're not actively treating
- Breach = serious consequences (dismissal, legal action)

### Audit Trails
- Every access is logged
- Every change is tracked
- Timestamp on everything
- Can't hide what you've accessed

---

## Common EMR Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Wrong patient:** Always verify before documenting
2. **Copy-paste errors:** Don't copy outdated information
3. **Incomplete notes:** Missing key information
4. **Delayed documentation:** Document promptly
5. **Privacy breaches:** Only access when needed
6. **Sharing passwords:** Never share login
7. **Leaving computer unlocked:** Always lock screen
8. **Informal language:** Maintain professionalism
